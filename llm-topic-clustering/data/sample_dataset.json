This frees the\nSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to\nstart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the\nbus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are\nready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.\n\nOn an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked\nthe data and transfered it.

Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.

Miller (1939).\n\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\nthe other way around.\n\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

The concepts of \"right\"\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\n\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\n\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\n\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\nof the position.\n\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold\ndifferent moral values (feelings).", "<<I wrote>\n<Is there a resource available to the consumer comparing all of the makes\n<and models of automobiles, trucks, vans, etc. for survivability in a\n<crash of different severities?\n<...\n<Also, I've found very little objective data comparing different\n<vehicles for handling, pick-up, braking, expected maintenance, etc.\n<I recall years ago Consumer Reports annual buyer's guide was much more\n<informative in those aspects than it is now.\n\nThanks to a reply from someone I looked a little further and found what\nI was looking for.

I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.

If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't\nbe using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds\nto play sounds on it. It works great.

I was doing continuous background sound with\ninterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V\ndocumentation.\n\nYou probably were cancelling your callback commands out of\nyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\n\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\nit.

But if I operate on a person and he lives\nnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''\n    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,\nthe Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of\nthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the\nsuffering of the thousands trapped there.\n    ``I lived through hell together with the people of\nSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest\nheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.\n    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant\nat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he\nhad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says\nhe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for\nguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without\nanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean\nsections.\n    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the\nfirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000\npatients.\n    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from\nTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people\ncarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him\nthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.\n    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells\nlanded within one minute in an area half the size of a football\nfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of\nthe dead were women and children.\n    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the\nchildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the\nblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.\n    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not\npiece them together. One woman holding her two children in her\nhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no\nheads.''\n    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were\ndeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had\nthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.\n    The six general practitioners who had been operating before\nhe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They\ndidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''\n    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by\nmid-September he had run out of supplies.\n    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes\nthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no\nanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain\nbecause it increased bleeding.\n    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and\nstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were\nimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.\n    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.\n    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived\nfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.\n    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in\nmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the\nregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''\n    Then the hunger set in.\n    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began\nair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day\nfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.\n    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the\npeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.\n    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in\nSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.\n    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after\nvisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.\n    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of\npeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when\nI left. And I cried too.''\n", "\nDunno, the newpaper article I read didn't say (I was wondering the same\nthing).

A\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\nACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\n\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school's position\nsomewhat disheartening.\n\nI understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\nturn into no position at all?\n\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\n\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\nLenin. Now, that's ironic!\n\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\narena acknowledges it as valid.\n\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\nschools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\nmoral and ethical decisions.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\nname.)\n\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don't have the kinds\nof morals I want taught.

The United States\n delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came \n to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, \n their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation\n was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed\n by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns\n before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped\n that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of \n February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region\n of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According\n to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the\n aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,\n many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women\n have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who\n were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the\n mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity \n and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the\n Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order \n to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities \n committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims\n be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,\n and honour of the Muslims be protected.\"\n\n\nSerdar Argic", "[discussing the use of IRQ 7]\n\n\n\nTo put it a little differently:\n\n - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the\n   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.\n\n - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's\n   time to send out another byte to the printer.\n\n - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\n   in the high-impedence mode.\n\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \n   disconnected by a jumper.\n\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.

Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.

Starting with 20\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\n\n \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\n  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\"[1]\n\n[1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \"The\n    Armenian Displaced Persons,\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,\n    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.\n\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\nSerdar Argic", "May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_\n \nMOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in\nArmenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for\nallegedly \"carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers.\" \n\nA statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey\nsaid \"the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,\" the \nRussian state news agency Itar-tass reported. \n\nBut the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed\nover to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. \n\n\"This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have\ncommitted crimes,\" the statement reads. \n\nThe five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison\nsentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar\ndistrict of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. \n\nThe Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a\ncompany of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which\nthey were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to \ncarry out diversions against Azeri troops. \n\nHowever, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the\nRussian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in\nthe battle zone round Karabakh. \n\nNagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for\nfive years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has\nleft many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. \n\nBoth Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed\nin these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the \nSoviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. \n\nThe statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the\nAzerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the\nsix men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. \n\nIt said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request \nto his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense\nattorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency. \n \n \n", "Hi,  I have a few questions about laying out a PCB.

Also, H2SO4\nis in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of\nPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.\n\n\nAs it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).\n(More about this later.)\n\nWhat actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:\n(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)\nThe battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\n\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\n\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\nare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore\nthe lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with\nthese products for a newer battery.\n\n[stuff deleted]\n[stuff deleted]\n\nThis stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.\nIn fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher\ntemperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:\n\"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to\n -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.\"  We all know from experience (at\n least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is\nnot true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm\nthe battery.\n\n(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge\n to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any\n such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.

You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\n\n\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

The world now has almost 10\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\n  dramatically.\n\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\n  of Seven nations.\n\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\n  overall U.S. economy.\n\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\n\n    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\n  reduce demand.\n\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\n  at the expense of the individual.\n\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\nAvailable from:\n  Cato Institute\n  224 Second Street SE\n  Washington, DC  20003\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                        The Cato Institute\n\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\n    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\n  of the American Revolution.\n    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\n  civil liberties.\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\n  no government funding.

Why do I say this?\nBecause by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which\nyou write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are\nattempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.\nYours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you\nbecause your god doesn't exist.\n\n\nI am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.\nWhat I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.\n\n\nBe true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\n\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\n\n\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\n\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\n\n\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\n\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\n\n\nAnd in John 3:16:\n\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\n   life.\"\n\n\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.\n\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\n\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\n\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\n", "Sorry to waste the bandwidth.

However, if he enjoyed\npunishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus\nto \"seek and save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10)?\n\nYou asked for it.\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.\nMatthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in\nGod's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the\ndisciples \"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out\nfrom the presence of the Lord\".\n2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth\nbeing condemned.\nRevelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes\nand those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\nthe \"fiery lake of burning sulfur\".\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\n\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\" and there being \"no rest day or\nnight\" for them because of it.\nPsalm 9:17:  \"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\nforget God.\"\n\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\n\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[In the following I'm mostly playing \"devil's advocate\".  I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.", "\nIt is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in\ntheir signatures (I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your\nposting).

One can see the use of cut outs for\nprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,\nstealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice\nfrom a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with\na particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and \ndistribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen\nclipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not \nsufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.\nThis could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or\nspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted\nstream.\n\nDetection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned\nscheme.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nIf you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use\nthem in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid\nlaw enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching\nthe remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet\ndeliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement\nblock.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.\n\nThe M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\n\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\ninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's\nsupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to\nthe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants\nan encryption chip with a real time clock?\n\n*****************************************************************************", "However, this has nothing to do with motorcycling, unless you consider\nthe Amazona a bike.", "\nNever had any problem with mine...\n\nAre you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2\" hex?  13mm\nis just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won't fit on a GM 13mm\nnut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric\nthreads too.

I thought the whole idea of God coming\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\ntime we need him most.\n\n\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\northodox doctrine.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\").  \n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\n\n\n\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\nnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \n\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\ncosts.  \n\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\ncondenser area.\n\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\npressure.\n\n\nTrue.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and\nfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard \nstepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.\nThe plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood\nthe costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a few\ndozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved\noxygen.

This FAQ is so full of error that I\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\npartisan theology.\n\n\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\n\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\n\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\n\n4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\nAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\n\n\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\n\n\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\n\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\nday of the moral law.\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\nmake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\n\nDarius\n\n[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\nthink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\n\nHowever I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\n\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \n\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \n\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\nworship was.", "\nSecular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life,\nIslam places the rights of society and every member in it above \nthe rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.\n\n\nAs a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land\nI live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my \nlife.

This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED\n   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\n   VRAM.\n\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\n\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\n      be.\n\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\n\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\n   to do).

This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.\n\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers.

The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the\n    intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in\n    this group.

It's a very biblical doctrine as\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\n  \n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \n  allies.\n  \n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\n  \n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \n  \n                                more\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \t     \t       \t    (OVER)\n\f\n                                  2\n  \n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\n  \n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tSincerely,\n  \n  \n  \n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tWILLIAM J.

The Administration is \nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \non its government's commitment to reform.\n\n\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\n\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\n\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\n\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\n\n\nReview of COCOM\n\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\n\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\n\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \nother states.\n\n\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\n\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \nthis process.\n\n\nMultilateral Test Ban\n\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \nand that the two governments would consult with each other \naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \nmonths.    \n\n\nDetargeting\n\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \n\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\n\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \nlate May.\n\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\n\n\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\n\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \nreform in Russia and the other states.\n\n                           *    *    *\n\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \nstates.", "\nNo no no!!!

While\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\n\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\nceremony itself.\n\n\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\n\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\n\nWritings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\n\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\ndon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\n\n\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\n\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\nwhich I have taken a few:\n\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\n\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\n(Matt. 19:11).\n\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow\" (John 16:12).\n\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\n\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\n\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\n\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\n\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\nwere actually taught openly.\n\n\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\nconnection has yet been established.\n\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu", "The good news is we just got two Sparc10's.

It's almost an epidemic in this country.\n\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?

Ever read Animal Farm?\n#>#>\n#>#That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism.

The word you're groping for is \"some\".\n#>\n# \n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\n#theology.\n\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \n# \n# \n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\n#>\n#>No shit, Sherlock.

Older original deskjet and\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\n\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\n\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\nservice center for further information.\n\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\n\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\n\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\n\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\nproblem.\n\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\nlaserjet IV.\n\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\n\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\n\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\n\n", "\n\nThere is no database for infantile spasms, nor a newsgroup, that I\nknow of.

What's\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\nenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\n\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\n\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\n\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\n\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\nevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\n\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\n\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\n[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\n\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\ndoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\nChristians.\n\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\neven (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don't\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\n\nLet's move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\n\"equivalent\" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\n\n\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\n\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\n\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\n\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\nour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\n\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\n\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\n\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew's\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\nof the synoptic tradition?\n\nI'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into \nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\nwe are faced with as Christians.

A \"quick\nlook\" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in\nthe theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\nlocal prophets.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n(for better or for worse).\n\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\na portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\nframes.\n\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\nfor the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\nThat's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\naction, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\nease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\nswitching.\n\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\neven more...", "I'm posting this for a friend, but you can e-mail questions to me at\ngyeh@cc.bellcore.com  However, the best way to get your questions answered\nis to call the phone number listed.\n\nFOR SALE:\n\n1991 Volkswagon Corrado\n\n\t2+2 coupe\n\tLow mileage: approx. 28,000 miles\n\t5-speed manual\n\t7 speaker factory Blaupunkt stereo system\n\tNew all-weather Yokohamas 205/50VR15\n\tSun roof\n\tAC\n\tRed\n\tSpeed activated spoiler\n\tExtra set of tires - Pirelli P600 195VR15\n\n\t** Equipped with factory Winter package - heated seats, \n           mirrors and nozzles.\n\n\t** Alpine security system with 2 remotes.\n\n\tAll records - documentation, service\n\tPampered car, mint condition\n\n\tMust sacrifice at $11,000 or best offer.", "\n\nPoint 1:\n\nI'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole\n\"yeast issue\" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings\nof words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\notherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional\n\"difficult\" patient.\n\nPoint 2:\n\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\na treatment point-of-view.\n\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\n\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\nfrom them.\n\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\n\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.

But since you asked \"Why not,\" I'll\nrespond.\n\nPutting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other\nfactors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control\nis difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to \nincorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).\nMicrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.\nDon't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely\nto look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer\nfabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.\n\nBecause almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used\ntheir pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though\nthey had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.\n\nThe inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The\nspace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to\ntemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation\neffects on materials), so your \"fabric\" may not retain any flexibility\nfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure\nchanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could\nlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.\n\nThese are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal\nfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of\nsuccess.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368", "\n\nWell, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you\n(or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding\nmating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to\ndisprove the general trend of natural morality.

The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\ncontainer.\n\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\ninformation.\n\n\tAndy\n\n\n\n-- ", "Hi,\n\nI'm looking to buy a 17\" monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide what\nmonitor I should buy.

The general setup is designed so that when users \n\tconnect they send a private key encrypted using the system public\n\tkey and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the\n\tone-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The\n\tresult of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it\n\tis impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the\n\tmachine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed\n\tsystem private key to entice users into revealing thier personal\n\tprivate keys during the authentication sequence.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\tDoes the fact that the system private key does not provide any\n\tinformation useful for a search give me any protection as far as\n\tbeing coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)\n\n\tIt seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am\n\tassisting in \"entrapment\" (the users would send thier key anyway\n\tand are not being enticed into doing something they would not\n\totherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?\n\n\tWould the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?\n\nAny answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...\n\njim", "I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it.

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n", "Well put, Jason.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.

The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.

As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's \nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\nuses Xsi.\n\nOur toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.\nIn order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\nand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\n\nWe need a function to do this.

Later, Mr. \nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\n\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\n\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict.\n\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\n\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\n\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\n\nNow any comment?\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \"it is\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?  \n \n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \n \n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\n has so many \"craps\" in the 1993. \n \n Any question?\n \nSerdar Argic", "\n: The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given\n: the metal frame and all.

Perhaps some of the people in our population are\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\n\nWe can look for correlations in the population.

The length of the streak doesn't\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\n\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn't\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\nway.\n\n\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\nand then reverses.", "\nOh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\nis only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \n\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights's comment that Witt's \"sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \n\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\n\n--Rex", "\nOf all the stupid postings you've brought here recently, it is\nilluminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the\nstupidest of them.\n\n\nDoes this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the Arab\nstates? \n\n\nApparently, your answer is yes.\n\n\nAttempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and\nnon-traditional terrorist means has also failed.

Too much can block the\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\nown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and\nfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen\nperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)\nand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  \nfirmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the\ntenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl \nunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try\nadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up\nthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also\nsafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse\nit out.\nGood Luck\n-heather\n", ": >I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n: >  or where-ever.

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\n\nJoe Buehler\n\n...\n\nSchism and Disobedience\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\n\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\nheresy.\"\n\n...\n\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\n\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\nresponse.\n\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\nagainst the unity of the Church.\n\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\n\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\n\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\nparallel Church.\n\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\n\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\n\n....\n\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\n\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:", "FOR SALE:\n\n\t1 ST4766E Seagate ESDI drive.  760 meg\t\t$500\n\t  unformatted.

Previously\na MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the\nsystems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for\nthe presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works\nfine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer\nof the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)\nmight help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some\nsuggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications\nproblem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?\nMoreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought\nthat the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). \nAre there any MC68882RC33?", "I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\n\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\nthe subkeys even more.\n\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\nmake sure they stop''.\n\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\nthe warrant.\n\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\nlong.\n\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\nwithout the back door.", "\nWell, where is he?

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\nguaranteed to be mapped.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.", "\n\nBowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style\nplayer.  He plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive\nresponsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his\nice time.\n\nJagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a \"me first\" attitude.\nThis rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.\n\nThroughout the year, Francis consistently recieved more ice time than\nJagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty\nsure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When\nyou add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident\nthat Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.", "\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure I understand this question.

Other\nthan that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on\na base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,\nif the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and\nif the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.\n", "\nMoreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as\nfar as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the\ncompound when the first shots were fired.

(This time meeting all the\nrequirements of myth.)\n\n\nAh, but not everyone \"knows\" that god exists.  So you have\na fallacy.\n\n\nAnd that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy?\nRead the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read.\n(Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)\n\n\n...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting\nit across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't\nmake it any more credible to me.\n\nIf the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason\nto doubt the Bible, because not everyone \"knows\" your alleged\ngod's alleged existance.\n\n\n1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far\nfrom universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\nit is only a proof that some people have thought that there\nwas a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been\nwriting it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the\ncase of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the\nonly thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.\nAnd that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the\ninterpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.\n\n2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.\n\n3) Again, read the FAQ.\n\n\nBzzt...wrong answer!\nGravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and\nrationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the\nother hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except\non the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence.\nGravity is obvious; gods aren't.\n\n\nNo, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of\n\"God\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \"god\".\nIn other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian\ngod, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much\nof oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as\nthe idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces\nare and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,\nhuman nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to\nbe and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural\ntendancy to believe in \"God\" only exists in religious wishful\nthinking.\n\n\nXtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and\nit's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence.\nDivine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already\nbelieve in the divinity.\nFirst, not all atheists believe the same things about human\nnature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not,\nYOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at\nthe least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric\napproach.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object\nis apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there\neven though it is not detectable.\n\nYour description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but\nI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions\ncan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I\nmisunderstood?\n\n\nMy p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and\nhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\n    panning for each voice\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\n    access to all eight voices\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \n    modulation sources and routings.\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\n    the SQ-80.\n\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\n\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\nto use so I have avoided it.\n\nREASON FOR SALE:\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\n\nPRICING AND TERMS:\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.

I never said that the Law was made\nobsolete by Jesus.\n\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the \nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \nsites?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three \nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\n\t     \n\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \nthey have troops on the ground there.\n\t     \n\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \nthink we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a \npolicy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can I follow up?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \nto stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.\n\t     \n\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making \nprogress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and \nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \nthe region.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the \nsituation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I \ndon't know that the administration could have made it different.\n\t     \n\t     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the \nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies \nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \nin only a decade.  \n\t     \n\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \nThat's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \nare moving in the right direction economically.\n\t     \n\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \ndidn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \nThere are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I \njust disagree with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been \nunderway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \nargument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates \nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \nforward.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just \nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \nbasically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days \nwith regard to the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Waco --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have \nmuch to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \ninsights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole \nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry \nthat they killed their children.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \nPerot said today that you're playing games with the American people \nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \npackage.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign \nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \nresubmit them to the Hill?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \nWe're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going \nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \nthat rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. \nPerot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a \nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if \nmaybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and \nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \npolitical criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you \nthink you can sit back and just --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's \nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's \ngot some constructive ideas.  \n\t     \n\t     I think the American people have shown that they're very \nimpatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one \nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \neven if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my \njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will \nchange people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \ndebate and not just to the President.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \nunilaterally?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \nmandate of the United Nations.\n\n\t     Q\t  But you have a mandate and --\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \nthat we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for \naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \nWe are not.  \n\n\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \nwe have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French \nand others about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would that be military action?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in \nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \ngrip?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's \nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \nthese are things you said that you didn't support.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we \nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \nqualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \ndon't know exactly what he said.\n\t     \n\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss \nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going \nto do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies \nspeaking out of school.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's \na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had \na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a \nline against an administration policy.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I \ndon't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \nBut I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies \nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \nwhen you tell people they can't do certain things in this country \nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\n\t     \n\t     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been \nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \nof their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \non this issue?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \nof emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \nand in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to \nsee it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my \ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \nand that's what I'll continue to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \nBosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on \nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \nyour decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on \nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \ndecision?  \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There \nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \nrequired to embark on any new policy.\n\t     \n\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \nwar.  \n\t     \n\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\n\t     \n\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't \ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \nwe couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \nthese wars?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument \nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  \nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \nof ethnic tensions exist.\n\n\t     Q\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \nYeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the \nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \n\n\t     Q\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more \ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \nhandle that situation differently now?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that \nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come \nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to \nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \nhave asked.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \nSessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \nhis future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing \nbefore you do decide?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \nI'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \nto do with the direction of the FBI.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \ntake a partisan view in this war?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \nbe successful.\n\t     \n\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \nlooking at what else we can do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \nAren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \nGermany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've \ngot all of our options under review.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \nmilitary operation?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  \nThat's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \nde facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  \nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \npower.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're \ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \n\t     \n\t     I do believe that there's every reason to think that \nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail \nthere.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of \nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\n\t     \n\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \nrefinance their debt.  \n\t     \n\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \ntough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  \nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the \ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \nof this country.  \n\t     \n\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \nmillions of Americans.  \n\t     \n\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \nSo I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  \nI feel good about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that \none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \npractically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own \ncountry, how can we do it for them?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \nIt's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be \nfair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \nbe tied by many members of Congress.\n\n\t     Q\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \nThe Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and \nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \npursued.  \n\n\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \nwill do that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \n\n\t     Q\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \norder to then build support for Russian aid?\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \ntoward reform.\n\t     \n\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \neconomy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And \nin a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all \nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \nbecause they haven't produced the results that the people so \nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \n\t     \n\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \nthat's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \nthink that we should support that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready \nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \nagreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental \nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \n\t     \n\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \nposition, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty \nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an \nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \nviolating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an \napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out \nthe details of that.\n\t     \n\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only \nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \nregion, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \n\t     \n\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot \nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \nknow, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for \nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong \nabout the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not \nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \ndetails needed to be improved.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\n\t     \n\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \nevaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \nthink that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \ninterchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know \nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't \nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I \nwas encouraged by the last trip.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \nus to confirm good faith?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases \nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \nthose cases.  And we're not there yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \nvery influenced by how the families feel.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \nDole?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \n\t     \n\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \nPresident, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all \nstrung out and we're divided.\"  \n\t     \n\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \nhundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could \nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \nBut the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     and redo --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \nwe need more police officers on the street.  \n\t     \n\t     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once \nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \nstreet who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's \nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \nright to know the names of the senior officers?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \nan Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I \nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \nmight be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think \nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I \nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \n\t     \n\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \ncon.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing \nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \nforces, sir?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \ninto a ground war there?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our \nevaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never \nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \nparticipating in some of the activities? \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why not?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't \nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \nbe done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of \nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \nAnd that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \nbe here, but for others as well.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.", "\nHere again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the\nbiblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the\nmodern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n\nYou are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the\nfoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.\nSee B.

", "\n\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\n\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).

Up north, you're so much more\nlikely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health\ninsurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...\n\n\nYes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document\n  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.

Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.

I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B.

If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

There\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\nas salary.\n\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\n\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\n\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\nget supported, and how much.  \n\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\nwhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \n\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.", "I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.

The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\nmade public.\n\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\nfor this product.

Ex-members describe him in ways not dissimilar \n:to the way Jim Jones has been described.\n\nI don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never\nconvicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for\nchild abuse.  Their purview (in this case) is strictly in firearms violations,\nso this information is irrelevant to the discussion.\n\n:FBI agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background \n:checks.

Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\n\nWhat's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call.

Who \"tosses out\"\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\nascribes this more broadly.\n\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\nthis way by a critical reader.\n\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\nit bit him on the keister twice.\n\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\nauthor's history of whatever.)\n\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\nthe text provide evidence?\n\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\nthan teach history.\n\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's \"Historian's Fallacies\"\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\nto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.

(alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \n", "\n\nAT the MICRO$OFT display at FOSE, there were a few computers running\nwindows, and win. apps for the  blind, I think.

In their names we demand justice.\n\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \ncrime encouraged.

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.

There are\nverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments\nabusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid\nto worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused\nin thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person\nwill stop putting his hand on the stove.\n\n\n       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell\npork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  \n\n       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust\nthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed\nto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies\ntotal government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.\n\n\n       This is very likely.\n\n\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\nheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.\n\n\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\nhalf the per-car death rate.\n\n\n      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\nirrelevent.\n\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\n\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\n\n\n\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got\nmore knives or fists.  \n\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\nare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is \nviolent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\nyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\n\n\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\n\n\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\nwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\n\n       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If\nyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\nsimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\n\n\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\n\n       You may take that for what it's worth.\n", "\n\n\nYou might be sure, but you would also be wrong.\n", "\n\nAh, double-fulfillment.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.", "\nThe test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its\nstupidity.

Clarke\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\nOrig. Ed. 1993\nPre-publication $84.50\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\n\n\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\nreach them.   \n\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\n\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\nfictional\n\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\narchives\n\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\n\nABOUT RON MILLER\n\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\nspots.]\n\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\nSmithsonian* magazine\n\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\n\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \n\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\n\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\n\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nPO Box 9542\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\nUSA\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\nFax (407)951-3671\n\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\nadditional book.  \n\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\nadditional.

The 51 day\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\nassigning blame.\n\n\\\n\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\n{\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\n[Reno's] decision.''\n\n\\\n\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\nto show their might and just purpose.\n\n\\\n\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\n\n\\\n\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\n\n\\\n\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\nBranch Davidians.\n\n\\\n\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\nand a city block razed.\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\it This policy of no-knock\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures''] are not denied.\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\noindent Matthew L.

Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-\nnation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later\ntimes, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first\ntwo millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes \nimportant that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our \nunderstanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the \nsignificance of this idea.

This\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\n\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\nand isn't.  \n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\nis an attractive option.\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\nsexuality.

If it's too traumatic they never recall\nwhy they were punished.

It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.

And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving.

When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

This is really bad journalism.", "Folks,\n\nIt's time to start building some precise questions to send to our\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\nasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \n\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\n     the BATF obtained?\n\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \n     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant \n     in a manner prescribed by law?\n\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\n     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \n\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\n     dispossessed weapons.\n\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\n\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\n     situation? \n\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\n\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\n\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \n     penetrated?\n\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\n\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\n\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\n     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is \n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\n\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \n     shots from high-power rifles?\n\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\n\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?", "Well, it seems the \"National Sales Tax\" has gotten its very\n      own CNN news LOGO!\n\n      Cool.

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.\n                                                                                                          ", "Once upon a time, long long ago in this news group, someone\nposted a schematic for a 1-bit A/D converter.

The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

Would I want to in this\ncase? \n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks, ", "\nIndeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:\n\n  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often\n  since the foundation of the world; but now once at\n  the consummation He has been manifested to put away \n  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.\n\n  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die\n  once, and after this comes judgement;\n\n  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear\n  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to\n  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.\n\n\nThe first point is that this verse is part of an even larger\ncontext, the subject of which is not the destiny of the\nindividual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's\nsacrifice, \"once\", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen \nmankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \n\"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \nof Christ's deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\n\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\ndeath.\n\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\n\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\n\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\n\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \nnot the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.", "\n\n\tMay I ask why they are afraid to do so?\n\n---\n\n  Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a\n  term paper handed in by a freshman.

Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n\tdevices.\n\n74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet.", "\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.

As his guilt has not been established, it is\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\n\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \ndistinction.\n\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \noutwardly profess\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\n\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu'min\", which means \"true\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\nwill not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu'min\", or \"true believer\" in\nIslam.", "\nNo, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.\nI've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists\nthat he has, so I'd love to have a cite.\n\n\nWrong.

Worth as measured in \nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\nof a word. 6.

Even the usages of the\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\n\"objective values.\"\n\nBack to the present.

I do actually quote some things\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\nI want to say.\n\n\nThere's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\nteam and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\n\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto 'humans', and \"organ Z\" onto\n'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'\nabove might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\n\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\n\n\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\n\n\nIn this cases, we're seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\n\n\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\nit's unclear what it all really means.\n\n***\n\nNow just one more un-related point:\n\n\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference\nbetween the winners and the losers.\n\nMoreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\n\n\nSince stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\neven though I'm relying on stats to do it.", "\nDo you mean that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior in _some_ respects (which\nis trivially true), that it is objectively inferior in _all_ respecets\n(which is trivially false) or do you mean something else?

After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\n\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\n\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\neen apart vel.\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\n\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\ntrachten te verklaren.\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\n\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

That is the job of\nthe Holy Spirit.  And I, frankly, make a lousy one.  I am only\nhere to testify.  Your conversion is between you and God.  I am\n\"out of the loop\".  If you decide to follow Jesus, of which I\nindeed would be estatic, then all the glory be to God.\n", ": I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where\n: Christians were called to \"repent\" of America's \"national\" sins, such\n: as sexual promiscuity.\n: \n: To which I reply: ...whoa there!\n: \n: How can I repent of _someone else's_ sin?   I can't.\n: \n: And when I claim to \"repent\" of someone else's sin, am I not in fact\n: _judging_ him?  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us\n: not to judge people. \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\"\n: \n: C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II,\n: when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging \"national repentance\"\n: for the horrors (sins???) of World War II.\n: -- \n\nI see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree.\n\nTo repent means to turn around.  We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly\narrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to\nparticipate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God.  We\nhave arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed\nus the luxury of living in this land.  We have set a bad example for other\nnations.  We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions.  We have\nstricken the name of God from the classroom.  We've cheated God out of the\nhonor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public\nas our sins have been.\n\nWhen Jesus said \"Judge not that ye be not judged\", he was not addressing\nthose like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to\nrepent.  He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down\ncondemnation on others for their sins.  His message to us all was to remove\nthe log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's.  But\nHe also said to rebuke and to reprove.  Don't forget that this is a command\ntoo.\n\nOur problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were\nrebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the\nexcuse that we don't want to judge anyone.\n\nIn truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more\nand to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives.  Call sin\nwhat it is and do so openly.  Let it's charge fall correctly where it should.\nBut instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their\nhellward path and onto the heavenward path.\n\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\n\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\n\t We must reach the root of the evil...\n\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\n\t from the dreadful deed...\n\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\n\t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\n\t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\n\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\n\t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"", "If you're thinking of reactive polymers they're making ESD safe\ncontau\biners out of it.

Hence, I find it difficult to\nunderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't\nhave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote\nout of context.  \n\nI asked Jim the following:\n\nJim replied by saying \n\nBut today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject\n\"Silence is concurrence\":  \n\n\nWhich is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of\ncontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on\nt.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.\n\nDoes \"silence is concurrence\" imply that Jim thinks that because I\ndidn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes\nout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this\nquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.\n\n\nBut back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next \ngambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he\nconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled \"Inductive Logic\":\n\n\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\nbut not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\nWell, I can't see where he is going with this.\n\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\n\nThink hard about this Jim.

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for\nthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as\nthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture\nquality if your dithering works right).\n\nI can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to\nGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.\nYou don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA\ncard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+\ncomputers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a\n8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write\nsome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other\ncolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg\ndithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette\nthe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would\nwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but\nit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way\ngives a brighter more detailed image.\n\nAnyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as\nfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the\nVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)\n\nHave a day!", "\n\n\tHmmm.  \"Check your facts.\"  Good advice.

Furthermore,\nany use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent\nlaw, is similarly unlawful.  Therefore, the \"average citizen\" cannot use\nRSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.\n\nThere is no licensed, freely available product in the US that uses RSA\nencryption other than RSAREF (and hence RIPEM), at least as far as I am\naware.

One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm\n   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the \"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.

We\nwere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the\nPalestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\nstatement: \"You look for me !\", i.e., I'am not making any more\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\ngovernment's and his party's lack of action for human rights and\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\n\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\nmarginal byproduct of this \"government of peace\", which need not\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \"Rabinic\"\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\n\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\nto propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the\nPalestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\n\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\nseparation and 'the future of the territories', must come to\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\n'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\nquo>.\n\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\nits burden. [.....].\n\n\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\nthus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\".", "\n\nWas it Pascal, or maybe Descartes, who first used this figure of speech? \nI seem to have some vague recollections from reading some of their essays,\nbut I certainly couldn't say it was one of them for sure.\n", "\n\tWhy don't you consider PHIGS in X or PEX lib?", "As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  \nlate.

(Of course, this was\nall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy\nconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough\nsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as\nexactly what he actually said...\n\nKates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire\nthan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not\ndiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.\n\nKoresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This\nisn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has\nbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel\nhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to\npeople like Koresh.\n\nLengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.\nThere were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.\nPolice originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they\ncalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for\nprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were\nchanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many\nsmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not\nlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of\norganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the\nFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they\nwere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).\n\"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that\npower.\"\n\nThe BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid\nillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners\nno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills\ndisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its\nexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.\nAround the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media\nis alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a\npre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door\nand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a\ngun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't\ninvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but\nif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents\nremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in\nchains.\n\nThe Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for\nreview.\n\nKates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and\nthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot\nat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100\nagents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had\nsome medical personnel on hand.\n\nHe confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest\nin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on\nthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and\nthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could\nbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns\nback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached\nrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.\n\nThe BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they\naudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his\nfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and\nthey reacted accordingly.\n\nWith respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates\nwas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that\nthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their\ninformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had\nmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been\ncompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to\nknock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for\nthus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,\nthen it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns\ndown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF\nbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the\nDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served\nwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A\nclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_\nhave shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was\nthe first shot fired!\n\nThe role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial\nposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the\nview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held\noff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI\nwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was\nbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the\npublic's sympathy.\n\nShould the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,\ndiverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents\nlike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,\nwell-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have\neven more tragic results.\n\n   - Lyn Bates\n     (bates@bbn.com)\n\nPS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston\nCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.

I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder\nafter about two blocks.\n\nI have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD\npadlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two\nfront spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a\npost in an underground parking garage.\n\nNext Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on\nme bike.\n\nWhen I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.\n\nBy the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links\nand encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of\nthem) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The\nguys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much\nand the inner tubes were free.\n\nLater.\n", "In-Reply-To: <20APR199312262902@rigel.tamu.edu> lmp8913@rigel.tamu.edu (PRESTON, LISA M)", "Need info on Circumcision, medical cons and pros\n\n\nI'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision\nof newborn males on the population.

It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.\nIt's got some error.\n\nOh well.\n\nBill Guilford", "Still no good.  WatchIT TV will not work on a with local bus video.\nIt will not work in any high reolution modes either.

If it's\nworking, you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it\nought to be different.\n\nSome folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams\nwin. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange\nthe batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong,\nfor the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS.\n\n\nIn the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on \"Majors\". In the NL,\nif I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and\nI'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because\nI've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without\nhesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).\n\nWilliams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't\nheadcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops\nto .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest\nBaseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.\nThat's not exactly chopped liver.\n\nMostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that\ncontinues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,\nsome folks would rather be right than be first.\n\n", "I believe that that would be the same as a system error #64.

The parts are\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\n\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n\n* What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?\n\n  Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always\n  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.\n  You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same\n  newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the\n  readers want to see.\n\n* Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?\n\n  No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were\n  created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be\n  patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many\n  sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,\n  comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of\n  people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your\n  postings in the right group.\n\n  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic\n  ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.\n\n* How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?\n\n  ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\n\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\n  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\n\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\n  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\n  introductory textbooks.\n\n  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\n  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\n  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\n  answered on your own.\n\n  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\n  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\n  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\n  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\n  in some areas.)\n\n  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\n  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\n  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\n  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\n  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\n  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\n  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\n  layer of complication and come back for another round.\n\n  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\n  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\n  of this FAQ.", "\n\n\n\nYes, long before Star Trek.

Azeri views on this dispute have\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\n\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\n\nThe following should be interesting. \n\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\n1991, page 28, we read:\n\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\n\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\n\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\n\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\n[AR] history of the conflict.\n\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\n \n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\n\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\n \n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\n \nIt's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the \nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\nplay dead. \n\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\n[AR] possessions?\n\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\n \n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\n\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\n \n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\n\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\nhave us believe.\n \n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\n\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\nclaim. \n\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \n\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\n\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\n\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\n\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\n\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\n\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\nwas stated as 11,000.\n\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\n\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \nMuslims in Karabakh!\n\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\nassuming no Kurds!\n\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\n\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\n  Republic.\n\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\n\n\t\t\t\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tN. Narimanov\n\n\t\t\t\tPeople's Commissar for Foreign Affairs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuseinov\"\n\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\n[AR] rule. \n\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\n\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\n\nNon-sequitur. \n \n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\n\nArmenian historians don't say this!\n\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\n\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \nargument totally invalid!\n\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\n\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\n\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\n\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\nArmenians.\n \n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the\n[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the\n[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.\n\nFine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian\nenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory\nis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local\npopulation! \n \n[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should\n[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as\n[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the\n[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can\n[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri\n[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.\n \nAzerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their\nown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are \nactions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war\nin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as\nan act of Allied aggression! \n \n[AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences\n[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of\n[AR] Columbia University in New York.\n\nHa!\n\n ", "\nThat figure (1/4\") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...\non my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12\").\n\n\nI can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are\nadjusted to \"factory-spec\" before leaving the central USA distribution point\n(MA) for the eastern Canadian market.

For nearly one thousand years, \nthe Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last \none hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation.

It is to those\nwho read with open mind, that I address myself.\n\n%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\n%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the\n%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member\n%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial\n%discrimination as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or\n%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic\n%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing\n%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of\n%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,\n%social, cultural or any other field of public life.\"\n\nWhile the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,\nas the text currently stands I know of no country in which\nracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.\nIt makes no mention of the need for for a legislative\nviolation.\n\n%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining\n%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The\n%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since\n%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli\n%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of\n%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United\n%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial\n%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.\n\nIf you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative\nstatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be\napplied to any other case where the council perceives some form\nof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.\n\nScarey thought.\n\n%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of\n%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native\n%non-Jews born in that country. \n\nActually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not\nalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be\ncorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes\napparent.  This slant permeates the text.\n\n%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas\n%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most\n%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the\n%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.\n\nThe above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting\nBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.\nYour own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the\nissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].\n\n%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim\n%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant\n%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).\n\nIf I recall correctly, at the time \"zionism\" took off, there\nwas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any\nfactual contradictory evidence .\n\n%But the\n%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and\n%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the\n%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native\n%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and\n%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could\n%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000\n%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.\n\nDo you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on \"most\nof their villages\"?\n\n%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to\n%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their\n%political repression and their destitution.\n\nThere is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later\nused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the\nintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was\nthat this was not the case.\n\nYou also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded\nthis.  As you do again, below.\n\n%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied\n%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus\n%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its\n%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered\n%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security\n%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and\n%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these\n%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.\n\nNot quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,\nthough it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.\nIsrael never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other\nannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.\n\n%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,\n%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of\n%international law and UN resolutions.\n\nOut of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,\nwhat int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories\ncaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country\npreviously (other than Iraq) ?\n\n%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under\n%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as\n%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a\n%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).\n\nIncorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against\non an \"ethnic or racial\" basis.  Therefore your above statement is\nincorrect.\n\nI also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,\nthe only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.\nHowever, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist\nat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not\nargue racial discrimination during that period!\n\n%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a\n%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that\n%represents them in world affairs.\n\nOnce again, some do, some don't.\n\n%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab\n%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant\n%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.\n\nAnother generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care\nabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you\nespouse.\n\n%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the\n%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject\n%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be\n%challenged in court.\n\nIncorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.\nFurthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all\nof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some\nare, but this is not due to the \"whims\" of the military as\nmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.\n\n%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied\n%territories are permitted to carry firearms.\n\nIncorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in\nDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of\nthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.\n\n%Jewish settlers have\n%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents\n%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel\n%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in\n%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will\n%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates\n%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish\n%settlement.\n\nThat is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your\npurpose is/was in posting this.\n\n%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them\n%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For\n%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected\n%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by\n%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish\n%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and\n%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to\n%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in\n%practice.\n\nOnce again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,\nright?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way\nyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but\nas a result of what actions?\n\n%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the\n%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are\n%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on\n%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these\n%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied\n%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in\n%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews\n%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government\n%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of\n%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;\n%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their\n%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and\n%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian\n%children are denied the right to learn their history and\n%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end\n%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the\n%authorities.\n\n1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.\n    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no\n    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish\n    collective.\n\n2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind\n    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has\n    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large\n    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case \n    in point.\n\n3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation\n    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously\n    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.\n    It is based upon Jordan's school system.\n\n4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another\n    gross generalization.  \n\n%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of\n%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never\n%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the\n%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its\n%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards\n%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is\n%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs\n%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately\n%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen\n%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of \n%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme\n%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in\n%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the\n%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.\n\nAnother generalization, but lets not stop here.\nThe transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,\nMoledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the\nterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,\nI recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered\npreviously.\n\n%Although sexual\n%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,\n%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal\n%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system\n%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.\n\nWhen was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,\nnor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious\nintervention is best answered by the proportional representation and\nthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.\n\n%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on\n%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has\n%not produced any written Constitution. \n\nSimply incorrect.\nThe answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the\ndynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your\ncontentions to the sidelines.\n\n%Zionism predicates a state\n%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,\n%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak\n%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli\n%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be\n%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial\n%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only\n%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the\n%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nBut the discrimination is not based upon race.\nOops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.\n\n%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that\n%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -\n%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed\n%to fail.\n\nReal world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.\nOf course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as\nyou are in your VIEW of things.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn's rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole\n    in the summer of 1993.

My definition\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\n\n\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\nunscientific.  \n\n\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n\"mainly about.\"\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation's Rhine.\n\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\neases one's defense.)\n\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me.\"\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\n\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\nSerdar Argic", "* Attention voters:\n*\n* I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.\n* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.\n* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.\n* (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\tThis is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation\n\tof four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)\n\t(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to\n\t     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)\n\t(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)\n\t(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)\n\t(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)\n\n\tThis is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n\tand comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to\n\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of\n\tthis post.\n\n\t1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:\n\n\t    If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \"yes\" after its name.\n\t    If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \"no\" after its name.\n\t    To abstain, leave a blank after its name.\n\n\t2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and\n\t    your first name (i.e. your personal name).\n\n\t3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the\n\t    ballot.\n\n\t4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm\n\t    (Central Time), April 24, 1993.\n\n\nBallot:\n\n----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----\n\n        (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:\n        (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:\n        (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:\n        (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n        (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:\n\n        (f)       voter's last, first name:\n\n        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24\n\n----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------\n\n\nExample Ballot #1:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John\n\n\tIn this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting\n\tto be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to\n\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of\n\tcomp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view\n\ton the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. \n\n\nExample Ballot #2:\n\n\t(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes\n\t(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes\n\t(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes\n\t(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes\n\t(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes\n\n\t(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane\n\n\tIn this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all\n\tthe proposals.\n\n\nVoting Rules:\n\n\t* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most\n\t  recent vote will be counted.\n\n\t* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,\n\t  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.\n\n\t* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings\n\t  will be revealed only after the poll closes.\n\n\t* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots\n\tas of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:\n\n                          bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu\nAiyagari, Sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu\nAlcorn, Justin

Born", "\n<clip clip>\n\n\nRunning MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the\nfollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified\nexplanation.\n\nTechnically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer\nadapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that\n\"Something's happening here, please take note.\" How the CPU is\nprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.\nIn MS-DOS, the \"interrupt vector\" is used to store the address of the\nfunction that handles each interrupt.\n\nNow, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready\nto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When\nDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,\nwait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to\nthe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's\nfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. \n\nWith any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing\napproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU\ncycles.) Hence, you can't \"share\" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're\nrunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.\n\nAnother issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses\ninterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what\nto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is\nrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is\nneeded.\n\nYou can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use\nthem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine\nis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came\nfrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.\n\nRemember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the\ngeneral picture correctly enough.\n\nCheers,\n", "\n\nOh no!

The\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\n\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\n\nSome personal thoughts:\n\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\nToday's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\n\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.

Almost every car I've ever owned has been\na 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I\n(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty\nhigh-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with\ntorque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the\nhighway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I \nprobably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been\naround 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the\n\"control\" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out\nto be very convenient.

But the car handles\nvery very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough\nsurface.\n\n\nDefinitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The\ncar has a \"much more expensive than it actually is\" look and feel to it.\n\n\nHaving driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension \"interesting\".\nThe car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm\nride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet\nthe car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.

I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \"sin\" on\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\n\n\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n\t    in the Inquisition.\n\n\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\n\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\n\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\n\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\n\n\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\n\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll\n\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\n\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\n\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\nsystem.\n\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n\nI think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads\nof) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?\n[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up\nthe origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th\ncentury onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the\ngospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]", "In rec.autos you write:\n\n\nThis McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it's only half auto,\nbut You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo,\nor whatever auto transmission.

Helsingius?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIDENTITY\n========\n\n_____\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\n\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\n\n_____\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\n\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\n\n_____\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\n\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\n  order that new users are added to the system.\n\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\n  computer receiving mail.\n\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\n\n  Common Suffixes\n  ---------------\n\n  .us    United States\n  .uk    United Kingdom\n  .ca    Canada\n  .fi    Finland\n  .au    Australia\n\n  .edu   university or college\n  .com   commercial organization\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\n  .gov   government\n  .mil   military site\n \n_____\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\n\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\n\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\n\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\n\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\n\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\n  \n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\n  \n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\n  \n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\n\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\n\n_____\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\n\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\n  individual.  \n  \n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\n    in the From: line.\n  \n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \n\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\n    hackers.\n    \n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\n  on the internet:\n\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\n  \n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\n  \n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \n  \n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\n    interpretations at different sites.\n  \n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\n\n_____\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\n\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\n  in privacy.\n\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\n\n\nPRIVACY\n=======\n\n_____\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\n\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\n\n_____\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\n\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\n  discourages its regulation.\n\n_____\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\n\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\n  \n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\n    possible.\n  \n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\n    prohibitive for casual use.\n\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\n    \n_____\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\n\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\n  without detection.\n\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\n  \n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\n  \n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\n  various reasons:\n  \n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\n    someone else. \n\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\n    many weeks. \n\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \n\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\n    ones.\n\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\n\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\n\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\n  - Make sure to logout always.\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\n  - Avoid password references in email.\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\n    considerate.\n\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \n  passwords.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\n\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\n \n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\n\n  Examples\n  --------\n\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\n\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.

In this case the `client' is the application\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\n  machine as the server.\n\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\n  Windows.\n\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\n  \n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \n  \n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \n\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\n  is extremely complex.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\n\n_____\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\n\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\n\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\n    such as a university. \n  \n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\n    tested legally.\n\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\n    other than the recipient.\n\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\n    overridden.\n\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\n\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\n  policies.''\n\n_____\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\n\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\n\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\n  unpopular opinions.)\n  \n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\n\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\n\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\n    files\n\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\n  guidelines:\n\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\n    communication.\n  - Use a disclaimer.\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\n    proprietary or `internal'.\n\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\n\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\n  ---\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\n\n  /pub/academic/cases\n  ---\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\n    description of the items in the directory.\n\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\n  ---\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\n\n_____\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\n\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \n  \n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\n    `passwd -f').\n   \n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \n    \n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\n    \n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\n    \n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\n    in your home directory.\n    \n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\n\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\n  below.\n\n______\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\n\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\n  extremely strict.\n\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\n  which can potentially be misused.\n\n______\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\n\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\n\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\n  \n______\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\n\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\n  the internet.\n  \n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\n\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\n  unstoppable.\n  \n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\n  years.\n\n\nANONYMITY\n=========\n\n_____\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\n\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \n  \n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\n\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\n\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\n  assurances of anonymity.\n\n_____\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\n\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\n\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\n\n_____\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\n\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\n  for the same person for different machine address email\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\n  mentioned above.\n\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\n\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\n  \n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\n    implemented yet.\n\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\n\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\n  \n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\n    that goes through them.\n\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \n\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\n    regarding it as illicit use. \n\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\n    server operator by the user.\n\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\n\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\n  before proceeding.\n\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\n  consequences can ensue.\n\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\n\n_____\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\n\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \n  \n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\n    return addresses. \n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\n    unaltered. \n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\n    to a remailer are common.\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\n    the use of passwords.\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\n  \n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\n  \n_____\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\n\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\n  \n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \n\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\n  be confined to the underground.

Take a nap.\nAlways a wise course of action when you're being gassed.\n\n\nI don't believe there was a \"suicide pact\".  I believe that Koresh\nwanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.\nIn fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories.\n\n\nYes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where\ndid they expect to go?\n\n\nThe building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost\nas bad as running into a fire.\n\n\nHm, an interesting notion.  We'll see.\n\n\nMore Bible study, no doubt.

On ground where no monument yet\n[DG] marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all\n[DG] races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a\n[DG] massive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false\n[DG] version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-American\n[DG] members of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise of\n[DG] tolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda\n[DG] campaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,\n[DG] in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.\n\n[JAKE] After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first\n[JAKE] impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.\n\nJake, I'm really disappointed in you.

There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for\nobjective and morality being a contradiction.\n \n \n \nFine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could\nname quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn't\nmentioned before). In other words, you have nothing to fulfill your strong\nclaims with.\n \n \n \nClutching a straw. I don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were\nloaded terms are fixpoints.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8\nbits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This\ncolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these\nmodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped\nto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a\n32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. \nHaving done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?\n\nApply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to\neach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range\n0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth\ncolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.\n\nYou could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how\nfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look\nrather odd.\n\nSo in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:\n\n\n\nIn other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.\nTacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.\n\nAs to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV.

Also I use\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she \nwon't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \nused offline files.  \n\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob's\n(Israel's) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel's Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings\" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.", "09 Apr 93, Jill Anne Daley writes to All:\n\n JAD> What exactly is a definition of sin and what are some examples.

In practice,\ncommunism has \"solved\" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_\nproductive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the\nrest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.

It was the game\nwhere Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,\ntwo-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans \nthrew the give-away \"fotoballs\" onto the field in response to the homer --\ntoo bad, huh?)\n\nWell, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it\nwas cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The\nwind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.\n\nAt most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on\nthe field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed\nmainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run\nout on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths\nthe infield) and grab the trash.\n\nIt might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given\nanything to be on the field with the ballplayers.

The compressed, encrypted audio stream\nis 13 kbits/s (!).\n\nMy Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days,\ncertainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity\n(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I\nran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember,\nthough, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can\ncertainly be improved.\n\nThe audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de,\nI believe (look for gsm or toast).

AIRPORT\n\n    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon\n    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI\n    interrogation.\n\nBy Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer\n\nSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the\nPhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law\nenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation\nLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police\nsaid Friday.\n\nThomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after\nthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday\nnight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard\nwas returning home.\n\nGerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday\nmorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count\neach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and\n$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police\nargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. \nA friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a\nsheriff's spokeswoman said.\n\nGerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,\nwith whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and \"wanted to have\nhis day in court,\" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and\none of two arresting officers.\n\nGerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from\n1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett\nsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to\ndisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he\nwas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.\n\nGerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network\noperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil\nrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave\ncriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said\nhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.\n\nInvestigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's\nhome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950\ngroups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized\nunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los\nAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.\n\nGerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,\nJames Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the\ninterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged\nsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any\ncriminal wrongdoing.\n\nBullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling\nintelligence to South Africa.\n\nADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent\ncontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal\nactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest\n\"has nothing to do with ADL.

His last assignment was on the gang task force.\n\nAfter FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement\nand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of\nManila.\n\nGerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines\nAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard\nafter his six-month hiatus, police said.\n\n\"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked\nlook on his face,\" Willett said.  \"Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'\"\n ", "It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the\nformatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the\ndisc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's\nmemory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible\nwith the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written\nIs that correct?", "   We don't disagree on this.

Andrew Byler)\n\n1] A english translation of this can be found in:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an\n   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance\", J. M. Wilson\n   (London, 1923).\n\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\n   reprinted 1970).\n\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if it\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\n\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\n\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\nearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)\n\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\nyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recension\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\n   Society, 1971).\n\nMetzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\n\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\n\n\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\n\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\n\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\n\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.", "\nI saw Messier and Leetch shooting at a camera on Letterman(?).

Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.", "\nFunny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no\nevidence ONE WAY or ANOTHER that there were bullet wounds --\nnot a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are\ndeemed speculative.

The keywords `Monthly Posting'\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\ndocumentation provided there.\n\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\n\nrec.autos.tech\n\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\n\nrec.autos.sport\n\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\n\nrec.autos.driving\n\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\n\nrec.autos.vw\n\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\na mailing list.\n\nrec.audio.car\n\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\nso is mentioned here.\n\nrec.autos.antique\n\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\n\nalt.hotrod\n\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\nperformance vehicles.\n\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\n\nalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\n\nalt.autos.karting\n\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\n\nrec.autos\n\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\n\n\nCrossposting:\n\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\n\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\n\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\n\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\n\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\nrec.autos.\n\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\n\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\nheaders, and on article content.\n\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\n\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\nspread of misinformation.\n\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\n\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\nto be supported in your area.\n\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\n\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\n\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\n\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\nquite useless.\n\n\nConcerning Lemons:\n\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all\n`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\nthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\ninformation.\n\n\nConcerning Flames:\n\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\nof this posting):\n\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a\nminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and\nyou'll get exactly what you deserve.\n\nIf you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\nbald, unsupported assertions.\n\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\n\n\nAsking the Question:\n\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\nsend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\nI'll summarize the results in a later posting.

And I still disagree with your \ncontention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \"scientific\" \ncan possibly know what's true and what's not.  \n\n\nOkay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\nhasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can't be of any interest to us.\"  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There've got to\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don't have any way of \nknowing that it's effective.\"  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of \nbooks and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I'm capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com", "I posted this once but didn't receive any responses.\n\nI've been looking for a good notebook for about $1700.

They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.\n\n\nWell, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources.

Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe\nand there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was\nstepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.\nGreat streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed \nCatherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in\npiercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword\nrepresented her suffering with Jesus.\n\nThe apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned\nthat a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition \nleading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets.\nAnd with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute\nwith the forces of the dark. She told Catherine \"The times are\nevil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be\noverturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all\nkinds.\"\n\nRefer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages.\nA copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores.\n\nI will post other Marian events every few days or so including\nthe ones happening today which are still under investigation.\nThese postings serve only to introduce you to these events.\nPlease look more into them and understand the reason for \nthe increasing number and urgency of these apparitions.\n\n-- ", "\nIf that's the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what\nthey profess is Christianity.

God's laws were originally written for \n: the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\n: all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\n: Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\n: obsolete by Jesus.\n\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\n: punishable.\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\n: and Gentile alike.\n\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\nchange that?\n\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\n\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\n\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\n\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\nmade the means look frightening.\n\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\nto debate with these people.\n\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\n\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\nthe will of God.\n\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\n\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\neternal damnation for non-believers?

Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich", "There has been some talk recently of Latin rites from the early Church used to\nbless same-sex unions.If anyone has any idea where copies of these rites\nexist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail.

From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n\nI don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n\nI understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\nconsciousness.  \n\n\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \n\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.

This was my point.\n\n\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.

There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\n\n\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.

The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.

So I\nthink they're onto something.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tHow cult psychology works...\n\t[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]\n\nSo long as Koresh could \"own\" his people, he made sure they didn't\nbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.\nOtherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians\nrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived\nonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.\nAbsolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they\nbelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even\nthe Red Cross asking them to come out.

If I believed it, I'd stay and die\ntoo, like the folks in Jonestown.\n\nFor a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife\n(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then\nthemselves.

He\nheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing\nwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!\n\nLook at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,\nat the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once\nJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his\nentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd\nbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought\nup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are\ntapes...  The \"logic\" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it\nwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people\nwho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by\nTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the\nsame with the Branch Davidians.\n(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER\nWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)\n\n...\nThe only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate\nreports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying\nfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the\noff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...\n\nSo, the only way the BATF/FBI could \"save\" those people, and future\ncults, is by ignoring such signs.\n\nI suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him\ninto letting them go, or somehow influencing \"his\" people to abandon\nhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.\n... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that\nwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe\nthey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's\ncertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.\n\n...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]\n\n    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from\nKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\n    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd\nwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning\nboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...

Our Lutheran parish just\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\n\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\nbut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\n \nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).

First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8\nbit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are\nsaying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those\nparts of the program that cause the problem!!\n\n\n\nNot sure what you are saying here.

XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\n\n\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\n\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\nhuman interface.

It makes no false claims.\n\n\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \nfar, you have not done so.\n\n\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it\nif it is so easy.\n\nOr alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.\n\n\nI think this is a bit of an exageration.\n\nWhat you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in\nthe states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up.

The\ndocument would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long\nterm human habitation in space.\n\nI believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to \nsucceed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld\n(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,\nchemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created\nto facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.\n\nSo, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective\nmethods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies\nwhich can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.

This is\na poor answer which you needn't rebut.\n\nI will now pull the old bait and switch.\n\nI think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God.\nBy that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what\nis described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on\nnow. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil\nand ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically,\nbut everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocide\nin the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now?\nTo move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people\nright now are suffering.

Right now there is a young mother\nwith three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through\nthe day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie.\nRight now there is an old man with no friends and no money to\nfix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't\nwe help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian\nwho doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.\n\nYou want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference,\nsomeone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times\nand has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask \nthe Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the \nwoman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful\nbusiness woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound\nbaby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might\ncall religious, but there will be something in common.\n\nGod is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is\nin those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give\nintellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're\nall wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart \nis a step in the right direction.

I've never quite understood\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\nat the same time, he is God's son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\nhe really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\nthen it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's \nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\ncase, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\nisn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\nincarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \n\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\nThe fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\n \n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\ngroup, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\nBirth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't\nimply that God's sperm was involved.

The\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\n\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\n\n\u00a5 Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\n\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\n\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\n\n\u00a5 Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\nManagement System.\n\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\n\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\n\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\n\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\npropulsion systems.\n\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\n\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\noperations costs, he said.\n\n\u00a5 Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\n\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\nattitude.\n\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\n\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\n\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\n\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\nmanagement options have been developed including:\n\n\u00a5 Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\ncommand.\n\n\u00a5 Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\nAdministrator.\n\n\u00a5 Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\nhand-picked program office.\n\n\u00a5 Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\nelement of the current program.\n\n\u00a5 Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\n\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\n\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\nand ground operations.\n\nWhat's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\nbe held May 3.\n\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\n\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\ncarried on the schedule are:\n\nApril 26\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\n\nApril 27\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\n\nMay 3\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nMay 15\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nJune 7\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n", "A person sees the front of their home is strewn with garbage.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith\n(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced\nof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal\nrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those\nbeliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to\naccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the\nconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs\narise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God \nmust reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would \nhonestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone \nwho disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are \nrejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient \nfor them, or because they wish to spurn God.\n\nI would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one \nholds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is \nthat it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with\nGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas\nof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or \nrevealed that truth.  \n\n-- \ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu", "\nSo far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE\nof gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.

This was a\nheresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It\ngrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus\nare two different people who happened to be united in the same body\ntemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia\nand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes\nthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is\ncorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had\nonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the\northodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two\nenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect\nharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus\ncame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human\nwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to\noriginal sin.\nIt is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this\nconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but\nnot two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council\nin Constantinople I believe.\n\nAndy Byler", "  The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year.

", "\n\nThe argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\nto Luke 3:23\n\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\n   the son of Eli,\n\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\n\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\n\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \n\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\n\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\n\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\nMatthew\". \n\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\n\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\nline of descent from David, the king.", "ITEM: Sony ES-CDPX229\nCONDITION: mint\nAGE: 1 year old\nPRICE: $300\n\n\nITEM: Sony CDP 770\nCONDITION: excellent\nAGE: 2.5 years old\nPRICE: $250\n\nEverything comes with the original packaging and manuals.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\n\n\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\n\n...\n\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\nkill people.\n\n\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\n\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\nthe best.[3]\n\n\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\n\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\ngovernment.\"\n\t- T.

It is\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\n\n\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\n\n\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\n\t48700 deaths by auto\n\t11300 deaths by fall\n\t 5300 deaths by drowning\n\t 4800 deaths by fire\n\t 4400 deaths by poison\n\t 3200 deaths by food\n\t 1400 deaths by firearm\n\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

At the rate \nof the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.\n\nCONCLUSION\n==========\nFirearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over \nsixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.\n\n\n\n[1] = Year.\n[2] = Population.\n[3] = Accidental deaths.\n[4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.\n\n\n[1]   [2]          [3]    [4]       [1]   [2]          [3]    [4]   \n1932  124,840,000  3,000  24.03     1961  183,691,000  2,204  12.00\n1933  125,579,000  3,014  24.00     1962  186,538,000  2,092  11.21     \n1934  126,374,000  3,033  24.00     1963  189,242,000  2,263  11.96     \n1935  127,250,000  2,799  22.00     1964  191,889,000  2,275  11.86     \n1936  128,053,000  2,817  22.00     1965  194,303,000  2,344  12.06     \n1937  128,825,000  2,576  20.00     1966  196,560,000  2,558  13.01     \n1938  129,825,000  2,726  21.00     1967  198,712,000  2,896  14.57     \n1939  130,880,000  2,618  20.00     1968  200,706,000  2,394  11.93     \n1940  132,122,000  2,375  17.98     1969  202,677,000  2,309  11.39     \n1941  133,402,000  2,396  17.96     1970  204,879,000  2,406  11.74     \n1942  134,860,000  2,678  19.86     1971  207,661,000  2,360  11.36     \n1943  136,739,000  2,282  16.69     1972  209,896,000  2,442  11.63    \n1944  138,397,000  2,392  17.28     1973  211,909,000  2,618  12.35    \n1945  139,928,000  2,385  17.04     1974  213,854,000  2,613  12.22    \n1946  141,389,000  2,801  19.81     1975  215,854,000  2,380  11.03    \n1947  144,126,000  2,439  16.92     1976  218,035,000  2,059   9.44    \n1948  146,631,000  2,191  14.94     1977  220,239,000  1,982   9.00    \n1949  149,188,000  2,330  15.62     1978  222,585,000  1,806   8.11    \n1950  151,684,000  2,174  14.33     1979  225,055,000  2,004   8.90\n1951  154,287,000  2,247  14.56     1980  227,757,000  1,955   8.58    \n1952  156,954,000  2,210  14.08     1981  230,138,000  1,871   8.13\n1953  159,565,000  2,277  14.27     1982  232,520,000  1,756   7.55    \n1954  162,391,000  2,271  13.98     1983  234,799,000  1,695   7.22    \n1955  165,275,000  2,120  12.83     1984  237,001,000  1,668   7.04    \n1956  168,221,000  2,202  13.09     1985  239,279,000  1,649   6.89    \n1957  171,274,000  2,369  13.83     1986  241,613,000  1,600   6.62    \n1958  174,141,000  2,172  12.47     1987  243,915,000  1,400   5.74    \n1959  177,073,000  2,258  12.75           \n1960  180,671,000  2,334  12.92\n\nSources: \nU.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States, \nColonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition, Part 2, Washington, DC, 1975.\n\nU.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: \n1982-83.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\nyou're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\nfor the U.S.\n\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nI'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know\nit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\nshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\nspend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a\ndifferent culture.\n\n\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\nand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\ndoctors with budget strings.\n\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\n\nWith such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\n\ngld", "\n\nAccording to MacWeek of 2-22-93:\n\nThe Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra\n800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris\n610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted\nabove the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take\npictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit\ndigital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,\nthe camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,\nwith 256 gray levels, on the screen.\n\nUsers will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record\ndetail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit.

You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's\nEgyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British\nMasonry.

When he first started trying to \"evangelize\" me,\nhe told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a\n\"mystery\" religion.

The Babylonian divinity was also represented\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\n-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the\nson, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of\nFortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\ncelebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\nPlutarch, that 'Osiris was black'.......\"  Hislop\n\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\nrepented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)\n\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\ncow\".\n\nI'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\nMasonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.

When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won't be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten\nup by the center tax?)\"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all\ngo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal?

The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.\n  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or\n    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our\n    European friends.\n  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.\n  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring\n    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.\n  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,\n    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).\n  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale \n    or color on a Color monitor.)\n  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that\n    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)\n  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution\n    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).\n\n    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people\n    are encouraged to use in other programs.\n\n    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:\n        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z\n\n\nFrom the ghostscript README:\n\n*****************************************************\n* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *\n*****************************************************\n\n********\n******** An overview of Ghostscript ********\n********\n\nGhostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:\n\n        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very\nclosely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and\n\n        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that\nimplement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive\noperations in the Ghostscript language.\n\nThe Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely\nin C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.\nCurrently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform\nfamilies:\n\n        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible\n          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;\n\n        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,\n          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,\n          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;\n          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX\n          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;\n          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;\n\n        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;\n\n        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler\n          version 3.1 or later is required).\n\n\n(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)\n", "", ": Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business\n: or professional body in a position to establish a standard and\n: provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission\n: systems.\n: \n: RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of\n: a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.\n.......\n: Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,\n: would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.\n\n\nHear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\nestablish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad\nTempleton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\nenough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\nstandard, and it will become the \"market* standard as well. (There is\na lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\nmandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\n\n(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\nbe to make \"workalikes\" which meet the standard but which generate\nphony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see\nthese issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\n\nMeanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction.\nOften criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\ncomplaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\ngeneral issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\nourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere\nlicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\nwanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\nRSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\nwould make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.\nFor those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms\ncould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,\nit's a small price to pay.)\n\nStrong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of\nkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\nall done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\n*NOT* strong crypto!\n\nWhatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\npatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\ncomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\nthat I said \"potential\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming\nmonths).\n\nThe RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\nattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\ndeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\n\nI know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\nusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\nCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\nPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\nwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\nto the Clipper system.\n\nOf course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to\noutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\nterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\nif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\npornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\nfew criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox\nmode.)\n\nI suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had\nwith RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully\nlegal copy of \"MailSafe\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.\n\nRSA?, Jim?, are you listening?\n\n-Tim May\n\nP.S.

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\nthe book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\nlaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, \nurban-folklore style.\n\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't \nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\n\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\nlaw registry].\"\n\nBingo.  Exactly.  \n\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there's absolutely no reason to \nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \nherrings.\n\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \nto have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd \ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \nwouldn't he?\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it\non their own?\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd's motivation isn't a \nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\n\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\" -- so \nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.", "\nThanks again Andy.\n\nThe image is in pub/delta-clipper now.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  \nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \nstandoff ensued.  \n\t     \n\t     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \ninsane.      \n\n\t     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \nagents against the compound.  \n\t     \n\t     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  \nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\n\t     \n\t     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \nimplementation of the decision.  \n\t     \n\t     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  \nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\n\t     \n\t     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \ndone differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\n\t     \n\t     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \ncircumstances.  \n\t     \n\t     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \nhas been learned now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \nafter 51 days, you decided --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \nwith --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \nfirst and then the other.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \ncan't do it at once.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  \n\t     \n\t     I was further told that under no circumstances would our \npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  \nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\n\t     \n\t     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \nI was given were the following:\n\t     \n\t     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \nneeded in other parts of the country.\n\t     \n\t     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \nmembers to come out.  \n\t     \n\t     Number three, that the danger of their doing something \nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \nthe passage of time.\n\t     \n\t     And number four, that they had reason to believe that \nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused \nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \nunsafe conditions.\n\t     \n\t     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  \nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \nincrease with the passage of time.\n\t     \n\t     The third question I asked was, has the military been \nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \nsignificance.\n\t     \n\t     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \ntoday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you address the widespread perception --\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \nto unfold.  \n\t     \n\t     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  \nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \nhappen when the federal government is in control.\n\t     \n\t     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \nchildren.  \n\t     \n\t     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \ndecide that way?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have \nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \nevidence we have.  \n\t     \n\t     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, were there any other options \npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \njust began to spin downward.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with \nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  \nThat's what they thought.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the government know that the children did not \nhave gas masks?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \nyou in agreement with that?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \ncountry.\n\t     \n\t     Go ahead, Sarah.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The \nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not \nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance \nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was \nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived \nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't \nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their \nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had \nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What federal laws --\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't \nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the \nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they \nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but \nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of \nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of \nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were \nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that \nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have \nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  \n\t     \n\t     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground \ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be \nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if \nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane \nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace \nwhere they could be protected.  \n\t     \n\t     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned \nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas \nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks \nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they \nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a \nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked \nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you \nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your \nmind during those horrendous moments?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had \nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the \npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that \nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues \nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would \nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in \nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were \nright or wrong, of course, we will never know. \n\t     \n\t     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the \nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate \nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were \nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  \nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a \nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't \nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't \ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I \ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I \nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to \nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had \nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, \nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. \nAnd I do support her.  \n\t     \n\t     She is not ultimately responsible to the American \npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an \nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as \nwell as she could have.  \n\t     \n\t     Thank you.  (Applause.)", ": Recently an e-mail to me mentioned:\n\n: (Technically, the messengers aren't even human so\n: it *can't* be a case of \"homosexuality\" -- even of rape.) [...]\n\n: The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of\n: the Sodomites' \"lust\" for the \"other flesh\" of angels.  Again,\n: application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of\n: gay Christians is largeely specious.\n: ***\n: Are angels \"flesh\"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because\n: of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).\n\n: what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse  \n: at all.\n\nBo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points\nout that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing\nthe elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those\nwho were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension,\nGod); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:\n\n\t\"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament,\n\trefer to idolatry, while \"flesh\" (as in I Pet 1:24) \n\tdenotes human society and its violent attempts at self-\n\texaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders\n\tof apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to\n\ttheir followers.\" [p. 199]\n\n\nThere is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring\nto actual sexual lust for \"alien flesh\".  Nor is it inherently necessary\nto understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular\nreasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin\nof homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and\nnot merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 \"This was the guilt of your sister\nSodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease,\nbit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable\nthings before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.\n\nFor the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's\nsuggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality\nis because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.

I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\nfall, though.\n\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\n\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\n\n\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"created\nin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\n\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\n\n\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:", "I have a few reprints left of chapters from my book \"Visions of the             \nFuture\".

Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"", "I was watching the Detroit-Minnesota game last night and thought I saw an\noctopus on the ice after Ysebaert scored to tie the game at two.

Another Clayton wannabe.  Typical response: lack of logic.\n\nDefine 'deviant':  someone who deviates from the normal.  Ok, so far.\nDefine 'normal':   erm, umm.  If you define yourself as normal then it is for\nyou to prove that you are (within limits, which then brings in the question,\nwhat are the limits?  For you we may have to broaden them to other's intolerance\n;-) ) 'normal'.  Difficult to prove.  From what you have posted it must follow\nthat `normal` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice.\nBut it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic, doesn't it?\n\n\nAgain an astounding lack of logic!  Wow!\n\nYou must define what you say such that everyone agrees.  Here you have used\nthe phrase \"sexual deviant\".  How in the hell do you define that?  As someone\nwho does something sexually that _you_ don't?  By this definition you most\nprobably mean the majority of the planet.  How do you know that your next\ndoor neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then\nhave it licked off by his wife?  Is this sexual deviancy?  How do we know\nthat you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive?  Is \nhaving sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy?  Please be more specific, and\nwhere you do, back up your claims.  Or I may have to go to hospital due to\nlaughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings.\n\nSecondly, if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means\nsuch people as homosexuals, bisexuals &c. (basically everyone you don't like),\nI think that your phrase \"do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`\" (why the\nbrackets?) is a non-sequiteur.  Gay groups exist which lobby their governments.\nThat is a fact.  Prove it false.  Hence they are a politial group.  You \nstate that they are not a political minority.  Are they therefore a\npolitical majority?  I think you boobed really big on this one.  Try thinking\nabout your arguments.\n\n\nProve the first statement please.   Dates, phone numbers, &c.\n\nAgain your logic fails.  Again you make statements which you cannot\n(and most probably will not) maintain.\n\nYou state that a person (girl, in this context) who considers equal rights\nfor all humans to be an airhead?  As Clayton (your best mate?) would say:\nit just shows how screwed up you are.\n\n \n\nProof please.  Proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order.\nProof that nature has always asserted itself.  Are you saying that nature\nis a conciousness?  Are you pretending that you have the ability to see the\nfuture?  Are you god(tm)?  In fact, by your arguement, are you waiting for \nthe black people to become slaves again?  Because they were reviled as\nsub-human (nb: *not* my view) at one time?  Again your arguement falls\non its ass.\n\n\n\nTouchy touchy touchy!\n\nRight.  I have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements.  You are\nmost probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers\nto my questions and challenges.  Since you cannot support your arguments it\nmerely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices,\nand cannot be taken to be fact of any kind.\n\nI await an intelligent response.....\n\n\n", "  On the contrary, the entire Clipper proposal is an example of the\ngovernment servicing the people (in the sense of the term found in the\nsentence, \"The farmer paid $100 to rent a bull to service his cows.\")\n\n\n", "Archive-name: jpeg-faq\nLast-modified: 2 May 1993\n\nThis FAQ article discusses JPEG image compression.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.

P. A1.\n \n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\n 12,000 people.\n \n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\n right-wing and what they called \"pinko\" organizations.\n \n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\n any laws.\n \n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\n Angeles and San Francisco.\n \n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\n \n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\n is based in South Africa.\n \n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\n \n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\n the search warrant.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\n be reached for comment, his office said.\n \n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\n \n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,\n San Francisco police alleged that \"ADL employees were apparently less\n than truthful\" in providing information during an earlier search\n conducted without a warrant.\n \n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\n the organization has not violated the law.  \"There is nothing\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\" he said.  \"Our\n record speaks for itself.\"\n \n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\n fund used to pay for \"fact-finding operations.\"  Lehrer, according to\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\n Patterson.\n \n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\n \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\n under surveillance.\n \n \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\n \"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a\n threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\n say, 'Pinko.'\"\n \n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\n \n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\n photographs.\n \n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\n \n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\n nature of the spy operation.\n \n The file notes that Kraft's articles \"appear frequently in The Times\n and are well researched and written,\" but little else about the file\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\n Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal\n information.\n \n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\n own paid informants under code names such as \"Scott\" and \"Scumbag.\"\n \n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n \n It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\n \n \n \n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.

Paddock, Times staff writer.\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\n police information on citizens and groups.\n \n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\n violations and conspiracy.\n \n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\n spectrum.\n \n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\n files on political figures.\n \n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\n deciding what charges to file.\n \n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\n Foxman described the ADL as \"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\n years.\"\n \n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\n information illegally, he said.\n \n \"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\n identity of any source of information,\" Foxman said.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \"a private\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\"\n \n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\n \n \"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\n distanced from ADL,\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\n \n Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\n \n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\n \n \"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\"\n the district attorney said.", "I think this didn't get posted before (I've been reading\nUSENET for the longest time, but never had much interest in posting\nuntil recently).

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only\nslightly better.\n\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\ndoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\n\nIn NYC I can recommend:\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \n\tSt. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\n\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\n\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\n\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen", "Oakland, California, Sunday, April 25th, 1:05 PM PDT:\n\nJose Mesa vs. Storm Davis.\n\nYou have been warned.\n", "\n\nNo matter how \"absurd\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\n\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\n\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\nwritten down by man.\n\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\nhave done).\n\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\nthink the important aspect is the result.\n\nDavid.\n\n---\nOn religion:", "Anyone here know if NCD is doing educational pricing on these software\npackages for those of us strapped for cash?\n\nThanks\n\n=eugene=\ns\n\n", "\ntoo bad he doesn't bring the ability to hit, pitch, field or run.", "I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or \neven gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and \nthe doctor administering it.
