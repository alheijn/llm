implying he would end the israel-hamas war in gaza and the israel-hezbollah war in lebanon - but has not  how. he has repeatedly  that, if he had been in power rather than joe biden, hamas would not have attacked israel because of his maximum pressure policy on iran, which funds the group. broadly, it likely trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the us out of the iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against iran and kill gen qasem soleimani - iran most powerful military commander. in the white house, trump enacted strongly pro-israel policies, naming jerusalem as israel capital and moving the us embassy there from tel aviv - a move which energised trump christian evangelical base, a core republican voter group. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called trump the best friend that israel has ever had in the white house. but critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. the palestinians boycotted the trump administration, because of washington abandonment of their claim to jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for palestinians. they were further isolated when trump brokered the so-called abraham accords, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between israel and several arab and muslim countries. they did so without israel having to accept a future independent palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.

no one can doubt israel determination to defend its people, helped enormously by the might of the united states. it is clear though, that the war has shown that nobody can fool themselves that palestinians will accept lives lived forever under an israeli military occupation, without proper civil rights, freedom of movement and independence.after generations of conflict israelis and palestinians are used to confronting each other. but they are also used to living alongside each other, however uncomfortably. when a ceasefire comes, and with a new generation of leaders, there will be chances to push again for peace.but that is a more distant future. the rest of the year and into 2025, with a new president in the white house, are uncertain and full of danger.for months after hamas attacked israel, the fear was that the war would spread, and get worse. slowly, and then very quickly, it happened, after israel devastating attacks on hezbollah and lebanon.it is too late to say the middle east is on the brink. israel is facing off against iran. the warring parties have plunged over it, and countries not yet directly involved are desperate not to be dragged over the edge.as i write israel has still not retaliated for iran ballistic missile attack on 1 october. it has indicated that it intends to inflict a severe punishment. president biden and his administration, israel constant supplier of weapons and diplomatic support, are trying to calibrate a response that might offer iran a way to stop the accelerating climb up the ladder of escalation, a phrase strategists use to describe the way wars speed from crisis to disaster.the proximity of the us elections, along with joe biden steadfast support for israel, despite his misgivings about the way it has been fighting, do not induce much optimism that the us will somehow finesse a way out.the signals from israel indicate that netanyahu, gallant, the generals of the idf and the intelligence agencies believe they have the upper hand. october 7th was a disaster for them. all the major security and military chiefs, except the prime minister, apologised and some resigned. they had not planned for a war with hamas. but planning for the war with hezbollah started after the last one ended in 2006 in a humiliating stalemate for israel. hezbollah has suffered blows from which it might never recover.so far israel victories are tactical. to get to a strategic victory it would need to coerce its enemies into changing their behaviour. hezbollah, even in its reduced state, is showing that it wants to fight on. taking on israeli infantry and tanks now that south lebanon has once more been invaded might negate some of israel advantages in air power and intelligence.if iran answers israel retaliation with another wave of ballistic missiles other countries might get pulled in. in iraq, iran client militias could attack american interests. two israeli soldiers were killed by a drone that came from iraq.saudi arabia is also looking on nervously. crown prince mohamed bin salman has made clear his view of the future. he would contemplate recognising israel, but only if the palestinians get a state in return and saudi arabia gets a security pact with the united states.joe biden role, simultaneously trying to restrain israel while supporting it with weapons, diplomacy and carrier strike groups, exposes the americans to getting involved in a wider war with iran. they don’t want that to happen, but biden has pledged that he will come to israel aid if it becomes necessary.israel assassination of hassan nasrallah, and the damage done to iran strategy and its axis of resistance is fostering a new set of illusions among some in israel and the united states. the dangerous idea is that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the middle east by force, imposing order and neutering israel enemies. joe biden – and his successor – should be wary of that.the last time that restructuring the middle east by force was contemplated seriously was after al-qaeda 9/11 attacks on america, when us president george w bush and tony blair, the uk prime minister, were getting ready to invade iraq in 2003.the invasion of iraq did not purge the middle east of violent extremism. it made matters worse.the priority for those who want to stop this war should be a ceasefire in gaza. it is the only chance to cool matters and to create a space for diplomacy. this year of war started in gaza. perhaps it can end there too.

david cameron has urged the uk to consider sanctioning two israeli ministers as a way of putting pressure on the country to act within international law. speaking to the 's today programme, the former conservative foreign secretary  before the election he had been working up plans to put sanctions on finance minister bezalel smotrich and national security minister itamar ben-gvir. he described the two men as extremist and  using sanctions would send a message to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that this is not good enough and has to stop. the  has contacted smotrich and ben-gvir for a response.lord cameron  both men had  things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the west bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out. earlier this year, smotrich suggested it might be justified and moral to starve gazans and has called for palestinian residents to leave and make way for israelis who could make the desert bloom. asked why the planned sanctions did not go ahead, lord cameron, who was foreign secretary between 2023 and 2024,  he had been advised that it would have been too much of a political act during the election. uk foreign secretary david lammy has condemned comments by the ben-gvir and smotrich as entirely unacceptable. speaking at a labour conference event, external last month, he : we are very worried about escalatory behaviour, about inflamed tensions. i’m absolutely clear, if we have to act, we will act. i’m in discussions with g7 partners, particularly european partners, on that. i’m not announcing further sanctions today but that is kept under close review. asked in parliament about sanctioning the be-gvir and smotrich, foreign office minister anneliese dodds  that the government kept its sanctions regime closely under review and would announce any changes.itamar ben-gvir (l) and bezalel smotrich (r) are part of netanyahu's right-wing coalition in the israeli parliamentwhitehall sources have  the  that lord cameron's plan to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on both men had been well advanced and ready to go. the imposition of sanctions requires a detailed and legally binding case which takes time to compile. but they  the decision was put on hold for fear of inflaming political tensions during campaigning for the general election. there were concerns about triggering violence in constituencies where views about the middle east were polarised. it is also understood the united states at the time opposed sanctioning  smotrich and ben-gvir. the uk tends to impose sanctions alongside us and the european union to maximise their impact. the foreign office never comments on or predicts future sanctions decisions; however, some sources  any decision on sanctioning the two israeli ministers might be delayed until after the us election. they also  that with such little uk leverage over israel, domestic political factors may play a bigger part in any decision. labour has already restricted uk arms sales to israel, refunded the un agency helping palestinians, and lifted opposition to the international criminal court having the right to seek an arrest warrant for netanyahu.another decision against the israeli government might be seen as one step too far. the sources also  there was the risk uk sanctions could be seen as a badge of honour by the two ministers. tom keatinge, from the royal united services institute think tank,  the  that putting sanctions on ben-gvir and smotrich would be a significant move aimed at sending a major political message to israel. he also  there was not a precedent for the uk government sanctioning elements of an ally country. he added that there were practical issues as sanctions required a lot of work and that the foreign office's sanctions director was already heavily overworked due to issues related to russia. on tuesday, the foreign office announced new sanctions targeted at illegal settler outposts and four organisations it  had supported and sponsored violence against communities in the west bank. the three settler outposts hit by the financial restrictions are tirzah valley farm outpost, meitarim outpost, and shuvi eretz outpost. the four organisations targeted are od yosef chai yeshiva, a religious school; hashomer yosh, a non-governmental organisation that provides volunteers for illegal outposts; torat lechima, an israeli charity and amana, a construction company that has overseen the establishment of outposts. the announcement follows previous sanctions announced in february, external and may., external the foreign secretary  the measures would help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights.lord cameron argued the uk government should seek to influence israel by putting restrictions on some of its ministers instead of pursuing the wrong path of suspending arms exports. last month, the uk government restricted arms sales to israel saying there was a clear risk the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. but lord cameron  restricting arms sales to israel while simultaneously helping to protect the country from iranian attacks made no sense. the former pm  everyone wanted to see the conflict end, but end in a sustainable way. he  israel had faced attacks from hamas in the south and hezbollah in the north and it was right to back the country's right to self-defence. but it is not a blank cheque, it is not unconditional, he . we do want to make sure aid gets through into gaza, we do want to see the role of the un in lebanon to be respected.

trump ally  ukraine focus must be peace, not territorytrump has consistently  his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on us resourcesa former adviser to president-elect donald trump  the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by russia. bryan lanza, who worked on trump's 2024 presidential campaign,  the  the incoming administration would ask ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky for his version of a realistic vision for peace. and if president zelensky comes to the table and , well we can only have peace if we have crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious, he . crimea is gone. a spokesperson for trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying  lanza does not speak for him.russia annexed the crimean peninsula in 2014. eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's east. the president-elect has consistently  his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on us resources, in the form of military aid to ukraine. but he has yet to divulge how he intends to do so - and will likely be hearing competing visions for ukraine's future from his various advisers.  lanza, a trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern ukraine, but he  regaining crimea from russia was unrealistic and not the goal of the united states. when zelensky  we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once crimea is returned, we've got news for president zelensky: crimea is gone, he  the  world service weekend programme. and if that is your priority of getting crimea back and having american soldiers fight to get crimea back, you're on your own. the us has never deployed american soldiers to fight in ukraine, nor has kyiv requested american troops fight on its behalf. ukraine has only requested american military aid to arm its own soldiers.  lanza  he had tremendous respect for the ukrainian people, whose hearts are made of lions. but he  the us priority was peace and to stop the killing. what we're going to say to ukraine is, you know what you see? what do you see as a realistic vision for peace. it's not a vision for winning, but it's a vision for peace. and let's start having the honest conversation, he . in response, zelensky's adviser dmytro lytvyn characterised  lanza's remarks as placing the pressure for peace on ukraine when it was putin who wants more war. putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front. what does this indicate? it is obvious that he wants to fight on, he . ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals. and it is russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of russian strikes. a spokesperson for trump's transition team - which prepares the incoming administration for office -   lanza was a contractor for the campaign, but does not work for president trump and does not speak for him. trump is expected to handle peace talks with a close circle of aides once in office. an unnamed national security council aide who previously served under trump  the wall street journal on wednesday: anyone - no matter how senior in trump circle - who claims to have a different view or more detailed window into his plans on ukraine simply doesn’t know what he or she is talking about. they  that the former president makes his own calls on national security issues and had done so many times in the moment. trump spoke to zelensky after his election win, with billionaire elon musk also taking part in the call.zelensky and trump after a meeting in the us earlier this year - they spoke on the phone on wednesdaya source in ukraine's presidential office  the  that the good lengthy conversation between zelensky and trump lasted about half an hour. it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things, but overall it was very warm and pleasant. trump's democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to russian president vladimir putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for ukraine that will endanger all of europe. the prime minister of estonia  the  that if ukraine backs down from the conflict, russia appetite will only grow. kristen michal  sunday with laura kuenssberg: the question probably is that if you start giving up, then you should be prepared to give more. for russia it quite understandable that if you draw a line somewhere and use the force to back it up, they will back up too, but not by politeness, that not the plan.last month, zelensky presented a victory plan to the ukrainian parliament that included a refusal to cede ukraine territories and sovereignty. during his election campaign, trump repeatedly  he could end the war between russia and ukraine in a day, but never gave further details. a paper written by two of his former national security chiefs in may  the us should continue supplying weapons, but make the support conditional on kyiv entering peace talks with russia. ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from russian occupation, the paper , but it should negotiate based on current front lines. earlier this week, putin congratulated trump on his election victory and  trump's claim that he can help end the war in ukraine deserves attention at least.  lanza also criticised the support the biden-harris administration and european countries have given to ukraine since russia's full-scale invasion in february 2022. the reality on the ground is [that] the european nation states and president biden did not give ukraine the ability and the arms to win this war at the very beginning and failed to lift the restrictions for ukraine to win, he . earlier this year, the us house of representatives approved a $61bn (£49bn) package in military aid for ukraine to help combat russia's invasion. the us has been the biggest arms supplier to ukraine - between february 2022 and the end of june 2024, it delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $55.5bn (£41.5bn),  the kiel institute for the world economy, a german research organisation. clarification: this article has been amended to reflect that bryan lanza stopped working as an adviser to the trump campaign after the election.

whose journalists were also sharing the house - showed a bombed-out building with a collapsed roof and floors covered in rubble. a vehicle used for tv broadcasts was overturned on its side, its satellite dish mangled with cabling nearby. all official parties were  that this house was being used as a stay-house for journalists. we coordinated with them all, an al-jadeed journalist, caked in concrete dust,  in a live broadcast while panting and coughing. lebanese journalists covering the conflict in the south of the country had to relocate from nearby marj'youn to hasbaya, as the former became too dangerous. in a statement hours after the incident, israel defense forces (idf)  they had struck a hezbollah military structure in hasbaya from where terrorists were operating. the incident showed that proximity to terrorist infrastructure poses a danger, the force . it added: several hours after the strike, reports were received that journalists had been hit during the strike. the incident is under review.youmna fawwaz, a reporter for broadcaster mtv lebanon,  the  that journalists in the compound were awoken at around 03:00 local time (01:00 bst) by the strike. she  ceilings had fallen in on them, and they were surrounded by rubble and dust, with the sound of fighter jets overhead. each news organisation had their own building in the compound, she , and the building housing the al mayadeen reporters was obliterated while al-manar employees were inside. ms fawwaz  it was a media compound known as such to both israel and hezbollah. the airstrike was carried out on purpose. everyone knew we were there. all the cars were labelled as press and tv. there wasn't even a warning given to us. she added: they are trying to terrorise us just like they do in gaza. israelis are trying to prevent us from covering the story. lebanon's information minister accused israel of intentionally targeting journalists, in contravention of international law. the israeli enemy waited for the journalists' nighttime break to betray them in their sleep, ziad makary wrote in a post on x. this is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with prior planning and design, as there were 18 journalists there representing seven media institutions.hasbaya, about five miles (eight kilometres) from the israeli border, is inhabited by muslims, christians, as well as people from the druze ethnic and religious minority. it has seen attacks on its peripheries in recent weeks, but this was the first strike on the settlement itself. the attack comes as part of an expanding conflict in lebanon, where israel has been intensifying air strikes for weeks - as well as launching a ground invasion on border towns and villages in the south. on friday un peacekeepers  they were forced to withdraw from an observation post in zahajra, in the south-west, after it was fired on by israeli forces earlier this week. unifil has accused israel of targeting its bases several times in recent weeks, causing injuries to peacekeepers. israel denies this and has blamed previous incidents on clashes with nearby hezbollah fighters. in the northern bekaa area, the israeli military has confirmed it attacked the jousieh border crossing between syria and lebanon overnight - which it  was being used by hezbollah and syrian security forces to smuggle weapons. lebanese authorities have recorded over 1,700 air strikes across the country in the past three weeks. hostilities broke out between israel and hezbollah on 8 october last year, the day after hamas's attack on israel that killed around 1,200 people. the iran-backed armed group has since been firing rockets and drones into israel in what it described as solidarity with palestinians in gaza. nearly 2,600 people in lebanon have been killed in the current conflict,  the country's health ministry - many of the deaths occurring since israel began escalating its attacks on 23 september. around 60,000 people in northern israel have been displaced by hezbollah rocket fire, and the israeli government has declared returning them to their homes to be a key objective. two people were killed on friday in a hezbollah rocket attack on majd al-krum, a town near karmiel in israel's north,  a statement, external from the country's foreign ministry. in southern lebanon, satellite imagery examined by the  shows israel's intensified bombing campaign has caused more damage to buildings in two weeks than occurred during a year of cross-border fighting. data shows that more than 3,600 buildings in lebanon appear to have been damaged or destroyed between 2 and 14 october - about 54% of the total damage. the attack on journalists in lebanon comes days after the israeli military accused six al jazeera journalists working in northern gaza of being affiliated with hamas or other armed palestinian groups. the qatari broadcaster  it denies and vehemently condemns the allegations.  the committee to protect journalists, at least 123 palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in gaza since israel launched a war in the territory last year. gaza's hamas-run health authority has  more than 42,000 people killed since. two israeli journalists have also been killed in the conflict.

the government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since labour won the general election. it is the week where farmers are heading for westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them. among those expected outside parliament on tuesday is the country most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, jeremy clarkson. guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.nearly three weeks on from the budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing. there is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected.  verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers. but beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers’ perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors. indeed, speaking on the westminster hour on  radio 4, baroness mallalieu, a labour peer and the president of the countryside alliance,  the government changes to inheritance tax relief smell of incompetence and that a large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community. two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from sir keir starmer down that they are not going to change their minds. and secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows labour had with many in rural britain the last time it was in power. twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central london to highlight the needs of rural communities. the initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting. as farmers head for westminster, the prime minister has been heading for south america - he is at the g20 summit of the world biggest economies in brazil for the next few days. but the issue followed him into the skies of the south atlantic, where he  he was absolutely confident that the vast majority of farms and farmers would not be affected by the changes. it's important for us to keep communicating how that works he . the truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the budget. i asked sir keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.sir keir starmer  supporting farmers is very importantasked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, sir keir  it's very important that we support farmers. he then made an argument we can expect to hear the environment secretary steve reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside. we’ve put £5bn in the budget for the next two years into farming. that is not to be overlooked. that is the single biggest sum of money in a budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming. on top of that, there £50m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and £200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating. bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the uk left the european union. incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in england as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas. it shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don’t handle this well. so why has this row become so noisy so quickly? from the conversations i have had, i think there are three main reasons.firstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it. the house of commons library, citing opinion polling, has described it as the most unpopular tax in the uk, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21. some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed. for others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone. secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by the economist magazine: never pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children book. trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes. think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food. thirdly, i am  it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context. it is the straw that has broken the camel back, is how one farming source put it to me. there was the new trade deal with australia, which many farmers think undermines them. there are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after brexit. and there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. there have been five farming ministers in the last five years. put them all together and there is a disillusion and a widespread sense among farmers of not being listened to. westminster is certain to hear them this week.sign up for our politics essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the uk and stay up to speed with the big moments. it’ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

what happens to trump convictions and legal cases after election win?trump is the first person with a felony conviction to serve as presidentdonald trump will be the first president to take office while several criminal cases against him are pending. his ascent to the highest office in the us while facing dozens of criminal charges has left the country in uncharted territory. many of his legal problems will go away when he steps into the white house. discussions already have started between trump's team and the office overseeing federal cases about how to wind those down,  the 's us news partner cbs. here's a look at what could happen with each of the four legal challenges he faces.donald trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in may in new york. a jury of new yorkers found him guilty of all counts in connection with a hush-money payment made to an adult film star. judge juan merchan pushed back trump's sentencing from september to 26 november, after the election. he could still go forward with the sentencing as planned despite trump's win,  former brooklyn prosecutor julie rendelman. but legal experts  it is unlikely that trump would be sentenced to prison as an older, first-time offender. if he was, his lawyers would appeal the sentence immediately, arguing that jail time would prevent him from conducting official duties and that he should remain free pending the appeal, ms rendelman . the appellate process in that scenario could go on for years, she .special counsel jack smith filed criminal charges against trump last year over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to joe biden. the case has been in legal limbo since the supreme court ruled this summer that trump was partially immune from criminal prosecution over official acts committed while in office. smith has since refiled his case, arguing trump's attempts to overturn the election were not related to his official duties. this is one of the cases which could be wound down under current discussions.as president-elect, trump's criminal problems from the case now go away,  former federal prosecutor neama rahmani. it's well established that a sitting president can't be prosecuted, so the election fraud case in dc district court will be dismissed, he .  rahmani  that if smith refuses to dismiss the case, trump can simply get rid of him, as he has pledged to do already. i would fire him within two seconds, trump  during a radio interview in october.smith also is leading a case against trump over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the white house, charges trump denies. he is accused of storing sensitive documents in his mar-a-lago home and obstructing justice department efforts to retrieve the files. the judge assigned to the case, trump-appointee aileen cannon, dismissed the charges in july, arguing smith was improperly appointed by the justice department to lead the case. smith appealed the ruling, but with trump set to take office, talks are now underway about ending the case.  rahmani  he expects the classified documents case will meet the same fate as the election case. the doj will abandon its eleventh circuit appeal of the dismissal of the classified documents case, he .trump is also facing criminal charges in georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state. that case has faced a number of hurdles, including efforts to disqualify district attorney fani willis over her relationship with a lawyer she hired to work on the case. an appeals court is in the process of weighing whether willis should be allowed to stay on the case. but now that trump is the next president, the case could face even more delays, or possibly dismissal. it is expected to be paused during trump's time in office,  legal experts. trump's lawyer steve sadow  as much when asked by the judge if trump could still stand trial if elected. the answer to that is i believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the united states, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office, he .in theory, yes. a president has never pardoned himself before, so the move would be unprecedented. but presidential pardons only apply to federal cases. trump has only been convicted of 34 state felony charges, so he would not be able to pardon himself in the new york hush-money case.north america correspondent anthony zurcher makes sense of the race for the white house in his twice-weekly us election unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here.

russian cash-for-votes flows into moldova as nation heads to pollsilan shor - pictured here while running for election in 2019 - fled the country before being sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlementthe sniffer dogs at chisinau airport have been working extra hard in recent months, searching for money that might be evidence of russian meddling in moldovan politics. ami, a black retriever, gives every suitcase that rolls in on the baggage claim belts a good sniff on all sides. if she detects cash, she will freeze. back in may she was doing that a lot. that is when customs officers began finding large amounts of money on passengers arriving via connecting flights from moscow. people who had never left moldova before were returning from a few days in russia with wads of notes. almost everyone had money: 2,000, 3,000, 7,000 euros, the head of customs at chisinau airport, ruslan alexandrov, remembers. the amounts themselves were not illegal but the patterns were suspicious. there were certain flights: moscow-istanbul-chisinau, moscow-yerevan-chisinau, the customs chief explains. normally people don’t come in with that much money. not from moscow.so police and prosecutors began seizing the cash. in one day alone they say they scooped $1.5m (£1.2m). no-one ever asked for their money back. the authorities believe the cash mules were part of a major and ongoing operation to buy political influence run by a fugitive moldovan oligarch named ilan shor. convicted of major fraud in chisinau, he is now resident in russia which will not extradite him. ahead of two key votes this weekend, the capital airport is on alert. flights from all high risk routes are met by sniffer dogs and at least half the passengers are pulled over for extra baggage scans.• none explained: decision time for two countries on future role in europe on sunday, president maia sandu is running for re-election on a staunchly pro-eu platform, challenged by 10 other candidates. many are openly sympathetic to moscow; some see moldova as a bridge. voters will also get to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether to enshrine moldova goal of eu accession in the constitution. in fact, membership talks have already begun but the country has been in a battle over its political direction for decades, ever since moldova gained independence from moscow as the soviet union fell apart. that east-west tug has intensified since russia full-scale invasion of ukraine. president sandu – a former world bank economist first elected on a promise to clean up corruption – then steered moldova much more sharply towards the west. she began to openly identify vladimir putin russia as a major security threat. the kremlin denies playing any role in chisinau politics, but officials here accuse russia of operating via proxies to disrupt and destabilise the country.president maia sandu (right) is running for re-electioni’m not aware of anywhere else where we’ve seen such a brazen and open attempt to corrupt an election, moldova chief anti-corruption prosecutor, veronica dragalin,  me this week in her office in chisinau. born in moldova, she spent most of her life in the us – most recently as a prosecutor in los angeles – before returning to the country and a job in a small office on the fifth floor of a soviet-era block with a broken lift. what her team say they have uncovered, working with police, is a pyramid payments scheme openly run from russia by ilan shor and his group. we’re talking about a foreign country sending money in an attempt to influence the election, ms dragalin spells it out. she details evidence gained through wiretaps, police infiltrators and witnesses – some of which her office has made public. at the start they tried to make it look legitimate. now it almost like they’re flagrantly flaunting all the laws… [and] openly influencing the decision to vote, the prosecutor . the primary goal is to have the referendum fail.  her team, once the cash couriers were detected at the airport and that route made more difficult, payments began to be channelled via a sanctioned russian bank, psb. by early october as many as 130,000 voters had received payment through this scheme - about 10% of the active electorate,  viorel cernauteanu, the chief of police. in september alone, $15m (£12m) was transferred, he  me, explaining how they could trace funds and recipients because they gave personal data to open a bank account. offering money or goods in return for votes is a crime with a possible five-year jail sentence. last month, a new law made it an administrative offence to accept money, too. but in one of europe poorest countries it is not hard to find willing recipients of cash.moldovan investigators admit they cannot identify the source of funds paid into psb bank – whether it is russian state money, private capital or the cash ilan shor was convicted of stealing in moldova. but he himself is very open about his actions and aims. in a typical recent post on tiktok, shor called for a firm no to the eu. he then urged followers to choose the president i decide on, as someone i can work with. in return he promised monthly top-up payments of 5,000 moldovan lei to pensioners, or about £200. shor fled moldova in 2019 and was later sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement. last year, his party was banned and he is also under western sanctions, accused of malign influence campaigns for russia. media companies linked to him, telegram channels and various political groupings have all been blocked. but his message – anti-eu, sympathetic to moscow – still seeps through. some remain receptive to that, as well as the cash.deputy governor of gagauzia spoke openly of his scorn for the euthe deputy governor of gagauzia, a small autonomous region of southern moldova, also happens to respect russian president vladimir putin. he tells me that is because he likes strong leaders who he thinks put their country first. russia war on neighbouring ukraine changed nothing on that score. he admires former us president donald trump for the same reason, whilst his scorn for the eu – which recently placed him under sanctions for destabilising activities – mainly focuses on lgbt rights, which he opposes virulently. later, when i ask passers-by in the regional capital coat about the eu referendum, several reply that they’ll vote no in order to keep gay parades from their town.a sign for the pro-russian victory party in coat, gagauziapro-russian views and kremlin-led narratives have always been strong in gagauzia, where many still watch russian state tv channels despite a national ban. lately, shor has been investing heavily here. the deputy governor repeatedly refers to him as our political leader and shrugs off the criminal conviction as if it were political. try and say a bad word here about ilan shor and people will spit at you!, uzun declares as we drive down lenin street past a statue of the russian revolutionary, a little grubby but still intact. many shop signs, those not in the local gagauz language, are in russian. i hear how shor pays top-up pensions to 30,000 people in the region as well as re-tarmacking some 50 km (31 miles) of roads between remote villages, which we see. all he does is for the people, uzun enthuses.the anti-corruption prosecutor later clarifies that using donations for social spending is not a crime. but channelling shor funds to political parties is an offence – and uzun boss, regional governor evghenia gutul, has been charged with that. after a while we roll up to a children fairground. look at gagauziyaland, it beautiful! uzun beams, leading the way beneath a giant rainbow into a deserted but brand-new park.gagauziyaland, a children's playground, was almost deserted during our visitthe wind is bitterly cold and the mini dragon roller-coaster and merry-go-round we are looking at both stand empty and still. but uzun insists people in gagauzia will vote how shor tells them - not for money, but because they trust him. all the talk, that he an arm of the kremlin, destabilising moldova: that absolutely not true. this is the truth: what you see here, he waves towards the frozen fairground.women in traditional moldovan dress welcomed president maia sandu at a campaign event on fridayon friday, moldova election campaign reached its climax. maia sandu was met for her own final rally in the small town of telenesti, where women in traditional dress sang and supporters clapped as she passed. she has not taken part in election debates and did not want to speak to the . but addressing a couple of hundred people through a microphone, sandu urged moldovans to vote for her and for the eu as the best path to peace. this has been a very difficult campaign with a lot of lies and dirty money, she  them, asking voters to put our country out of harm way and prevent her opponents derailing moldova from its european path. that path has been a bumpy one for many years, with multiple diversions. still, moldova had already made its choice and opened accession talks with the eu. now a referendum that sandu initiated in an attempt to reinforce that goal and bolster her own support has turned into a risky political move. it looks like the presidential ballot is not the only vote she has to worry about on sunday.

workers could get right to strike for a yearthe government is considering giving workers twice as long to strike. under existing legislation, if workers vote to take industrial action, the mandate expires after six months and unions are required to hold another ballot to extend it. but a consultation document produced by the government  the mandate could be extended to a year. it  due to unions being very likely'' win a second ballot, keeping the six-month rule would ''add administrative costs'' to them.railway staff, train drivers, doctors and teachers are just some of the groups that have staged walk outs in recent times. the walk outs across different sectors and industries over the past couple of years have resulted in more than 5.7 million working days have been lost, the highest number for more than 30 years,  official figures. ministers argue that by making it easier for unions to organise, it would lead to a more co-operative relationship with employers and lessen the need for industrial action. the government is proposing to also abolish the requirement that 50% of a workforce turns out to vote. it is looking to get rid of the rule that for important public services such as the nhs, some 40% of the workforce must have voted in favour of industrial action for it to go ahead. the  has contacted the conservative party for comment over the proposals. deputy prime minister angela rayner,  the government's policies under the employment rights bill were aimed at repealing the anti-worker, anti-union laws, and turning the page on industrial relations. the employment rights bill is a major shake-up of workers' rights, but the reforms proposed are still being worked out and it is still unclear how some will work in practice. conservative shadow business secretary, kevin hollinrake, has urged the government to withdraw the employment rights bill and think again. he  the proposed legislation created existential crisis of a magnitude not seen since the pandemic for jobs and business people. the government's own analysis released earlier this week  labour's plans to upgrade workers' rights would cost businesses up to £5bn a year to implement.paul nowak, general secretary of the tuc,  the union welcomed the government's commitment to introduce a modern framework for industrial relations. under the bill, the government plans to make to easier for unions to be recognised by employers and companies. a main function of a union is to represent workers in negotiations with their employers over pay and working conditions. at present, 10% of a workforce must be union members for an application to be made to get recognition, but it has been proposed this could be lowered to 2%. under existing rules, 40% of a workforce must vote in favour of recognition, but under the government's new proposals, that threshold would be abolished. trade unions have argued that it is too easy for companies to employ extra employees to make it harder for them to reach the required thresholds to be recognised. in july, the gmb trade union lost a vote for recognition at the amazon fulfilment centre in coventry by 28 votes. the union accused the company of packing out the warehouse with surplus workers in an effort to thwart their bid for recognition. amazon denied doing so and  it recruited the workers as part of normal business planning.

almost £1bn in funding will go to delivering london-style buses across england as part of a massive budget boost, the government has promised. the department for transport (dft) has given more details on its plans for 2025 after announcing the funding last month. it has promised to deliver what it calls london-style services to every corner of the country, and  funding would be allocated based on levels of deprivation and population, instead of making areas compete for investment as it has in previous years. the dft  leicester, the isle of wight, torbay, southend, cambridgeshire and peterborough are set to receive unprecedented levels of funding.in urban areas, some of the biggest allocations are being given to combined authorities representing south yorkshire and the liverpool city region. in total, there will be £712m for local authorities to improve services, alongside a further £243m for bus operators. about 3.4 million people in england travel regularly by bus, making it the most commonly used mode of public transport. local authorities in all english regions will be able to introduce new bus routes, make services more frequent and protect crucial routes, the dft . it added the money will allow more urban areas to maintain high levels of service. meanwhile, rural communities and small towns will be able to offer more services. transport secretary louise haigh  the 's sunday with laura kuenssberg programme the funding would vastly improve the reliability and frequency of services, particularly in rural areas.the announcement comes ahead of the buses bill, which aims to give local transport authorities across england new powers to take control of bus services. under the plans, local authorities would be allowed to introduce a london-style franchising system, meaning they can decide routes, timetables and fares, with operators bidding to run the services for a fixed fee. the government has also pledged to remove a ban on publicly owned bus companies. an extra £151m will also fund a cap in single bus fares outside london, which rose to £3 last month, until the end of 2025. the liberal democrats have called for the government to u-turn on the decision to raise the cap, with the party saying it will hit both commuters and local businesses. lib dem leader sir ed davey  on friday: the fare cap increase is like a bus tax for people across the country, impacting bus users and commuters already struggling to make ends meet. mps must be given a say on this bus fare hike on behalf of their constituents. conservative shadow transport secretary gareth bacon : labour have chosen to increase bus fares by 50% in a further attack on rural communities, working people and pensioners. they didn’t have the courage to tell people their plans in the election. this is another broken promise that raises costs on working people. but the dft  the fare cap introduced by the previous conservative government was due to expire at the end of 2024 and some fares would have soared unless it intervened. fares will only be allowed to increase with inflation in the normal way, and the £3 bus fare cap will lead to savings of up to 80% on some routes, keeping bus tickets affordable across the country, it .• none more bus services could come under control of councils
