met faces service cuts without more cash,  chiefthe boss of the uk's largest police force has warned it faces eye-watering cuts to services unless ministers increase its funding. met commissioner sir mark rowley  the  he was deeply troubled by talks so far on its annual settlement for next year. he added that the force was in a precarious position because previously used options to prop up its budget were no longer available. the government has  it plans to increase the overall policing budget next year - although allocations by force are still to be negotiated.the met's budget for this year is just over £3.5bn, a 3.5% increase from 2023/24, comprising £2.6bn from central government and £956m from local taxes. sir mark  conversations over its funding allocation from next april - which would normally be expected to be announced in december or january - were still ongoing with the government and city hall. but, speaking to  radio 4's political thinking with nick robinson, he  he was deeply troubled by the situation we appear to be heading towards. policing a global capital such as london came with an extra set of challenges, he , adding that spending per person was lower than in other cities such as new york and sydney. he  that the cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so had put the force in a more and more precarious position, and some of its buildings would be unusable in a few years without further investment. some of the things that successive [police] commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out, he added. the chancellor has been very clear - it's a difficult public sector context.you add all those things together, and you get a dramatic change in budgets of a scale that's never going to be absorbed by efficiencies, and is going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to london. he added that he was not going to get into detail at this stage on the tough choices the force would face without an increase in resources. but he  he planned to specify 10 or 20 things we're going to do differently before christmas. he added that the implications for policing in the capital would become more public in the coming weeks. the budget for the home office is set to shrink by 3.3% next year in real terms, with the bulk of this coming from assumed savings on asylum support. at last month's budget, the government  it planned to increase the core government grant for police forces, although it did not specify whether this would be in cash terms or taking account of inflation. before the election, labour also  it also planned to save £360m through more efficient purchasing of police equipment, which it promised to spend on extra community support officers.sign up for our politics essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the uk and stay up to speed with the big moments. it’ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

new deals with balkan states to target people smugglersthe uk has signed new agreements with western balkan countries to tackle people-smuggling gangs, as part of efforts to bring down small boat crossings. the deals will increase intelligence sharing and cooperation with serbia, north macedonia and kosovo to intercept and arrest the gangs, with the aim of breaking their business models at source. the government  the region was a key route used by those who end up in the european union or uk illegally, with almost 100,000 migrants transiting through the western balkans last year. prime minister sir keir starmer announced the plans at a meeting of the european political community (epc) in hungarian capital budapest on thursday.more than 31,000 people have crossed the channel in small boats so far this year - more than the same period last year. the uk already has agreements with countries including albania and turkey to share intelligence to disrupt people-smuggling gangs. sir keir : there is a criminal empire operating on our continent, exacting a horrendous human toll and undermining our national security. he  the uk would be at the heart of the efforts to end the scourge of organised immigration crime but we cannot do it in isolation. he added: we need to go further and faster, alongside our international partners, and take the fight directly to the heart of these vile people smuggling networks. home secretary yvette cooper : working more closely with serbia, north macedonia and kosovo, we will share information and intelligence, and work across borders to map out what is happening and where, to break the business models of these unscrupulous gangs at source.it comes after the government announced an extra £75m funding for the uk's new border security command, which brings together police, intelligence and immigration enforcement agencies to tackle small boat crossings. graeme biggar, the national crime agency's (nca) director general,   radio 4's today programme that continuing to work with international partners was crucial. he added that it is very difficult to have exact confidence on how much measures would reduce the number of uk small boat crossings as so much depends on what's happening with the rest of the world. on tackling people-smuggling gangs,  biggar  that what is particularly hard for the nca is that the people themselves are not illegal, their presence in the uk or in some countries on the way here may be illegal, and often the tools that they are using to get here are not themselves illegal - boats and engines. so being able to prove a criminal conspiracy is quite hard, he added. the epc was set up in 2022 in response to russia's invasion of ukraine as a way of bringing together european heads of government for informal talks and improving cooperation. the group includes the 27 members of the eu as well as 20 other european countries.

alex salmond loved creating headlines. he would be disappointed if he gave an interview that was not sufficiently interesting to make the news. as a young radio journalist, i was sent to see him at a business breakfast event where at that time he was demanding the uk join the single european currency. when i suggested this was not new, that he’d  it many times before, he : yes but i’m saying it more forcefully now because the case is more urgent. anything to make his contribution count. spending time in his company could easily make you late. he tended not to limit interview duration and enjoyed further conversation, debate and showing off a bit after the microphones were off.i can remember interviewing him in his early days as first minister at his official residence, bute house in edinburgh. the interview was over and i needed to go - but he wanted to show me a collection of silverware that had been found in a cupboard, and share something of its history. while he could be charming and entertaining and always offered a sharp analysis of the politics of the day, there was also a less pleasant side to his character. i would wince when sometimes he would show impatience and irritation towards his staff. he could be very demanding of them. i can also remember bringing a senior  editor from the newsroom in london to see him, and was astonished when he asked my colleague if he was on a colonial visit.alex salmond and alistair darling took part in a debate chaired by glenn campbell ahead of the scottish independence referendum in 2014he had a love/hate relationship with the . he loved when he was offered a prestigious spot on a network show like question time, especially when his political career was in decline. at other times, he would rage against output he did not like. he was not happy that i interviewed, anonymously, one of the women who had accused him of sexual offences in court, after he had been acquitted of all charges. it was not an attempt to re-try the case but a response to his claims of a political conspiracy. i am not sure he forgave me for that. i travelled with him to europe, the united states and china. i remember him turning up uncharacteristically early at the forbidden city in beijing to meet china vice-premier and finding himself locked out. it would have made powerful tv footage but i don’t think we got it on camera. he thought we had captured this embarrassing moment and gave me a private briefing and a couple of scoops in the hope i wouldn’t use it.alex salmond lived and breathed politics and he seemed completely lost when he was ejected from parliament in 2017. i bumped into him in edinburgh soon after and we shared a taxi to waverley station. naturally we talked politics and when it came time to part he just kept the conversation going. in recent years, we talked far less. he refused to take part in a podcast series i made about nicola sturgeon time in office - which would obviously have included the spectacular rift between them. that was not like him. in all my previous experience, he rarely missed a media opportunity. better in his view to get out there and make his case rather than shy away and let others set the narrative.

fixing social care is urgent,  minister, after claims of impassereforming the social care system in england is urgent, cabinet minister louise haigh has , after sources  the  there was a genuine impasse at the top of government over the issue. the transport secretary  the government had already taken steps to improve pay and tackle vacancies in the sector, as well as giving councils an extra £600m in funding for adult and children's social care. in its election manifesto, labour promised to create a national care service to deliver consistent care across the country - but so far the party has given little detail on what this would look like.liberal democrat leader sir ed davey called for cross-party talks on how to reform the system in the long-term, but  there also needed to be immediate measures. the prime minister, health secretary and chancellor are due to meet in the next 10 days to discuss the issue. multiple sources have  the  the department of health is keen to proceed with an overhaul of the social care system but that the treasury is reluctant to commit to significant costs without clear political backing from number 10.it really urgent that we fix this issue, haigh . for too long we’ve let this problem fester. pressed over whether the government was taking the problem seriously, she  the 's sunday with laura kuenssberg programme that the health secretary had already set out a 10-year plan for the nhs which included focusing on prevention and community care, which she  would ease pressures on social care. she also pointed to the government's plans to improve pay and conditions in the sector through a fair pay agreement, allowing negotiations between workers, unions and employers. we need to make sure we are tackling those long-term issues in the workforce, with progression opportunities, properly paid and properly negotiated on a collective basis, she added.the adult social care system helps older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and eating, and covers support in people's own homes, as well as care homes. unlike the nhs, social care is means-tested and people are usually expected to contribute towards the cost. this means some people face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result. deborah crisp  the programme how three years ago her 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, had to sell her flat for just under £200,000 to pay for a care home - and that amount had already been used up. now that money has gone, she . the local authority say they cannot fund her to stay where she is and she will need to be moved somewhere else, and we feel that due to her multiple health issues it will be catastrophic for her to be moved elsewhere - and we really fear for her safety.ministers are considering whether to create a royal commission, with cross-party involvement, to look at how to reform the social care system, or a shorter government-backed independent review. sir ed  although the lib dems would back a royal commission there needed to be immediate measures first and it must not be an excuse for long-grassing this. he  there were things the government could do straight away, for example on tackling vacancies in the sector. the lib dem leader called on the government to be more ambitious, pointing to his party's own proposals for a higher minimum wage for care workers. politicians have been failing on this for far too long, he  the . there are millions of people suffering, families being hit financially, people in misery and pain, and we have got to tackle this. he added that the lib dems were willing and ready to take part in negotiations over the issue but he had not yet had a call from health secretary wes streeting to do so. conservative shadow home secretary chris philp accused the government of having no plan to tackle the issues with social care. he  the  the government decision to increase the rate of national insurance contributions paid by employers would also make it even more difficult for the care sector to operate. providers have warned these increased staffing costs could force some care homes to close.

Cluster 3:
Topic:  Northern Territory is the part of australia with the highest rate of incarceration . More than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, five times the national average . The region's new government has lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10 . Indigenous communities are by far the most affected by the new laws . Around 30% of the northern territory's population is aboriginal, so, aboriginal communities are affected .
Example texts: 'adult crime, adult time': row as australian territory locks up 10-year-olds againa protest was held outside the northern territory's parliament in darwin as mps debated lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10'thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison. following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in australia northern territory (nt). he was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary. five years on, the aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out. it hard changing, thomas tells me. [breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it hard to [stop] the habit. his story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the northern territory. for many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. the northern territory is the part of australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average, external. it also more than twice the rate of the us, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. but the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. the move, which defies a un recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.business owner sunil kumar  his restaurant had five or six break-ins in the last year and is in favour of tougher lawsit's not just an issue of incarceration. it's one of inequalities too. while around 30% of the northern territory's population is aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are indigenous. so, aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. the country liberal party (clp) government  it has a mandate after campaigning to keep territorians safe. it helped the party claim a landslide victory in august's elections. among those voting for the clp was sunil kumar. the owner of two indian restaurants in darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. it's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun, explains  kumar. he  he improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. how come they are out and parents don't know? he . there should be a punishment for the parents. but while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. youth offender rates have risen since covid. last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. but the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the northern territory, australian bureau of statistics figures show. politicians, though, are playing to residents’ fears. as well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as declan's law, after declan laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. i never want another family to experience what we have,  his mother samara laverty. the passing of this legislation is a turning point for the territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place.on the day the laws started to be debated in darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. one woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. another asked: 'what if it was your child?' our young people in don dale need to have opportunity for hope,  aboriginal elder, aunty barb nasir, addressing the demonstrators. she was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. we need to always stand for them because they are lost in there, aunty barb . kat mcnamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill,  the crowd: the idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt. after a ripple of applause, she added: we are not going to stand for it. but with a large majority in parliament, the clp easily managed to pass the laws.protesters opposing the new law argue that jailing 10-year-olds is not a sustainable long-term solutionlowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. and while other australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the australian capital territory. australia is not alone – in england and wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. but in comparison, the majority of european union members make it 14, in line with un recommendations. the northern territory's chief minister, lia finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can intervene early and address the root causes of crime. we have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time, she  last month. and we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more. but for people like thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. his crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. he  he finds prison oddly comforting. it's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. most of my family has been in and out of jail. i felt like i was at home because all the boys took care of me. his two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. at one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now – his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. he's been helped by brother 2 another - an aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports first nations children caught up in the justice system.darren damaso, from the program brother 2 another,  there should be more investment in services to support young aboriginal peoplelocking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,  darren damaso, a youth leader for brother 2 another. there needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. and then we're going to slowly start to see change. but if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work.  damaso is from the larrakia aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of darwin, and he also has connections to the yanuwa and malak malak people. his organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. brother 2 another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. it's a self-perpetuating cycle,  john lawrence, a scottish criminal barrister who's been based in darwin for more than three decades. he's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. aboriginal people have no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm,   lawrence. the fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.the tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the northern territory. in queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the liberal national party played heavily on its slogan: adult crime, adult time. in a recent report by the australian human rights commission, anne hollonds, the national children commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them first nations children - the country is creating one of australia's most urgent human rights challenges. the systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps, she . we cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer. which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. what are the cultural strengths of people? what are the community strengths of people? we are building on that,  erin reilly, a regional director for children's ground. her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the aboriginal 'kinship’ system - how people fit in with their community and family. we centre indigenous world views and indigenous values and we work in a way that works for aboriginal people, explains ms reilly. we know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people. for thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. but on the outside, he , there little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. i felt like no one cared. nobody wanted to listen, he . he points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: so, i hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?

what trump's win means for ukraine, middle east and chinadonald trump return to the white house is set to reshape us foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. during his campaign, trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it america first. his victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in washington approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. we can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.during the campaign, trump repeatedly  he could end the war between russia and ukraine in a day. when asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. a research paper written by two of trump former national security chiefs in may  the us should continue its weapons supply to ukraine, but make the support conditional on kyiv entering peace talks with russia. to entice russia, the west would promise to delay ukraine much-wanted entry into nato. the former advisers  ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. trump democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to russian president vladimir putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for ukraine and will endanger all of europe. he has consistently  his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on us resources.it not clear how far the former advisers’ paper represents trump own thinking, but it likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he’ll get. his america first approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the world war two, originally as a bulwark against the soviet union.nato now counts 32 countries and trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing europe of free-riding on america promise of protection. whether he would actually withdraw the us from nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance defence spending guidelines. but the reality is nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.as with ukraine, trump has promised to bring peace to the middle east - implying he would end the israel-hamas war in gaza and the israel-hezbollah war in lebanon - but has not  how. he has repeatedly  that, if he had been in power rather than joe biden, hamas would not have attacked israel because of his maximum pressure policy on iran, which funds the group. broadly, it likely trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the us out of the iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against iran and kill gen qasem soleimani - iran most powerful military commander. in the white house, trump enacted strongly pro-israel policies, naming jerusalem as israel capital and moving the us embassy there from tel aviv - a move which energised trump christian evangelical base, a core republican voter group. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called trump the best friend that israel has ever had in the white house. but critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. the palestinians boycotted the trump administration, because of washington abandonment of their claim to jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for palestinians. they were further isolated when trump brokered the so-called abraham accords, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between israel and several arab and muslim countries. they did so without israel having to accept a future independent palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.

further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.

melania trump is latest republican first lady to back abortionmelania trump seems to have joined a long line of republican former first ladies who have come out in support of abortion rights, putting them at odds with their husbands' public views. in a short video clip promoting her forthcoming book, s trump expressed her support for women's individual freedom, describing it as an essential right that all women possess from birth. it comes a day after an excerpt of her soon-to-be-released memoir, in which she ly takes an even clearer pro-choice stance, was published in a newspaper report. s trump's apparent stance on the issue appears to contrast with the position of her husband, who has taken credit for helping overturn roe v wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion.but it follows a decades-long american tradition of republican first ladies who - since roe v wade was first decided in 1973 - have  legal abortion access should be protected. in 1975, while still in the white house, first lady betty ford called the roe ruling a great, great decision. nancy reagan waited until her husband, president ronald reagan, left office before she  publicly that she believed in a woman's choice, but her position on the issue was ly well known within the white house. barbara bush, wife of president george hw bush, and her daughter-in-law, laura bush, wife of president george w bush, were similar, revealing their stance on the issue after their husbands left the white house. i think it's important that it remain legal, because i think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons, laura bush  in a 2010 interview promoting her memoir. in a black-and-white video posted on her x account on thursday, s trump  there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. what does my body, my choice really mean? s trump continued. the video comes one day after the guardian, external published an excerpt from her new book, melania, set to be released on 8 october. in the excerpt, quoted by the guardian, she writes: it is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government. why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? a woman fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes, she continues. restricting a woman right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. i have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life. kate andersen brower, a journalist and author of the book first women,  she was shocked by the comments. so shocked that i wanted to check it was real, she . she's very much been in line with her husband, so on this issue how did she spend all those years watching him derail something that she seems to care about? more than the other first ladies, ms brower , s trump's comments appear diametrically opposed to her husband's approach on the issue. and she is the only first lady so far to make her stance on abortion known while her husband is actively seeking re-election. indeed, the timing of s trump's comments suggest a possible political angle, ms brower . it's not out of the realm of possibility that this was done intentionally to come out right before the election, because it could appeal to those swing state voters who are upset about the overturning of roe v wade, she . maybe they could see this as a sign that he [trump] perhaps is softening on abortion. the notion of s trump trying to help out her husband doesn’t track with the melania we know, she . at this point in the game it doesn’t change anything, and she knows that, ms shah . early ballots have already gone out in certain places. it just too late. abortion access is a key issue in next month's 2024 election - and it is considered a weak point for the republican party, which has struggled to appeal to a conservative base that opposes the procedure and a wider electorate that supports abortion access, external. throughout the 2024 campaign, donald trump's position on the issue has fluctuated. earlier this week, the republican presidential nominee  for the first time that he would veto any federal abortion ban in the unlikely event that such a measure ever passed congress. the  has contacted the trump campaign for comment. democratic presidential nominee kamala harris has sought to capitalise on trump's position in an effort to galvanise voters. she has regularly cast trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of the overturning of roe v wade, which took place after he appointed a conservative majority to the supreme court. sadly for the women across america, s trump husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three american women live under a trump abortion ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives, sarafina chitika, a spokeswoman for the harris-walz campaign  the .north america correspondent anthony zurcher makes sense of the race for the white house in his twice weekly us election unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here.

deputy prime minister angela rayner has defended labour's stance on its staff volunteering for kamala harris's presidential campaign. she  the commons that people in their own time often go on campaigns, adding that it happens in all political parties. speaking at pmqs rayner  no laws had been broken and the campaigners were volunteers. donald trump's campaign filed a complaint alleging labour had broken us election rules on foreign interference by sending activists to campaign for harris, his democratic party opponent. rayner was standing in for sir keir starmer, who earlier played down the row while on his way to samoa for the commonwealth heads of government meeting.rayner was responding to a question from stephen flynn, leader of the snp at westminster, who invited her to join him in applauding the brave labour staff members who travelled across the atlantic to campaign against donald trump. the deputy pm replied: people in their own time often go and campaign, and that's what we've seen. it happens in all political parties, people go and campaign and they do what they want to do with their own time, with their own money. the row over campaigning was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from labour's head of operations, sofia patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to america before polling day. the linkedin post  she had 10 spots available for anyone willing to travel to north carolina to campaign for harris, adding we will sort your housing. foreign nationals are permitted to volunteer in political campaigns in the us as long as they are not compensated,  federal election commission rules. labour party sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is concern about whether the row could impact the so-called special relationship between the uk and us should trump win the election on 5 november.on wednesday, scotland office minister kirsty mcneill pulled out of a guest appearance at an online event on us election night in support of harris. mcneill had been due to speak at a labour for women meeting called come on kamala in a personal capacity to provide election analysis, a government spokesperson . however, her appearance had drawn criticism online and from the shadow scottish secretary john lamont, who accused mcneill of hosting a fully fledged rally for harris. the trump campaign complaint to the federal election commission flags that senior labour party staff attended the democratic convention in chicago and met harris campaign team, naming morgan mcsweeney, the prime minister chief of staff, and matthew doyle, downing street director of communications. deborah mattinson, sir keir former director of strategy, was also named as someone who travelled to washington in september to brief harris campaign on labour election-winning approach. it is understood from labour officials that labour met mcsweeney costs, while doyle was hosted by the progressive policy institute, a us think tank. but the officials  it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the harris campaign, adding that labour sends a delegation to each democratic convention. officials also pointed out that mattinson left the labour party staff after july's general election in the uk.sir keir briefly addressed the issue during his plane journey, telling reporters: the labour party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election. they’re doing it in their spare time. they’re doing it as volunteers. they’re staying i think with other volunteers over there. he denied the row would impact his relationship with trump, reminding reporters the two had dinner together at trump tower in new york last month. the prime minister deputy spokesperson stressed that the uk would always have a deep and strong relationship with the us as our closest ally whoever won the election. she was not aware of any plans for government ministers to speak to trump campaign team, but sir keir and trump had discussed the long-standing friendship between the two nations during their new york dinner, she . it is a special relationship which has endured for over a century with leaders of all political stripes, and that will always be the case, she added. defence secretary john healey suggested the trump campaign was creating controversy ahead of the presidential election. however, nigel farage, the reform uk leader and trump supporter,  the  he believed the wording of the linkedin post breached us election law, saying the rules were very, very clear.farage, who has travelled to the us to support his friend on multiple occasions, : the ad didn’t say you’ll be going in your own free time, didn’t say you’ll have to pay your own air fare, which at the moment, by the way, are very, very expensive, it  you’re going to have free accommodation. if you look at the wording of that advert there is little doubt that is against american election law. filings with the us department of justice reveal that farage himself has received help three times since his election as an mp in july from a pr firm based in pennsylvania, including with hotel costs on a trip to the usa. the company, capital hq llc, is run by alexandra preate, who used to be an aide to trump former strategist steve bannon. the filings show the firm paid more than $3,500 (£2,700) for farage accommodation at the republican national convention in milwaukee in july. it also helped with his perception management, as well as public relations, travel and logistics. capital hq disclosed it had also assisted with his appearance on a fox news business programme in july, in which he was outspoken in support of trump election prospects. it also spoke to him in august about an upcoming trip to the united states. the filings were made under us laws requiring anyone who acts on behalf of foreign principals engaged in political activity, such as seeking to influence policy or public opinion there, to register with the federal government. the clacton mp has declared £32,836 he separately received from a donor for flights and accommodation for a visit to the united states in july. asked about this on  politics live programme, farage  he hopped on somebody else plane, they gave me a free lift, adding that he had declared it and didn’t campaign at all. i went in a
