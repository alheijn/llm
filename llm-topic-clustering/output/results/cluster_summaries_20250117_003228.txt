met faces service cuts without more cash,  chiefthe boss of the uk's largest police force has warned it faces eye-watering cuts to services unless ministers increase its funding. met commissioner sir mark rowley  the  he was deeply troubled by talks so far on its annual settlement for next year. he added that the force was in a precarious position because previously used options to prop up its budget were no longer available. the government has  it plans to increase the overall policing budget next year - although allocations by force are still to be negotiated.the met's budget for this year is just over £3.5bn, a 3.5% increase from 2023/24, comprising £2.6bn from central government and £956m from local taxes. sir mark  conversations over its funding allocation from next april - which would normally be expected to be announced in december or january - were still ongoing with the government and city hall. but, speaking to  radio 4's political thinking with nick robinson, he  he was deeply troubled by the situation we appear to be heading towards. policing a global capital such as london came with an extra set of challenges, he , adding that spending per person was lower than in other cities such as new york and sydney. he  that the cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so had put the force in a more and more precarious position, and some of its buildings would be unusable in a few years without further investment. some of the things that successive [police] commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out, he added. the chancellor has been very clear - it's a difficult public sector context.you add all those things together, and you get a dramatic change in budgets of a scale that's never going to be absorbed by efficiencies, and is going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to london. he added that he was not going to get into detail at this stage on the tough choices the force would face without an increase in resources. but he  he planned to specify 10 or 20 things we're going to do differently before christmas. he added that the implications for policing in the capital would become more public in the coming weeks. the budget for the home office is set to shrink by 3.3% next year in real terms, with the bulk of this coming from assumed savings on asylum support. at last month's budget, the government  it planned to increase the core government grant for police forces, although it did not specify whether this would be in cash terms or taking account of inflation. before the election, labour also  it also planned to save £360m through more efficient purchasing of police equipment, which it promised to spend on extra community support officers.sign up for our politics essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the uk and stay up to speed with the big moments. it’ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

new deals with balkan states to target people smugglersthe uk has signed new agreements with western balkan countries to tackle people-smuggling gangs, as part of efforts to bring down small boat crossings. the deals will increase intelligence sharing and cooperation with serbia, north macedonia and kosovo to intercept and arrest the gangs, with the aim of breaking their business models at source. the government  the region was a key route used by those who end up in the european union or uk illegally, with almost 100,000 migrants transiting through the western balkans last year. prime minister sir keir starmer announced the plans at a meeting of the european political community (epc) in hungarian capital budapest on thursday.more than 31,000 people have crossed the channel in small boats so far this year - more than the same period last year. the uk already has agreements with countries including albania and turkey to share intelligence to disrupt people-smuggling gangs. sir keir : there is a criminal empire operating on our continent, exacting a horrendous human toll and undermining our national security. he  the uk would be at the heart of the efforts to end the scourge of organised immigration crime but we cannot do it in isolation. he added: we need to go further and faster, alongside our international partners, and take the fight directly to the heart of these vile people smuggling networks. home secretary yvette cooper : working more closely with serbia, north macedonia and kosovo, we will share information and intelligence, and work across borders to map out what is happening and where, to break the business models of these unscrupulous gangs at source.it comes after the government announced an extra £75m funding for the uk's new border security command, which brings together police, intelligence and immigration enforcement agencies to tackle small boat crossings. graeme biggar, the national crime agency's (nca) director general,   radio 4's today programme that continuing to work with international partners was crucial. he added that it is very difficult to have exact confidence on how much measures would reduce the number of uk small boat crossings as so much depends on what's happening with the rest of the world. on tackling people-smuggling gangs,  biggar  that what is particularly hard for the nca is that the people themselves are not illegal, their presence in the uk or in some countries on the way here may be illegal, and often the tools that they are using to get here are not themselves illegal - boats and engines. so being able to prove a criminal conspiracy is quite hard, he added. the epc was set up in 2022 in response to russia's invasion of ukraine as a way of bringing together european heads of government for informal talks and improving cooperation. the group includes the 27 members of the eu as well as 20 other european countries.

fixing social care is urgent,  minister, after claims of impassereforming the social care system in england is urgent, cabinet minister louise haigh has , after sources  the  there was a genuine impasse at the top of government over the issue. the transport secretary  the government had already taken steps to improve pay and tackle vacancies in the sector, as well as giving councils an extra £600m in funding for adult and children's social care. in its election manifesto, labour promised to create a national care service to deliver consistent care across the country - but so far the party has given little detail on what this would look like.liberal democrat leader sir ed davey called for cross-party talks on how to reform the system in the long-term, but  there also needed to be immediate measures. the prime minister, health secretary and chancellor are due to meet in the next 10 days to discuss the issue. multiple sources have  the  the department of health is keen to proceed with an overhaul of the social care system but that the treasury is reluctant to commit to significant costs without clear political backing from number 10.it really urgent that we fix this issue, haigh . for too long we’ve let this problem fester. pressed over whether the government was taking the problem seriously, she  the 's sunday with laura kuenssberg programme that the health secretary had already set out a 10-year plan for the nhs which included focusing on prevention and community care, which she  would ease pressures on social care. she also pointed to the government's plans to improve pay and conditions in the sector through a fair pay agreement, allowing negotiations between workers, unions and employers. we need to make sure we are tackling those long-term issues in the workforce, with progression opportunities, properly paid and properly negotiated on a collective basis, she added.the adult social care system helps older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and eating, and covers support in people's own homes, as well as care homes. unlike the nhs, social care is means-tested and people are usually expected to contribute towards the cost. this means some people face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result. deborah crisp  the programme how three years ago her 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, had to sell her flat for just under £200,000 to pay for a care home - and that amount had already been used up. now that money has gone, she . the local authority say they cannot fund her to stay where she is and she will need to be moved somewhere else, and we feel that due to her multiple health issues it will be catastrophic for her to be moved elsewhere - and we really fear for her safety.ministers are considering whether to create a royal commission, with cross-party involvement, to look at how to reform the social care system, or a shorter government-backed independent review. sir ed  although the lib dems would back a royal commission there needed to be immediate measures first and it must not be an excuse for long-grassing this. he  there were things the government could do straight away, for example on tackling vacancies in the sector. the lib dem leader called on the government to be more ambitious, pointing to his party's own proposals for a higher minimum wage for care workers. politicians have been failing on this for far too long, he  the . there are millions of people suffering, families being hit financially, people in misery and pain, and we have got to tackle this. he added that the lib dems were willing and ready to take part in negotiations over the issue but he had not yet had a call from health secretary wes streeting to do so. conservative shadow home secretary chris philp accused the government of having no plan to tackle the issues with social care. he  the  the government decision to increase the rate of national insurance contributions paid by employers would also make it even more difficult for the care sector to operate. providers have warned these increased staffing costs could force some care homes to close.

is this the final chapter of the sue gray saga?five weeks after sue gray resigned as the prime minister chief of staff, with the prospect of her being sacked hovering close, she is off again. and just like last time, even the manner of her departure is contested. we have been  the prime minister had decided to withdraw the offer for ms gray to be his envoy to the nations and regions. and, we understand, the cabinet secretary, the most senior civil servant in the country, had spoken to her to confirm this. this chain of events is not disputed by other figures in government. but ms gray is adamant it was her decision, we are , and she never spoke directly to the prime minister about it. a friend of ms gray  the : sue has taken a decision not to take the role. she going to focus on other things. they added: she taken time to think about it properly, talking to stakeholders, but ultimately she decided she doesn’t want to do it. it appears the prime minister had grown tired of ms gray failure to actually start the paid, part-time job that she had been demoted into when she left downing street. given 38 days had gone by since it was publicly known she had been offered the new role, it had been clear for some time that she didn’t want to do it.it seems reasonable to conclude, at the very least, that both sides were having second thoughts. it also seems reasonable to say that a second bout of messy and not entirely consistent briefing from each camp underlines the central truth in all of this - the hurt, the rows, the anger, the mistrust which has been there for all to see. her apparent lack of enthusiasm was almost immediately evident, when she failed to turn up at the first ever meeting of a new council of the nations and regions in edinburgh just days into the job. what followed were daily questions to the prime minister official spokesman from reporters about whether she had taken up her post. after weeks of stonewalling, an answer: no. one insider got in touch about the envoy role and : we all thought it was a bad idea that would lead to endless drama and probably another resignation down the line. in other words, what might have seemed like a mutually convenient layby into which ms gray could be shunted, ended up perpetuating a rather public soap opera. some sceptics had seen the new gig as a non-job from the start. the government saying it isn’t looking to fill the vacancy will do little to dispel that instinct from those who thought it all along. the scottish national party mp pete wishart mocked the news, telling the commons: we got the crushing news today that our british envoy to scotland will no longer be coming there to represent this parliament. we were practising the street parties and the haka just to be sure that she was properly welcome to the northern territories, he added. so, what might happen next? some have pondered that ms gray may be offered a seat in the house of lords – but would that revive all of these issues again? incidentally, beyond all the noise about ms gray it is worth reflecting on other more recent changes in downing street – both in personnel and managerial instinct. two blair-era labour advisers are returning to the heart of government in senior roles – jonathan powell as national security adviser and liz lloyd as director of policy delivery and innovation. this reconfiguration coincides with sir keir starmer coming to a view four-and-a-half months into the job as prime minister that it isn’t sufficient for no 10 to merely empower government departments to crack on with their work. they need a strong team captain, as one source put it. this is the broader part of the post-sue reset, the source added, saying it amounted to a significant reassessment in how sir keir wanted to approach a job he has been learning how best to grapple with. ms gray has been a case study in the early difficulties of that grappling, which downing street might now finally hope to have put behind it.sign up for our politics essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the uk and stay up to speed with the big moments. it’ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

alex salmond loved creating headlines. he would be disappointed if he gave an interview that was not sufficiently interesting to make the news. as a young radio journalist, i was sent to see him at a business breakfast event where at that time he was demanding the uk join the single european currency. when i suggested this was not new, that he’d  it many times before, he : yes but i’m saying it more forcefully now because the case is more urgent. anything to make his contribution count. spending time in his company could easily make you late. he tended not to limit interview duration and enjoyed further conversation, debate and showing off a bit after the microphones were off.i can remember interviewing him in his early days as first minister at his official residence, bute house in edinburgh. the interview was over and i needed to go - but he wanted to show me a collection of silverware that had been found in a cupboard, and share something of its history. while he could be charming and entertaining and always offered a sharp analysis of the politics of the day, there was also a less pleasant side to his character. i would wince when sometimes he would show impatience and irritation towards his staff. he could be very demanding of them. i can also remember bringing a senior  editor from the newsroom in london to see him, and was astonished when he asked my colleague if he was on a colonial visit.alex salmond and alistair darling took part in a debate chaired by glenn campbell ahead of the scottish independence referendum in 2014he had a love/hate relationship with the . he loved when he was offered a prestigious spot on a network show like question time, especially when his political career was in decline. at other times, he would rage against output he did not like. he was not happy that i interviewed, anonymously, one of the women who had accused him of sexual offences in court, after he had been acquitted of all charges. it was not an attempt to re-try the case but a response to his claims of a political conspiracy. i am not sure he forgave me for that. i travelled with him to europe, the united states and china. i remember him turning up uncharacteristically early at the forbidden city in beijing to meet china vice-premier and finding himself locked out. it would have made powerful tv footage but i don’t think we got it on camera. he thought we had captured this embarrassing moment and gave me a private briefing and a couple of scoops in the hope i wouldn’t use it.alex salmond lived and breathed politics and he seemed completely lost when he was ejected from parliament in 2017. i bumped into him in edinburgh soon after and we shared a taxi to waverley station. naturally we talked politics and when it came time to part he just kept the conversation going. in recent years, we talked far less. he refused to take part in a podcast series i made about nicola sturgeon time in office - which would obviously have included the spectacular rift between them. that was not like him. in all my previous experience, he rarely missed a media opportunity. better in his view to get out there and make his case rather than shy away and let others set the narrative.

implying he would end the israel-hamas war in gaza and the israel-hezbollah war in lebanon - but has not  how. he has repeatedly  that, if he had been in power rather than joe biden, hamas would not have attacked israel because of his maximum pressure policy on iran, which funds the group. broadly, it likely trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the us out of the iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against iran and kill gen qasem soleimani - iran most powerful military commander. in the white house, trump enacted strongly pro-israel policies, naming jerusalem as israel capital and moving the us embassy there from tel aviv - a move which energised trump christian evangelical base, a core republican voter group. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called trump the best friend that israel has ever had in the white house. but critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. the palestinians boycotted the trump administration, because of washington abandonment of their claim to jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for palestinians. they were further isolated when trump brokered the so-called abraham accords, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between israel and several arab and muslim countries. they did so without israel having to accept a future independent palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy -

[breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it hard to [stop] the habit. his story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the northern territory. for many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. the northern territory is the part of australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average, external. it also more than twice the rate of the us, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. but the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. the move, which defies a un recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.business owner sunil kumar  his restaurant had five or six break-ins in the last year and is in favour of tougher lawsit's not just an issue of incarceration. it's one of inequalities too. while around 30% of the northern territory's population is aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are indigenous. so, aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. the country liberal party (clp) government  it has a mandate after campaigning to keep territorians safe. it helped the party claim a landslide victory in august's elections. among those voting for the clp was sunil kumar. the owner of two indian restaurants in darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. it's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun, explains  kumar. he  he improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. how come they are out and parents don't know? he . there should be a punishment for the parents. but while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. youth offender rates have risen since covid. last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. but the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the northern territory, australian bureau of statistics figures show. politicians, though, are playing to residents’ fears. as well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as declan's law, after declan laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. i never want another family to experience what we have,  his mother samara laverty. the passing of this legislation is a turning point for the territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place.on the day the laws started to be debated in darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. one woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. another asked: 'what if it was your child?' our young people in don dale need to have opportunity for hope,  aboriginal elder, aunty barb nasir, addressing the demonstrators. she was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. we need to always stand for them because they are lost in there, aunty barb . kat mcnamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill,  the crowd: the idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt. after a ripple of applause, she added: we are not going to stand for it. but with a large majority in parliament, the clp easily managed to pass the laws.protesters opposing the new law argue that jailing 10-year-olds is not a sustainable long-term solutionlowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. and while other australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the australian capital territory. australia is not alone – in england and wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. but in comparison, the majority of european union members make it 14, in line with un recommendations. the northern territory's chief minister, lia finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can intervene early and address the root causes of crime. we have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time, she  last month. and we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more. but for people like thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. his crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. he  he finds prison oddly comforting. it's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. most of my family has been in and out of jail. i felt like i was at home because all the boys took care of me. his two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. at one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now – his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. he's been helped by brother 2 another - an aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports first nations children caught up in the justice system.darren damaso, from the program brother 2 another,  there should be more investment in services to support young aboriginal peoplelocking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,  darren damaso, a youth leader for brother 2 another. there needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. and then we're going to slowly start to see change. but if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work.  damaso is from the larrakia aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of darwin, and he also has connections to the yanuwa and malak malak people. his organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. brother 2 another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. it's a self-perpetuating cycle,  john lawrence, a scottish criminal barrister who's been based in darwin for more than three decades. he's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. aboriginal people have no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm,   lawrence. the fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.the tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the northern territory. in queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the liberal national party played heavily on its slogan: adult crime, adult time. in a recent report by the australian human rights commission, anne hollonds, the national children commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them first nations children - the country is creating one of australia's most urgent human rights challenges. the systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps, she . we cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer. which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. what are the cultural strengths of people? what are the community strengths of people? we are building on that,  erin reilly, a regional director for children's ground. her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the aboriginal 'kinship’ system - how people fit in with their community and family. we centre indigenous world views and indigenous values and we work in a way that works for aboriginal people, explains ms reilly. we know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people. for thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. but on the outside, he , there little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. i felt like no one cared. nobody wanted to listen, he . he points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: so, i hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?

united by loyalty, trump's new team have competing agendasif personnel really does amount to policy, then we’ve learned a lot this week about how donald trump intends to govern in his second term. more than a dozen major appointments, some of which will require senate approval, offer a clearer picture of the team entrusted to drive his agenda as he returns to the white house. on the outside they appear united by one thing - loyalty to the top man. but beneath the surface, there are competing agendas. here are four factions that reveal both trump ambition and potential tricky tests ahead for his leadership.their agenda: this trio have been among the most vocal politicians actively opposing us policies, particularly under president biden. choosing gaetz as his attorney general nominee is possibly trump most controversial pick. gaetz has represented florida's first congressional district since 2017. a graduate of william and mary law school, he led the removal of california congressman kevin mccarthy as the sitting speaker of the house in october 2023. he has come under investigation by a house ethics committee for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl, using illegal drugs and misusing campaign funds. he denies wrongdoing and no criminal charges have been filed.• none five takeaways from trump's first week tulsi gabbard, picked to be trump director of national intelligence, is a military veteran who served with a medical unit in iraq. she is a former democratic congresswoman from hawaii who switched parties to support trump. gabbard has routinely opposed american foreign policy, blaming nato for russia invasion of ukraine and meeting syrian president bashar al-assad – then casting doubt on us intelligence assessments blaming assad for using chemical weapons. robert f kennedy jr, trump nominee to oversee health, is a longtime lawyer and environmentalist. he also spread fringe theories – about vaccines and the effects of 5g phone signals.this video can not be played to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser. a look at trump's cabinet and key roles... in 74 secondswhat this tells us: like trump, gaetz, gabbard and kennedy are aggressive challengers of the status quo. all three frequently tip over into conspiracy. they may be among the most determined supporters of trump plan to dismantle the bureaucratic deep state. the president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health. but bomb-throwers can also make unruly subordinates. kennedy wants stricter regulation across food and farming industries, which may collide with trump government-slashing agenda. gaetz views on some issues - he favours legalisation of marijuana - are outside the republican mainstream. and gabbard, a fierce critic of american power, will be working for a president who is not afraid to use it - for instance, against iran.• none what rfk could do on vaccines, fluoride and drugstheir agenda: the three hardliners tasked with carrying out trump border and immigration policies have vowed to strengthen security and clamp down on undocumented immigrants crossing the us-mexico border. domestically, they - and the wider incoming trump administration - have called for a drastic uptick in deportations, beginning with those considered national security or public safety threats, and a return to workplace enforcement operations that were paused by the biden administration.what it tells us: aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with mexico were primary concerns for many voters. the possibility of increased deportations and workplace raids, however, could put trump on a collision course with democratic-leaning states and jurisdictions that may decide to push back or not co-operate. some republican states - whose economies rely, in part, on immigrant labour - may also object.their agenda: trump has named the world richest person, elon musk, to lead a cost-cutting effort dubbed the department of government efficiency. he will share the role with 39-year-old investor-turned-politician vivek ramaswamy, who became an ardent trump backer after bowing out as a candidate in the republican primary. the two men are among the loudest and flashiest tech bros, a group that swung towards trump this year, seeking a champion to disavow woke political correctness and embrace a libertarian vision of small government, low taxes and light regulation. musk has floated a possible $2tn in spending cuts, vowing to send shockwaves through the government. ramaswamy, who has backed eliminating the tax-collecting agency, the irs, and the department of education, among others, wrote after the announcement: shut it down.what it tells us: the appointments are an acknowledgment of the help trump got on the campaign trail from ramaswamy and musk, the latter of whom personally ploughed more than $100m into the campaign. but time will tell what power this faction goes on to have. despite its name, the department is not an official agency. the commission will stand outside the government to advise on spending, which is partly controlled by congress. trump, who ran up budget deficits during his first term, has shown little commitment to cutting spending. he has promised to leave social security and medicare -

sir keir starmer and donald trump have agreed the relationship between the uk and us is incredibly strong and will continue to thrive, downing street has . in the first phone call between the pair after the us election, the pm offered his hearty congratulations to trump after his historic victory and  he looked forward to working closely with the president-elect, a no 10 spokeswoman . it comes after kemi badenoch urged sir keir to apologise for derogatory comments made about trump by david lammy before he was foreign secretary. in her first appearance in parliament as conservative leader, she pressed sir keir on how trump's election would affect uk policies on trade and defence.badenoch asked the prime minister if he would push for trump to get an invitation to address parliament, but did not receive a direct reply. in their phone call, downing street  the pair also discussed the situation in the middle east and the pm underscored the importance of regional stability. the leaders fondly recalled their meeting in september, and president-elect trump close connections and affinity to the united kingdom and looked forward to working with one another, a spokeswoman added. sir keir and his foreign secretary held a dinner with trump in new york in september, when the pair met for the first time.in opposition, lammy labelled trump a neo-nazi sympathising sociopath but since getting into government has sought to build bridges with the president-elect and his team. earlier, the pm's spokeswoman was pressed on whether lammy would keep his job for the entire parliament in light of his past comments, and replied: yes, he is the foreign secretary.during prime minister's questions, badenoch  the us was the uk's single biggest trade partner and warned the prime minister he would need to look after the special relationship. she  there was now a risk of increased tariffs on uk exports and asked if he would revisit talks on establishing a free trade agreement with the us. since leaving the european union, uk ministers have been keen to reach a trade deal with the us - however, there has been little progress. during his election campaign, trump pledged to dramatically increase tariffs on foreign exports. replying to badenoch, sir keir : of course we will discuss issues of our economy with the president-elect, as we already have done. later, chancellor rachel reeves  mps on the cross-party treasury select committee the uk's trading relationship with the us was crucial, but she was confident those trade flows will continue under president trump. she added: [he's] been president before, we continue to have a good and strong economic relationship... i’m optimistic about our ability to shape the global economic agenda.this video can not be played to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser. watch: pm and badenoch congratulate trump on us election victoryon defence, badenoch echoed calls from trump that european countries should increase their defence spending and urged the prime minister to match her party's commitment to raise defence spending to 2.5% of gdp by 2030. sir keir reiterated his government's commitment to the 2.5% target - although it has not set a deadline for meeting the goal. he added that, unlike the previous labour government, the conservatives had failed to meet the target while in office. he also attacked the conservatives for leaving a £17bn black hole in the ministry of defence's finances.labour accused badenoch of misleading parliament when she incorrectly  mps that the chancellor's budget did not even mention defence. badenoch's spokesman insisted she had not got it wrong because it was obvious from the context of what she had  in her previous question that she was referring to the fact that there was no reference to how labour intend to get to that 2.5%. in her budget speech last week, the chancellor  we will set a path to spending 2.5% of gdp on defence at a future fiscal event.scottish first minister john swinney  scotland and the us share many social, cultural and economic links. in that relationship, we will stand fast in support of our values of fairness, democracy and equality – ideals that america was built upon. badenoch : the world faces many serious challenges and i look forward to our two countries working together to confront them. nigel farage, reform uk leader and a friend of trump,  the president-elect was a genuine friend of the united kingdom and urged the prime minister to roll out the red carpet for him. this is a huge opportunity to be grasped.other uk party leaders have been more critical. lib dem leader sir ed davey called the election result, external a dark, dark day for people around the globe. the world largest economy and most powerful military will be led by a dangerous, destructive demagogue. fixing the uk broken relationship with the eu is even more urgent than before - we must strengthen trade and defence cooperation across europe to help protect ourselves from the damage trump will do. on this dark day, we stand in solidarity with all us citizens who fear a convicted criminal and a fascist in the white house. and labour london mayor sadiq khan, who has repeatedly clashed with trump,  many londoners would feel anxious and fearful about what the outcome of the election would mean for democracy, women's rights, the middle east, ukraine or tackling the climate crisis.north america correspondent anthony zurcher makes sense of the race for the white house in his twice-weekly us election unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here.

melania trump is latest republican first lady to back abortionmelania trump seems to have joined a long line of republican former first ladies who have come out in support of abortion rights, putting them at odds with their husbands' public views. in a short video clip promoting her forthcoming book, s trump expressed her support for women's individual freedom, describing it as an essential right that all women possess from birth. it comes a day after an excerpt of her soon-to-be-released memoir, in which she ly takes an even clearer pro-choice stance, was published in a newspaper report. s trump's apparent stance on the issue appears to contrast with the position of her husband, who has taken credit for helping overturn roe v wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion.but it follows a decades-long american tradition of republican first ladies who - since roe v wade was first decided in 1973 - have  legal abortion access should be protected. in 1975, while still in the white house, first lady betty ford called the roe ruling a great, great decision. nancy reagan waited until her husband, president ronald reagan, left office before she  publicly that she believed in a woman's choice, but her position on the issue was ly well known within the white house. barbara bush, wife of president george hw bush, and her daughter-in-law, laura bush, wife of president george w bush, were similar, revealing their stance on the issue after their husbands left the white house. i think it's important that it remain legal, because i think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons, laura bush  in a 2010 interview promoting her memoir. in a black-and-white video posted on her x account on thursday, s trump  there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. what does my body, my choice really mean?

a woman fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes, she continues. restricting a woman right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. i have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life. kate andersen brower, a journalist and author of the book first women,  she was shocked by the comments. so shocked that i wanted to check it was real, she . she's very much been in line with her husband, so on this issue how did she spend all those years watching him derail something that she seems to care about? more than the other first ladies, ms brower , s trump's comments appear diametrically opposed to her husband's approach on the issue. and she is the only first lady so far to make her stance on abortion known while her husband is actively seeking re-election. indeed, the timing of s trump's comments suggest a possible political angle, ms brower . it's not out of the realm of possibility that this was done intentionally to come out right before the election, because it could appeal to those swing state voters who are upset about the overturning of roe v wade, she . maybe they could see this as a sign that he [trump] perhaps is softening on abortion. the notion of s trump trying to help out her husband doesn’t track with the melania we know, she . at this point in the game it doesn’t change anything, and she knows that, ms shah . early ballots have already gone out in certain places. it just too late. abortion access is a key issue in next month's 2024 election - and it is considered a weak point for the republican party, which has struggled to appeal to a conservative base that opposes the procedure and a wider electorate that supports abortion access, external. throughout the 2024 campaign, donald trump's position on the issue has fluctuated. earlier this week, the republican presidential nominee  for the first time that he would veto any federal abortion ban in the unlikely event that such a measure ever passed congress. the  has contacted the trump campaign for comment. democratic presidential nominee kamala harris has sought to capitalise on trump's position in an effort to galvanise voters. she has regularly cast trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of the overturning of roe v wade, which took place after he appointed a conservative majority to the supreme court. sadly for the women across america, s trump husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three american women live under a trump abortion ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives, sarafina chitika, a spokeswoman for the harris-walz campaign  the .north america correspondent anthony zurcher makes sense of the race for the white house in his twice weekly us election unspun newsletter. readers in the uk can sign up here. those outside the uk can sign up here.

deputy prime minister angela rayner has defended labour's stance on its staff volunteering for kamala harris's presidential campaign. she  the commons that people in their own time often go on campaigns, adding that it happens in all political parties. speaking at pmqs rayner  no laws had been broken and the campaigners were volunteers. donald trump's campaign filed a complaint alleging labour had broken us election rules on foreign interference by sending activists to campaign for harris, his democratic party opponent. rayner was standing in for sir keir starmer, who earlier played down the row while on his way to samoa for the commonwealth heads of government meeting.rayner was responding to a question from stephen flynn, leader of the snp at westminster, who invited her to join him in applauding the brave labour staff members who travelled across the atlantic to campaign against donald trump. the deputy pm replied: people in their own time often go and campaign, and that's what we've seen. it happens in all political parties, people go and campaign and they do what they want to do with their own time, with their own money. the row over campaigning was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from labour's head of operations, sofia patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to america before polling day. the linkedin post  she had 10 spots available for anyone willing to travel to north carolina to campaign for harris, adding we will sort your housing. foreign nationals are permitted to volunteer in political campaigns in the us as long as they are not compensated,  federal election commission rules. labour party sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is concern about whether the row could impact the so-called special relationship between the uk and us should trump win the election on 5 november.on wednesday, scotland office minister kirsty mcneill pulled out of a guest appearance at an online event on us election night in support of harris. mcneill had been due to speak at a labour for women meeting called come on kamala in a personal capacity to provide election analysis, a government spokesperson . however, her appearance had drawn criticism online and from the shadow scottish secretary john lamont, who accused mcneill of hosting a fully fledged rally for harris. the trump campaign complaint to the federal election commission flags that senior labour party staff attended the democratic convention in chicago and met harris campaign team, naming morgan mcsweeney, the prime minister chief of staff, and matthew doyle, downing street director of communications. deborah mattinson, sir keir former director of strategy, was also named as someone who travelled to washington in september to brief harris campaign on labour election-winning approach. it is understood from labour officials that labour met mcsweeney costs, while doyle was hosted by the progressive policy institute, a us think tank. but the officials  it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the harris campaign, adding that labour sends a delegation to each democratic convention. officials also pointed out that mattinson left the labour party staff after july's general election in the uk.sir keir briefly addressed the issue during his plane journey, telling reporters: the labour party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election. they’re doing it in their spare time. they’re doing it as volunteers. they’re staying i think with other volunteers over there. he denied the row would impact his relationship with trump, reminding reporters the two had dinner together at trump tower in new york last month. the prime minister deputy spokesperson stressed that the uk would always have a deep and strong relationship with the us as our closest ally whoever won the election. she was not aware of any plans for government ministers to speak to trump campaign team, but sir keir and trump had discussed the long-standing friendship between the two nations during their new york dinner, she . it is a special relationship which has endured for over a century with leaders of all political stripes, and that will always be the case, she added. defence secretary john healey suggested the trump campaign was creating controversy ahead of the presidential election. however, nigel farage, the reform uk leader and trump supporter,  the  he believed the wording of the linkedin post breached us election law, saying the rules were very, very clear.farage, who has travelled to the us to support his friend on multiple occasions, : the ad didn’t say you’ll be going in your own free time, didn’t say you’ll have to pay your own air fare, which at the moment, by the way, are very, very expensive, it  you’re going to have free accommodation. if you look at the wording of that advert there is little doubt that is against american election law. filings with the us department of justice reveal that farage himself has received help three times since his election as an mp in july from a pr firm based in pennsylvania, including with hotel costs on a trip to the usa. the company, capital hq llc, is run by alexandra preate, who used to be an aide to trump former strategist steve bannon. the filings show the firm paid more than $3,500 (£2,700) for farage accommodation at the republican national convention in milwaukee in july. it also helped with his perception management, as well as public relations, travel and logistics. capital hq disclosed it had also assisted with his appearance on a fox news business programme in july, in which he was outspoken in support of trump election prospects. it also spoke to him in august about an upcoming trip to the united states. the filings were made under us laws requiring anyone who acts on behalf of foreign principals engaged in political activity, such as seeking to influence policy or public opinion there, to register with the federal government. the clacton mp has declared £32,836 he separately received from a donor for flights and accommodation for a visit to the united states in july. asked about this on  politics live programme, farage  he hopped on somebody else plane, they gave me a free lift, adding that he had declared it and didn’t campaign at all. i went in a purely personal capacity to offer my support after the first assassination attempt... as a friend of his and the family.

Cluster 4:
Topic:  australia have lost five of their last six matches against england in the rugby world cup . england have only one win - a comfortable cruise past japan - from their last five fixtures . South africa have beaten england 10 of their previous 11 meetings . All-brawn luke cowan-dickie comes into the squad in place of all-court theo dan theo .
Example texts: steve borthwick took over as england coach two years ago after a miserable autumn campaign in 2022 prompted eddie jones' departurecoverage: listen to live commentary on  radio 5 sports extra and  sounds, follow live text commentary on the  sport website and app.the soft centre of a southern hemisphere sandwich. that is how saturday encounter with australia appeared when england revealed their 2024 autumn fixtures. between ever-competitive new zealand and world champions south africa, england play an australia team they have beaten in 10 of their previous 11 meetings - a run that began after england's pool-stage defeat in the 2015 rugby world cup. more recent form doesn't challenge the perception either. australia have lost five of their last six matches. they finished bottom of the rugby championship. last year's rugby world cup campaign ended in a miserable pool-stage exit. they are ranked ninth in the world, below italy and a smidge above fiji. the current crop of wallabies are certainly short of bounce. they can, however, still box. canny coaches, blockbuster talent and a cherished underdog status give the tourists a puncher's chance at allianz stadium, twickenham on saturday. and, given their wobbly form, england are certainly not invulnerable to an upset. steve borthwick's side themselves have only one win - a comfortable cruise past japan - from their last five fixtures. several times in that run, they have been locked on for the winners' enclosure, only to veer into the rails in the final quarter. their ability to fade faster than a boil wash is stark. among the top 10 teams in the world this year, none have scored more points than the 77 england have chalked up between 40 minutes and 60 minutes in matches. but, contrastingly, none have scored fewer than the 35 they have managed from the hour mark to full-time. england have a points difference of 47 from 40-60 minutes in matches this year. they are minus 23 from the final quarter. the way that an eight-point lead evaporated late on against all blacks last weekend swung the spotlight onto england bench. replacement fly-half george ford missed two potentially match-winning shots. scrum-half harry randall struggled to connect with his team-mates. the rejigged forwards went into retreat.randall and ford came on just after an hour played against new zealand, with their side 22-14 upborthwick has made changes in the hope his finishers can match up to the job description. all-brawn luke cowan-dickie comes into the squad in place of all-court theo dan. the six-two split on the bench between forwards and backs has been abandoned in favour of a more conventional five-three split, meaning the pack won't be shuffled as dramatically in the closing stages. the only change to the starting xv is a positional switch in midfield, with ollie lawrence swapping to outside centre and henry slade coming inside to 12. the theory is that it should enable lawrence - restricted to two carries against new zealand - to get the ball in more space. however, the revival of a dual playmaker shape that worked fitfully under eddie jones has potential weaknesses. slade will have to lead the backline defence from a different perspective, clocking dangers both inside and outside. just back from shoulder surgery, he is also placed in the high-traffic lane where lawrence made 27 tackles against the all blacks. len ikitau - australia's hard-running inside centre - is sure to test slade early. on the other side of the ball, england certainly need something to spark their attack. against new zealand, they were heavy on perspiration, but light on inspiration. england's solitary try came from a smart marcus smith intercept of a ponderous pass, but they rarely looked as if they could pick a way though the defence via their own wit. among the world top 10 nations, only wales have been less efficient in turning entries into the 22 into points this year. england have some fine attacking talents. but, whether it is the system or individuals within it, potential has not been cashed in as points. if it had, their last four defeats - all by a converted score or less - could have been very different. england's repeated failure to get over the horizon and out of sight will give 5-1 outsiders australia hope. the instant installation of joseph-aukuso suaalii in the backline will add to it, even if the weight of expectation will surely sit heavy on the 21-year-old.suaalii was part of the samoa team that beat england in the rugby league world cup semi-final at london's emirates stadiuman age-grade phenomenon, suaalii has been brought back to union from rugby league in a statement move aimed at galvanising a team and reinvigorating a sport. for all the dollar signs and headlines though, his first game of union since his school days will come at test level, with unfamiliar team-mates alongside him and 80,000 fans in front of him. head coach joe schmidt admitted picking suaalii is a gamble, and that it was one that might not pay off immediately. if not now, when?  the new zealander. i think it makes some sense for him to play. it's unlikely it'll go perfectly, but it will be a benchmark that he can build from. angus bell and 23-stone tighthead taniela tupou are formidable foundations and the props will relish the chance to get at england at the set-piece. the back row of captain harry wilson, rob valetini and fraser mcreight have been star performers. twenty-year-old wing max jorgensen, who starts on the bench, was almost as highly hyped as suaalii coming up through school. perhaps most importantly, schmidt, who sculpted ireland's intricate patterns between 2013 and 2019, is in the stands. his steady hand is even more critical than suaalii's stardust in australia's revival. so far under him improvement has been incremental. victory over england would be a dramatic break-out success. it would also send steve borthwick's men plunging in the opposite direction before the visit of the springboks. for all australia's points of promise, it is a game england should win. but, as the twickenham regulars can attest, there have been plenty of those. and, once the final whistle had blown, markedly fewer victories.

england hang in and earn rewards in the city of saintsthey call multan the city of saints. there were times on the first day of the first test against pakistan that england must have hoped for help from the patron saint of taking wickets. an inexperienced attack, the most docile pitch, sun burning hot enough to make statues sweat and a pakistan captain determined to make up for 10 consecutive winless home matches. this was as tough as it gets. still, england stood up. despite skipper shan masood plundering 151, supported by abdullah shafique 102, the tourists stuck at it. as the light faded and the second new ball shone, the gift of babar azam plonking his pad in front of the stumps was nothing more than england deserved. at 328-4, pakistan had the better of the day, but england smiles and high fives as they made their way to the dressing room showed they have taken something from it. a good start to day two and they will be right in the match. there was a temptation to think that england could simply pick up where they left off here two years ago, when a 3-0 series win was perhaps the greatest ever in a foreign country not called australia or india. it was certainly the peak of the bazball era to date.but there is plenty different to 2022. despite their wretched run, pakistan look stronger on paper than they did then. a subtle change is the time the series is being played. december then to october now doesn’t sound much, but the elevation in temperature is uncomfortable. the biggest difference is the make-up of england pace attack. gone are the retired james anderson (more on him later), the injured mark wood and ollie robinson has been sent to coventry. in their place have come the notoriously travel-sick chris woakes, gus atkinson, a summer revelation but untried away from home, and brydon carse, untried anywhere and only just off completing a ban for historic gambling offences. it was the seamers who were key to england previous success here. whereas in 2022 the spinners largely matched each other – england took 33 wickets at an average of 37.3, pakistan 35 wickets at 36.2 – the touring seamers comfortably out-bowled the hosts. england claimed 26 victims at 23.3, pakistan just 11 at a whopping 62.7. some help from the toss would have been appreciated, but ollie pope has now lost four out of four standing-in for injured england skipper ben stokes. if england were looking for assistance from the pitch, they were left disappointed. pre-match talk of grass was dashed by a mower on monday morning. a penny for the thoughts of saim ayub, who somehow tickled atkinson 10th ball in an away test down the leg side to wicketkeeper jamie smith. he had to watch shafique and masood plunder runs from the fourth over of the day until well after tea. data analysts cricviz, the multan pitch was the second-flattest for day one of a test anywhere in the world since they started collecting such information in 2007. across the three sessions, the 0.47 degrees of swing was the least amount of movement in the air for day one in pakistan since the beginning of 2022. if there was nothing to encourage the seamers, the spinners got little more. the 2.64 degrees of turn was the second-lowest for the opening day in this country over the same time period. shoaib bashir struggled – only once in his short test career has he bowled more overs without taking a wicket - but jack leach impressed in his first test since january. despite all of the disadvantages, england hung in. the fielding was never anything but wholehearted, the only error being pope miss at the stumps when shafique should have been run out on 34. aside from that, pope did a fine job at recreating the creativity of stokes that was crucial to england win in 2022. bowlers were shuffled, fields tinkered. shafique eyeline was flooded with catchers in front of the bat and he eventually popped atkinson to cover. left-armer leach toyed with his angles to come round the wicket to left-hander masood and was rewarded with a return catch. the only mild criticism was an over-eagerness to bowl bouncers, a favourite tactic of england. carse, who touched 90mph, was asked to go to the short ball as early as the 15th over of the match. overall, 40% of the deliveries carse sent down were bouncers, 61% short of a good length. it is a plan england often revert to for bowlers with extra pace. jamie overton bowled 34% bouncers in his only test against new zealand in 2022 and olly stone 33% in his two tests against sri lanka earlier this year. wood, albeit faster and more skilful than the other three, is not used as such a blunt instrument. perhaps the biggest boost for england was the late impact of woakes. quiet for most of the day, he grabbed the second new ball to produce a nip-backer that removed pakistan best player in babar. the uk is on its fifth different prime minister since woakes’ previous asian test wicket in 2016. it was a delivery worthy of anderson, the absence of whom was made much of in the build-up to the test. england bowling consultant has been playing golf at the alfred dunhill links championship. when anderson does arrive in time for day two, he will join a team that can be optimistic following their first-day showing. in truth, unless england were going to ask anderson to take the new ball, there seems little he could have passed on to the bowlers that would have made their job any easier. in the city of saints, england did just fine without saint jimmy.• none get cricket news sent straight to your phone

england have lost three straight home matches for the first time since 2006jack van poortvliet has been here before. two years ago, as england's scrum-half huddled up under the posts, his face flashed up on twickenham's big screens. new zealand flanker dalton papali'i had just picked off his pass and cantered in to give new zealand a seven-point head start. this time around it was a kick. eben etzebeth, looming like a skyscraper, had charged down van poortvliet to give south africa a freebie try and puncture england's promising start. it will have felt like all his fault. it wasn't. england's forwards left him unprotected and vulnerable. marcus smith, his fly-half, had his own chance to clear and similarly found a south african torso. and, ultimately, the errors added up. for all england's unquestionable courage and energy, they have continually been undermined by mistakes this autumn. the foundations of a promising team always seem to be subsiding under their own slip-ups. they have come in all different matches, in all different guises, from all areas of the team. against new zealand, the crossed wires and fumbled drop-goal routine between harry randall and george ford was most obvious. against australia, england's failure to secure a kick-off – joseph-aukuso suaalii disrupting maro itoje – on the last play was key. but so was a botched midfield move that gave andrew kellaway a walk-in. against south africa, ben earl missed a vital tackle on damian de allende, before england's faint hopes of crowbarring their way to a comeback were dashed by luke cowan-dickie's twitchy line-out throw and itoje picking, not going and being caught at the back of a promising breakdown. those are individual moments, perhaps the most glaring ones. but you could pick plenty more. after three straight home defeats for the first time since 2006, the spotlight certainly shouldn't shine on van poortvliet alone. it must also extend to the sidelines to take in selections and systems.van poortvliet's inclusion was the latest scrum-half shuffle in the absence of the injured alex mitchell. ben spencer went from first choice to third string in the space of a week. randall, who started the majority of england's games in the 2022 six nations, does not seem trusted to do so now. stepping back in to start against the world champions, after more than a year out of the test rugby, was therefore the stretch asked of van poortvliet. the midfield combination of ollie lawrence and henry slade – which seemed one of the most settled parts of england's side before the autumn – hasn't mustered much punch over the last three games. tactically, england were set up to exploit their height advantage on the wing. on the turf, it never worked out that way. instead the scorching pace and side-stepping brilliance of cheslin kolbe and kurt-lee arendse was decisive. more generally, england came up short in the final quarter once more. playing against 14 for half of it, they failed to score a single point. across 2024, they have conceded 30 more points than they have scored after the hour mark. whether it is fitness, lack of tactical finesse or a shortage of bench strength, the fade is real. in attack, plan a was to lean heavily and hopefully on marcus smith to produce a moment of magic. it doesn't seem to progress much further through the alphabet.marcus smith carried 12 times from fly-half, with only number eight ben earl doing so more for england against south africaand in defence, they have conceded an average of 32 points a game so far this autumn, letting in 12 tries in three matches. when it comes to sorting these problems little is made easier by an environment that chews through coaches at an alarming rate. england needed to be spotless to make up a chasm in class and form on south africa. in paris, in last year's rugby world cup semi-final, they very nearly were. on saturday though, the blemishes were obvious and plentiful - and this autumn they seem to be setting in, rather than shifting. a bad day in the office seems to have become the standard. against a ragged japan, even an error-strewn england should be good enough. they saw off the brave blossoms by 35 points in the summer. whatever mind games and inside information eddie jones has is unlikely to stop a repeat defeat for japan. one win would be scant return from an autumn that promised more however. and all the time, the six nations, renewed rivalries with the northern hemisphere's best and fears england are just not as good as we thought, lurk like etzebeth around a breakdown.

new zealand into semis after pakistan all out for 56this video can not be played to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser. new zealand into t20 world cup semis after pakistan all out for 56new zealand booked their place in the semi-finals of the women's t20 world cup with a comprehensive 54-run win over pakistan in dubai. pakistan needed to chase their target of 111 within 10.4 overs to keep themselves in knockout contention via net run-rate, but paid the price for their aggressive intent by slumping to 56 all out in 11.4 overs. despite collapsing to 28-5 after the six-over powerplay, the pakistan batters kept attacking to keep their hopes alive rather than simply settle for a comfortable chase of less than a run-a-ball. new zealand's batters had earlier struggled against pakistan's spin attack, who expertly stifled the run-rate in the middle overs but were let down in the field with eight catches put down. suzie bates was dropped twice in her 28, the innings' top score, and then crucially three were put down in the final over which allowed maddy green and izzy gaze to scamper nine extra runs. but while their 110-6 felt below-par, new zealand were rewarded for a disciplined all-round bowling effort with some assistance from pakistan's chaotic but understandable approach. leg-spinner melie kerr starred with 3-14 while fellow spinner eden carson took 2-7. it is new zealand's first semi-final in either white-ball format since 2016, and they join six-time winners australia from group a with india eliminated. they will face the winner of group b which will be either south africa, england or west indies, with the latter two teams playing on tuesday.this video can not be played to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser.few would have had new zealand as semi-final contenders before the tournament began as they came in with 10 straight t20 defeats, but started in sensational style by thumping potential winners india in their opener. and despite a heavy defeat by relentless australia, they have continued to dominate against sri lanka and pakistan to finish the group stage with plenty of momentum. the pre-match equation was simple, with a win of any margin enough, but there appeared to be some early nerves in the batting line-up given the pressure of the situation. pakistan will rue the dropped catches - it was a pitiful display which saw bonus chances given to bates, kerr, sophie devine and brooke halliday. none of them capitalised enough to really rub salt into the wound, but just enough to ensure that pakistan had to go hard early in their chase and maintain it, which proved way beyond their capabilities. opener muneeba ali struck two early boundaries in her 15 before she was bowled by lea tahuhu, who also brilliantly ran out number three iram javed from short third. the powerful aliya riaz was promoted to open but the experiment did not pay off as she fell for a duck, as did sidra ameen, while captain fatima sana's 21 from 23 balls was the only contribution of note as the middle to lower order was skittled by the wily spin of kerr and carson. and while there were wild screams of delight and hugs of joy between the new zealand players at the end, there will be a thorough examination for india, who would have been watching anxiously, but ultimately in despair. they launched a huge franchise tournament, the women's premier league, in early 2023 to catch up with australia and while it has seen the emergence of some young talent including spinner shreyanka patil and seamer arundhati reddy, this is a disappointing tournament from the 2020 finalists. they thrashed sri lanka and pakistan, fought admirably against australia but it was the opening defeat by new zealand that left them with an uphill climb, one which proved too steep.this video can not be played to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser. 'poor' drop from pakistan's nashra sandhu as new zealand's suzie bates survivesnew zealand captain sophie devine: it hasn't sunk in yet. we will certainly celebrate tonight but this is just the next stage of a tournament we are looking forward to. on their young players: it is about going in [to the semi-final] with open eyes and enjoying it. i want them to lap up the experience. it is an awesome opportunity for them and a huge part of their career. these are the reasons you play cricket. pakistan captain fatima sana: we were good in the bowling but we need to improve our fielding and batting because we were not up to the mark. we need to improve or we can't survive at this level. england bowler tash farrant on  test match special: new zealand's youngsters have come to the party in this tournament - like eden carson who bowled really well. they've not just relied on their senior players this time. they've had a really tough time after the last world cup in south africa. but they are a tight-knit group and that is what is needed in these circumstances.• none notifications, social media and more with  sport

england have a 'point to prove' in pivotal sa seriesin october, england failed to reach the semi-finals of the women's t20 world cup for the first time since 2010whether england want to admit it or not, they have a point to prove. just over a month after their disastrous group-stage exit from the women's t20 world cup, heather knight's side are in south africa for a multi-format series, which is followed by the women's ashes in australia in january. the first of three t20s starts on sunday (12:00 gmt), followed by three one-day internationals and then a four-day test begins on 15 december. you can ball-by-ball radio commentary on every game on the  sport website and app, plus live text updates. it is a quick turnaround from such a disappointing world cup campaign but seamer kate cross, who is in the odi and test squads, feels that will benefit england. years ago, if you were knocked out of a world cup, you had to wait until your summer to play cricket again and prove yourself, cross  's no balls podcast. but i feel like cricket has been back on our horizon so quickly after that, against the team who lost the final, so we know we've got a chance to measure ourselves against a really strong team in their own conditions and you're back in the fight straight away. the fallout from the world cup was possibly the harshest that an england women's side has faced, a stark reminder of the increased scrutiny and expectation that comes with the privilege of being a professional athlete. the team's fitness was questioned, alongside their off-field activities and social media presence. knight and head coach jon lewis rejected the accusations and understandably defended their team, but acknowledged their need to improve in pressure moments - though that is something they have been saying for almost two years. against south africa, finalists of  world cup, england have a chance to change these perceptions before entering the ashes pressure cooker.lewis and knight have put faith in their group, too. top-order batter alice capsey was initially dropped from the world cup squad for the t20 leg of the tour, but has since been recalled after an injury to all-rounder paige scholfield, while danielle gibson is the only other omission because of a knee problem. fast bowler lauren filer comes into all three squads as a particularly exciting prospect for the ashes. south africa have rested star all-rounder marizanne kapp and seamer ayabonga khaka for the t20 series, but both will likely return for the odis and the test. lewis has acknowledged the difficulty in replicating high-pressure situations outside of matches, and going into the world cup his side had barely been challenged in a relatively low-key summer which involved dominant series wins over pakistan and new zealand, who eventually won the tournament. but the intense two months ahead should not be lacking in pressure: south africa will also have fire in the belly after losing the t20 final, while facing the game's dominant force, australia, in their own backyard is one of cricket's greatest tasks. it will not be easy, considering the significant amount of time they will be spending away from home and against two high-quality teams. but it is a golden opportunity for england to silence critics and regain the form and excitement at the heart of their brand of cricket in 2023, the high-profile summer which saw both england men and women gripped in enthralling ashes contests.• none get cricket news sent straight to your phone

amorim vows to restore man utd to where club 'belongs'manchester united's first home game under ruben amorim will be against norwegian side bodo/glimt in the europa league on 28 novembermanchester united's new head coach ruben amorim  he is confident of putting the club back where it belongs. amorim flew into manchester on monday after being confirmed as erik ten hag replacement. the 39-year-old is the seventh man since sir alex ferguson's retirement in 2013 to take up the challenge of trying to get united competing for major trophies again. none of them has been able to engineer a sustained premier league title push, taken united beyond the last eight of the champions league or completed three full seasons in the job. in his first public comments since arriving in the uk, former sporting boss amorim  united's club media he is determined to change that narrative. i will try to do everything to put this club in the place that it belongs, he . and i believe a lot that we are going to succeed.united have posted a number social media images of amorim meeting players, executives and some fans who were on a tour of old trafford when he walked into the home dressing room. he has also tried to soak in some of the club's storied past. not just the record 20 english titles and three european cups but also the dark days of the munich air disaster and the rise to glory under sir matt busby. while most supporters were not alive when that happened, amorim feels it is important players understand the magnitude of the club they are playing for. you see the trophies and you see the tragedy that we have as a club, he . you understand the history, after the crash, then we were european champions. it is important to put this kind of strength in the team. when the players come here, they should make the same tour. it is very important. you have to feel this is manchester united. as the players he met earlier in the week, including england trio kobbie mainoo, luke shaw and mason mount, were all doing rehabilitation, it will be next week before amorim will really get to work. alejandro garnacho and manuel ugarte have world cup qualifying commitments in south america in the early hours of wednesday morning uk time, so it will likely be friday before he has his full squad together to prepare for his first game in charge, at ipswich, on 24 november. amorim accepts not everything will be to his satisfaction. but he is promising fans they will see a team that is inherently his. the most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character we had in the past, he . we will focus a lot on our game model - how to play, how to press, these small things. you cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. but if i have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, it is identity. judgement around amorim's appointment will be made against united's new structure, from co-owner sir jim ratcliffe, through board member sir dave brailsford, chief executive omar berrada, sporting director dan ashworth and technical director jason wilcox. berrada has been the driving force behind amorim's appointment, with ashworth and wilcox the executives he will be working with most closely. amorim  he feels there is a strong connection already and he can see the excitement around ineos' wider plans for the club. we want to do something special in a special club - that was a key point, he . when manchester united  me about their plans, you get excited. we know if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. it's a real honour that i was the first choice to start that path.this video can not be played to play this video you need to enable javascript in your browser.

stokes doubtful for first test against pakistanben stokes has not played for england since the end of julyengland captain ben stokes is a doubt for the first test against pakistan in multan as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury. stokes, 33, has been out since the beginning of august, missing the 2-1 series victory over sri lanka. england trained in multan for the first time on friday. all-rounder stokes batted in the nets and bowled a handful of deliveries off a few paces. he indicated last week he is unlikely to bowl at the beginning of this three-match series, which gets under way on monday. opener zak crawley   sport: he seems to be going well, recovering well from his injury. we don't know just yet. i think he's got to do a few more tests, but he's been doing some running and stuff. if stokes is fit to play, but not bowl, england will have a decision on how to balance their side. against sri lanka they played five specialist bowlers, which would mean leaving out one of their regular top order.to avoid dropping a batter, or even leaving out wicketkeeper jamie smith and handing the gloves to ollie pope, england could play four specialist bowlers and lean on joe root's off-spin. curiously, balancing the side might be easier if stokes is ruled out completely. pope would continue to deputise as skipper, smith could remain at six, leaving space for the five bowlers, which seems particularly necessary in temperatures of around 36 degrees. crawley  the multan pitch currently has a green tinge, so england may feel the need for three seamers and two spinners. with pace bowler olly stone set to leave the tour for his wedding and josh hull ruled out of the tour with a quad injury, brydon carse could be in line for a test debut, possibly vying for a place in the side with durham team-mate matthew potts. we've got a really deep squad, with plenty of options with the ball and with the bat as well, added crawley. we've got bowlers who can bat really well, as proven in the summer. we feel ready. whatever team comes out, it will be a nice balance either way. crawley is also returning from an injury after spending more than two months out with a broken finger. the 26-year-old damaged the little finger on his right hand attempting a slip catch as england wrapped up a 3-0 series win over west indies at edgbaston in july. he was unable to hold a bat for five weeks, then returned to training just over two weeks ago. though crawley believes he is fit to return to his usual fielding position of second slip, he has been given medical advice to refrain from doing so yet. i feel brand new, he . i'm looking forward to getting out there. i've certainly missed it, so i can't wait to get out there again with the boys. i've come back with a new hunger. i feel like i've got a lot of energy. no one wants any time out and i wouldn't choose to do it again, but i've taken some positives from it for sure. test match special will have live ball-by-ball commentary of england's tour of pakistan on  sounds, the  sport website and app, and  radio 5 sports extra.• none get cricket news sent straight to your phone

ben earl scored his first try of england's autumn nation series campaignengland ended their five-match losing run with a nine-try hammering of eddie jones' japan at twickenham's allianz stadium. the victory marked a first and only win of a difficult autumn nation series campaign for steve borthwick's side after close defeats by new zealand, australia and south africa. captain jamie george scored twice in a clinical opening period, which saw ben earl, sam underhill and ollie sleightholme also grab tries. the brave blossoms managed one eye-catching score in the first half through captain naoto saito. full-back george furbank gathered tommy freeman's sublime behind-the-back pass to score england's sixth try in the second half, before replacement hooker luke cowan-dickie burrowed over the line for the first of his two tries. flanker kazuki himeno's try gave jones' side a deserved second-half score, but the hosts finished the strongest with tom roebuck adding to cowan-dickie's score for his first international try. it was borthwick's side's first win since june when they comfortably beat japan 52-17 in tokyo. former england head coach jones, who was sacked by the rugby football union in 2022 and later replaced by borthwick, kept a low profile in the build-up to his return, having been in charge during england's joint-worst run since 2018 of five straight defeats. his successor ends the year with five wins from 12 games as borthwick continues to navigate a tough transition period following a third-placed finish at last year's rugby world cup. at least one statement scalp would have been expected after signs of progress in this year's six nations and during the summer tests against new zealand, meaning a sole win over japan to end a dreadful run will instead go down as an autumn to forget.despite three intense fixtures on the bounce, borthwick opted against wholesale changes as he offered his regulars a chance to finish the autumn on a high. the final quarter of matches has proved to be england's sticking point in recent games, with late leads blown against new zealand and australia. what has remained a strength is their ability to start fast and that continued when marcus smith sent ollie lawrence through a hole and the bath centre found earl who ran under the posts for the opening score. flanker underhill then showed his power for the second week in a row close to the try-line to extend the lead, before captain george dotted down twice from rampaging mauls. that ability to close out a tight test match was never likely to be challenged by the brave blossoms, who despite improvement under jones, were heavily defeated by new zealand and france this autumn. however, japan's high-paced attacking style finally clicked as saito got on the end of dylan riley's break after some slick handling from inside their own half. but the hosts were able to respond through an equally impressive flowing move when will stuart's initial break led to sleightholme's sharp finish in the corner, as the northampton saints wing showed his instinctive finishing ability by regathering his own grubber kick for a fourth autumn try.tommy freeman set up george furbank's try with a sublime behind-the-back passan outrageous piece of skill from freeman, who flung the ball behind his back to set up club team-mate furbank, then raised the volume in an allianz stadium. in their games against the all blacks and world champions south africa, england had failed to score after the 60th minute. following himeno's try, any concern over whether they could finish strongly was quickly answered by cowan-dickie's second try from close range. replacement roebuck, who impressed off the bench, showed his lethal finishing skills from fin smith's crossfield kick, fending off one defender before a sharp step sent him over. for england, a full house of victories over rugby's big three southern hemisphere sides was always a big ask. small margins prevented them from picking up at least one other victory than this, but ending their miserable run was at least a step forward for borthwick after a challenging month.

marcus smith has nailed down his spot as england's starting fly-half this autumncoverage: listen to live commentary on  radio 5 sports extra and  sounds, follow live text commentary on the  sport website and appfly-half marcus smith is improving the way he dovetails with the rest of england's attack,  assistant coach andrew strawbridge. smith, 25, has been one of england's standout performers in three autumn nations series defeats against new zealand, australia and south africa. however, despite smith's creativity in attack and accuracy from the kicking tee, england are still on their worst run since 2018 after five straight defeats. i have found marcus really open to discussions about the game, strawbridge   sport. he is getting better and better at having a deeper understanding of the game and his role in it. since his premiership debut for harlequins as an 18-year-old, regular eye-catching performances left many calling for smith to be england's long-term option at fly-half. now capped 38 times, he has started six tests in a row for the first time since 2022, but five have resulted in defeats - four of which came down to the final play. england's opening try on saturday against south africa came when smith opted against a drop-goal, darted to the blindside and set up ollie sleightholme for a run into the corner. strawbridge  that england's attack allows for such improvisation, and is also confident smith's game management is improving. in some environments i have been in we put all the pressure on the 10 like a quarterback in american football - they make all the decisions, the calls and the plays. that isn't the case here, he added. we are spreading the decision-making and we are trying to sharpen that edge. marcus' decisions are within that structure.strawbridge joined england's coaching set-up on a full-time basis in april after spending four weeks in the camp as a consultant during the six nationsthe last time england lost five straight games was under eddie jones, who returns to his former employers on sunday as japan boss. having defeated jones' side - in their most recent victory by 35 points in june - england go in as heavy favourites to end their miserable run. we have had growth this campaign, strawbridge added. i get people from the outside finding that hard to believe, but this is a further opptortunity for us consolidate some of our practices in seeing things and executing things. this is a step, not a launching pad or a saving grace, in the development of a good, good test team.

for shakhtar donetsk, the stark realities of war in ukraine are never far away.two days before they were due to play kryvbas in september, the hotel they were set to be staying in was hit by a russian missile.local media , external four people were killed and more injured in the attack in kryvyi rih, just over 40 miles from the nearest russian-occupied territory and a regular target of air strikes.can you imagine this, our team staying in this hotel and what can happen? shakhtar chief executive sergei palkin tells  sport.it is difficult to manage a team and difficult to attract new players in this kind of situation. for me, it is difficult to push players to kryvyi rih and play this game.finally, we arrived. but after this incident, families of players were writing us a lot of letters and a lot of messages. agents of players were writing 'what will we do?'ok, we have done everything in a good way, with a full level of security, but in any case, from a mental point of view, it is difficult to convince players to go there and play.the ukrainian premier league match went ahead as planned, but was interrupted in the 51st minute, external after an air raid alert, with the remainder of the game postponed to a later date. a league game against dnipro earlier this year was also stopped several times by sirens.i was worried, my family was worried, i know that the wives of footballers were very worried. as for the foreign players, it's understandable. they came to another country and were frightened, but they pulled themselves together,  captain taras stepanenko after the kryvbas incident.it's hard, it's not very pleasant, and i think that the people who organise our tournaments, who organise the matches, should pay more attention to safety because it's not funny.the fear, that anxiety, goes both ways. as shakhtar player georgi sudakov   sport in february on the two-year anniversary of the war: it's psychologically hard when your family is far away and the first thing you see in the morning after waking up is a text from your wife saying that she and your child are hiding in the bathroom.
