Topic:  Eurovision winner nemo says the song contest's organisers didn't do enough to support contestants who were caught up in a row over israel's inclusion in this year's show . i felt very alone, the swiss singer, 25, who has just released their first single since winning the contest, eurostar, was speaking to  news after their track was released .
Example texts: eurovision failed to support us amid rows, winner eurovision winner nemo has  the song contest's organisers didn't do enough to support participants who were caught up in a row over israel's inclusion in this year's show. i felt very alone, the swiss singer, 25,   news. i really hope they have things in place for the next year. nemo, who has just released their first single since winning the contest in may, added that the event had in a way been overshadowed by the political controversy. the european broadcasting union (ebu), which runs eurovision,  it had introduced changes that would provide more clarity and protection for artists at future contests.in the build-up to this year's eurovision, there were calls for israel to be banned from the competition over the country's military action in gaza, and pro-palestinian protests on the streets of swedish host city malmö. some contestants, including nemo, came under pressure to boycott the show, while israel's entrant eden golan ly faced death threats.nemo, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, has since got a record deal and was speaking to  news after their new track, eurostar, was released. reflecting on their experiences during eurovision, nemo described the atmosphere backstage as quite tense. there were situations that are still being investigated by the ebu, they . they  us they would get back to us and they haven't yet. it's a shame that the ebu takes so long in my honest opinion. when asked if the organisers did enough to support contestants at the time, they paused before answering. no. i don't think so, they . because i sometimes felt very alone with a lot of things, or at least with the other artists, and it took long for them to get back to artists when they wrote to them. with global politics remaining febrile, nemo added: i really hope they have things in place for the next year to make sure that part of the whole contest, especially mentally, gets taken care of. because i did feel alone and i know that some other artists were also feeling that way.israel's eden golan was protected by armed police throughout her preparations for eurovisionin a statement, the ebu  it was very mindful of the experiences of several artists at this year's contest. the process of dealing internally with individual incidents is ongoing and we are determined to ensure all rules are applied fairly and consistently, it . it  an independent consultation had resulted in recommendations, including developing a duty of care protocol for people participating in the contest. we believe these will help address many of the issues in malmö and help everyone, no matter their role, to have a positive and safe experience at the eurovision song contest.pop star olly alexander represented the uk in this year's contestin march, nemo, the uk's olly alexander and seven other eurovision contestants shared a statement, external in which they rejected calls to boycott the competition over the gaza war. asked why they made the decision to compete, nemo  they believe the contest fundamentally has good intentions. i made friends from all over europe and i would say i made very meaningful connections with other artists from places i've never been before, listening to music i've never heard before, getting to know people that are different to you. always i think that's a very good thing, they . at the core of this contest, i think it's an exchange of different cultures and coming together and i really believe in that sentiment.eric saade wore a symbol of pro-palestinian protest during this year's semi-finalthis year's eurovision was more fraught than usual. israel, which has taken part in the contest since 1973, had to change the lyrics of its entry after the original version broke rules on political neutrality because it was thought to reference the hamas attacks of 7 october 2023. at the event, there were backstage tensions between the israeli delegation and some other countries, which israel later  amounted to an unprecedented display of hatred. meanwhile, during the semi-finals, former swedish winner eric saade performed in the half-time slot with a palestinian keffiyeh scarf wrapped around his wrist. and in the build-up to the grand final, ireland's contestant withdrew from a dress rehearsal after complaining about israeli tv of coverage of their performance; and france's singer broke with protocol in the dress rehearsal by interrupting his song to make an impassioned speech about peace. separately, the dutch entry was disqualified because of an alleged confrontation with a female camera operator. although the rows did partly overshadow their win, nemo added that they stayed focused on telling their story, because it was - and i'm still convinced it is - an important story to tell. knowing that it had an impact, and a lot of people found something in that, and a lot of people gained something from that, especially young queer people, that makes me really happy.nemo has realised the scale of what their win meant to a lot of peoplenemo, who was 24 at the time of the contest, became the first non-binary artist to win eurovision. fittingly, they wrote the winning song, the code, to explain how they came to terms with their identity. the victory represented a big moment for the lgbtq community which has, for a long time, treated eurovision as a safe haven. it was only right after eurovision that i started to realise the scale of what this moment meant to a lot of people, nemo . they  their win sparked a wider discussion in their own home country, including around offering a third gender option on passports - something switzerland has so far resisted. but they also felt the win gave a lot of queer people hope and feeling understood and finally seen. i didn't grow up with a non-binary person to look up to. i think we've recently had these role models come up, they added. i'm really grateful even to be a part of this moment in time.nemo, who grew up in switzerland, has been living in berlin for the past few years and recently moved to london. they  the inspiration for their new single, eurostar, came as they took the train from paris to the uk capital in july. at that time, i was in the craziest phase of post-eurovision madness, that was every day [having] no sleep, going to the next stop, and i felt the train incorporated all of that. i wanna dance, i wanna party, do it likе no one before, nemo sings on a track that is all about living life in the moment and getting carried away in the music. they  the song was also a metaphor for their arrival in london, a city they described as inspiring.nemo described the experience of eurovision as one of crazy ups and downs. i was a swiss-based artist that a few people from switzerland knew and suddenly you have eyes all around you from all around the world, they . for now, they're focusing on making music and enjoying the moment. but can they turn their victory into lasting fame? some eurovision winners clearly have - such as swedish pop band abba and italian band måneskin. most, however, do not. i don't know if my goal is to become abba, they . i think the goal for me is to find my own voice. as for the uk's own eurovision hopes, after alexander received the dreaded 'nul points' from the public this year, nemo has the following advice. i would say to any artist that's thinking of going to eurovision, i would just do it, and i believe olly really did that, they . do it if you feel like you're going to enjoy it, and you're going to enjoy it no matter what the result is.

's glenn campbell: i want to show what it like living with a brain tumour warning: this video contains scenes which some viewers may find distressingas i waited for brain surgery, i instinctively pressed record on my phone camera, thinking i might be documenting the final months of my life. i have made a career telling other people stories but this seemed like a time to tell my own. it began with a bicycle crash in june 2023 when i broke 10 ribs - but that led to me discovering a much bigger health challenge. in bed one night, i had a seizure which revealed a cancerous brain tumour. the most likely scenario seemed to be that i had an aggressive glioblastoma, a tumour which typically ends your life within 12 to 18 months. in my hospital bed, i turned the camera on myself, not as a self-indulgence, but to spotlight a nasty cancer that hard to treat and even harder to beat. i suppose this was my way of extracting some purpose from a personal tragedy.glenn wants to give an insight into living with an incurable cancerthe result is my brain tumour and me - a tv and iplayer film that is far more optimistic than you might think. after 15 months i’m still going strong because it turns out i have a rare form of the disease, an oligodendroglioma, that tends to respond better to treatment. the brilliant brain surgeon paul brennan saved my life by chopping out most of my tumour and, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, it seems to be keeping my cancer in check for now. there are quarterly scans to see if it growing again. there have been a couple of false alarms but the most recent check suggests my tumour is stable. i have no idea how long that will last. i try not to worry too much between scans because what my brain tumour is up to is not within my control. what i have been learning to deal with are the difficult legacies of my cancer treatment - persistent fatigue and the risk of further seizures.glenn with (left to right) his sister lorna, his mum jennifer and his wife clairea daily nap and careful budgeting of my time and effort help with the fatigue. adjustments to anti-seizure medication have minimised the frequency and severity of any fits. it has taken time, trial and error to get that right. in december last year i had a very big seizure which put me in intensive care. a medically-induced coma was the only way doctors could make it stop. when i came round i felt extremely lucky to be alive - but the euphoria i had experienced after brain surgery was absent. this time, i felt as if i had only narrowly escaped death. it had all been a bit too close for comfort. i was very emotional. this was, and remains, the lowest point in my experience of living with brain cancer. but i bounced back and further tweaks to my epilepsy drugs gave me enough confidence to return to the hills i love so much.glenn and his friend nikolaj before they set off to climb meall nan tarmachanrarely do i feel more alive than when i’m on top of one of scotland's magnificent mountains. by march this year, i felt well enough to climb one without any sense of foreboding. the specialists are clear - they don’t want to stop me doing things. they want to enable me to live as normally as possible. in preparation for my climb up meall nan tarmachan, on the banks of loch tay, i had successfully scaled another mountain the weekend before with no problems. so when my friend nikolaj and i strode out from the ben lawers car park to climb the perthshire peak we had no concerns. within 10 minutes - before we’d really begun our ascent - i suddenly had to lie down. it wasn’t long before my left hand and arm were twitching and shaking uncontrollably. i was having another seizure.glenn had a seizure shortly after starting the climbit is very frustrating to feel perfectly well and then to be immobilised by epilepsy. fits are also physically exhausting. if i had thought there was much chance of this happening that day, i would have stayed at home. this is one of only four big seizures i have ever had. the others happened in bed, at work and in a hospital car park. nikolaj and other walkers made me comfortable on the hill and i was given the medication i carry with me. there was an impressive response from the emergency services and i imagined recovering on the hillside then walking slowly back to the car park.glenn was taken to hopsital on a coastguard helicopterat times, the professionals attending to me on the mountainside were not sure if things were getting better or worse so they decided to have me winched aboard a coastguard helicopter and taken to hospital. i would like to thank everyone who was there for me that day. i am extremely grateful. the seizure had stopped by the time i got to a&e in glasgow. i was soon calling friends and family to work out the best way home to east lothian. while on the hill, i had persuaded my walking companion to film some of the drama on his phone. at first, he was uncomfortable with this request but when i explained that i wanted to show what having a seizure was like, he agreed. his camerawork is some of the footage which features in my brain tumour and me - my attempt to give an insight into living with an incurable cancer that is not well understood. my wife claire and my mum jennifer also described the impact that such a devastating diagnosis can have on your family. glenn's mother  his determination has helped her to copei am very lucky. i am defying the typical odds. six in 10 people with brain cancer do not live for more than a year beyond their diagnosis. i may be around for some years yet. if i have a wobble, i know i can count on the love and support of my family and friends. i’ve found that more overwhelming and humbling than being confronted with my own mortality. i also have a wonderful network of fellow brain tumour patients, including my friend theo burrell, to help me through.glenn has been undergoing chemotherapy as part of his treatmentthat important because sometimes only someone with a similar condition can really understand. the medical care i have had from nhs doctors and nurses in edinburgh has been exceptional. my recovery is allowing me to make a gradual return to work covering politics for  scotland. that helps me stay positive, as does the personal effort i put into brain power - a fundraising community i set up to help establish a new brain tumour research centre in scotland.no-one can tell me how i got my tumour and no-one can fix it. i think well resourced science can do a lot better. if not for me, for those who come after. in my case, there has been no need for medical help with seizures since the airlift in march. after four months off the mountains, my walking boots are back on. my personal challenge is to climb all 282 munros - scottish mountains above 3,000ft - by the end of 2028. despite all my health problems since last summer, i have completed my first nine, including meall nan tarmachan second time around. that is a start.glenn climbing stùc an lochain with his dog ruadhthere been a lot of dog walking and a little bit of running and cycling too. in june, around the anniversary of my bike crash, i returned to the route i was on when i took a tumble. i called at the café i had been heading for that day and enjoyed the breakfast i had been denied the year before. never before has french toast with bacon and maple syrup tasted so good. i am now starting to think about how to celebrate my 50th birthday in 2026 - 15 months from now. it not so long since i thought i would not be around to mark that milestone. now, the half century seems within reach. if you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit  action line.my brain tumour and me - glenn campbell faces down his mortality and considers what matters most in life. you can watch the programme on  one scotland at 19:00 on wednesday 20 november or on the iplayer.

from pub job and playstation to writing an award-winning playnathan queeley-dennis  he, like his character, was lost in a cloud of where i was headed in lifeone day when nathan queeley-dennis was supposed to be busy lugging beer kegs in the cellar of the pub where he worked, he was instead writing his first script on his phone. it went on to win britain's biggest playwriting prize, is now on tour, and is being turned into a tv show. a morning shift at the birmingham pub where queeley-dennis had worked since he was 16 would often involve lifting and carrying that day's deliveries. for that task, his bosses allowed a couple of hours. you can do it in two hours, he . but i've always been pretty strong, so i knew i could do it in about 15-20 minutes if i really hustled. then i could just sit on my phone downstairs in the cellar, have a drink, have my breakfast and, like, chill. and in 2018, he used the downtime to bash out the opening scene of a script on his notes app. four years later, bullring techno makeout jamz won the prestigious bruntwood prize for playwriting. the year after that, it got glowing reviews at the edinburgh fringe. now, it's just kicked off a national tour in queeley-dennis's home city - which looms large in the story - and has been snapped up by a tv production company headed by peaky blinders mastermind steven knight.the guardian praised his light-footed charm [and] sure comic timing in edinburghafter finishing drama school, queeley-dennis was trying to make it as an actor when he started looking for a solo script to perform in a monologue competition. but he couldn't find anything that suited him as a young, black brummie, he . hence he holed up in the pub cellar to write his own. his short monologue introduced a hugely likeable young man called nathaniel, who is eternally optimistic about finding love despite none of his many dates ever working out. queeley-dennis received good feedback but didn't win the competition. he went back to working in the pub, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. one time i was playing on my playstation and i was like, i've been playing fifa and pro evolution soccer for about 15 years, and i thought, i feel absolutely nothing right now. so i just put it down. he opened his laptop, typed up the script from his phone, and kept on writing. in the space of an hour and a half, i had 10 pages of dialogue, and i looked and i finished, and i'd never felt so alive in my whole entire life. looking back on it, i think i was just yearning for some sort of creative release. i think i had so much creative energy, and i never used it.queeley-dennis eventually expanded the story into a full show. we learn that the character nathaniel studied fine art and dreams of being a hybrid, edgy, sexy kind of brum town basquiat with a garnish of banksy, but is in fact stuck working in a call centre. the plot isn't autobiographical, the 29-year-old , but the themes are. i'm not good at art. i've never worked a day in a call centre in my life. but have i spent time working in a job that i maybe felt was unfulfilling just to try and get by? yes. did it eat away at my soul? yes. and did i waste my time putting my energy into things that weren't what i actually wanted to do, because i was lost in a cloud of where i was headed in life? one hundred per cent. so i always say the emotional journey of the character is very truthful. but actually, a lot of people at any point in their 20s have felt those feelings - that thing of, ok, you're out in the world now, and what am i going to do?the show had a run at london's royal court after the edinburgh fringein 2023, queeley-dennis took bullring techno makeout jamz to edinburgh, where the stage's critic , external shows do not get much more exuberant or entertaining than this, and whatsonstage , external it positively brims with good humour and warmth. the guardian described it, external as a refreshingly healthy portrait of masculinity, which queeley-dennis performs with such light-footed charm, sure comic timing and sweet sense of male romanticism that he has the audience in his hands. it's premature to predict that it will follow fleabag and baby reindeer as a one-person fringe comedy-drama that becomes a tv hit, but it could well end up on that trajectory. the screen rights were snapped up by the kudos knight production stable, and a series is being pitched to commissioners. knight is on a mission to build on the success of peaky blinders by bringing through more birmingham talent and stories. queeley-dennis similarly believes the city has been neglected on stage and screen. i just feel like people shy away or pretend birmingham doesn't exist. we see things set in manchester, we see things set in yorkshire, we see things set in london, he . i just think it's the best city in the world and there's such a specific energy and verve and humour that we have. everyone here has a certain humour, a certain attitude and mindset and chip on the shoulder we all share. every city has its own different nuances. i think birmingham does, and more stories need to honour that and show that.perhaps the city is not as forward about bigging itself up as somewhere like manchester. i think people from birmingham just get on with things to ourselves, queeley-dennis agrees. over the last two years, i've had to get a lot better at talking myself up. yeah, we might need to talk ourselves up more. honestly, there are so many great artists in the city. he's more comfortable talking with pride about the friends he would hang out with at creative events six or seven years ago, and who are now, like him, making their breakthroughs. there is a community of us, and now we've all branched out into different mediums of work, he . there are actors on netflix shows, writers like myself, artistic directors of long-standing companies, and producers and stuff like that. we were just hanging out back in 2017-18 all together. he namechecks actors including corey weekes and keiren hamilton-amos, screenwriter ameir brown, and women & theatre artistic director adaya henry. there are so many names. i do think there is a mini creative renaissance within the city, and artists from the city that people maybe aren't aware of yet. but i think in a few years' time, we'll all be all over the place, and i'm trying to just be a part of that. bullring techno makeout jamz is at birmingham hippodrome until saturday, 5 october, then on tour throughout october and november.

emma and james richardson say they found themselves haemorrhaging money after buying a holiday homewhen james and emma richardson bought a £110,000 caravan at a holiday park in lincolnshire, they hoped it would benefit their whole family. the couple, from cleethorpes, used money left to s richardson by her parents – who died in 2017 and 2018 – to put down a £25,000 deposit and entered into a finance agreement to pay for the rest. they wanted to let relatives use the caravan at tattershall lakes for free holidays and also rent it out to the public to offset the cost. s richardson, 43, : i wanted to do something for the family. it was my way of being able to have them gain from me inheriting. mum and dad were very hard-working, very loving. family was everything.the richardsons  a tattershall lakes salesperson assured them they would make enough income from hiring out their caravan to cover their monthly finance repayments of £1,269. away resorts, which runs the park and manages rentals, denies any such promise was made. a spokesperson  the  the company was clear with caravan owners that there are no guarantees about subletting income. the richardsons  they found themselves haemorrhaging money after buying their caravan. we had months where we were taking £1,200 in rental costs, but we would only receive £200 of that because of linen charges, [visitor] passes, cleaning fees,   richardson, 46. we were so far short of what we were sold.emma and james richardson lost more than £50,000 over two yearsthe couple soon decided to cut their losses and offered to sell their caravan back to the park. after this offer was rejected, the richardsons paid £20,000 and handed over their caravan to get out of their third-party finance agreement. we lost, over a period of two years, in excess of £50,000, which has just crippled us,  richardson . i'm still paying credit cards off now. we've lost that inheritance that our parents worked all their lives for. s richardson  losing the money her parents had left was a bitter pill to swallow. she added: if it was just my money it would be completely different, but because it what my parents worked for… i felt like i’d let them down.skipsea in east yorkshire is home to hundreds of holiday caravanssince a boom in the 1960s, caravan holidays at britain's seaside resorts and rural beauty spots have been a popular choice among families looking for an affordable getaway. today there are more than 3,000 parks across the uk. caravan and camping holidays brought £7.2bn into the economy last year,  industry figures. the british holiday and home parks association (bhhpa), the national trade body for the sector,  these sites bring vital tourism and investment to some of the uk most economically challenged areas. the national caravans council (ncc), which also represents the industry,  there were many thousands of happy holiday caravan owners across the uk. but the richardsons are not the only family to feel they have been left out of pocket by the dream of owning a holiday home. dozens of people have  the  they lost significant sums of money – some of them their life savings, pensions or inheritance – after buying a static caravan. the founder of a group set up to support caravan owners  it was scandalous that people's lives are being ruined.andrew and sue dawson bought a static caravan at a holiday park on the east yorkshire coast in 2022, they planned to spend their retirement whiling away weekends at the seaside with their daughters and grandchildren. then they received some devastating news. in february this year,  dawson, 59, was diagnosed with incurable cancer. the doctors gave me between six months and – as they described it – a few short years, he . obviously we started talking about the future. it completely changed everything. the couple, from leeds, began getting their affairs in order and decided to sell their caravan at parkdean's skipsea sands resort. but they were in for another shock. the three-bedroom caravan with decking, for which they had paid £62,400 in 2022, was worth just £17,000 two years later. we were gobsmacked,   dawson. no one ever  us we’d face that level of depreciation. the salesman sold us the dream, but didn't sell us the reality.andrew and sue dawson enjoyed spending time with their granddaughters at skipsea sandsparkdean website states that buying a holiday home isn't considered a financial investment, as holiday homes depreciate in value with age. but  dawson  a skipsea sands salesperson  him caravans pretty much hold their value. only when the dawsons came to sell, following the cancer diagnosis, did they realise they could recoup only a fraction of their expenditure. the couple reluctantly agreed to sell their caravan back to the park for £17,000 after negotiating with the sales team. but on the day the dawsons cleared out their caravan to finalise the sale, parkdean cut the price they were willing to pay to £16,000.andrew dawson was diagnosed with stage four cancer in february dawson  his dealings with the park had been dreadful. the amount of money we've lost and the way we’ve been treated, in my opinion is very underhanded and lacking in transparency, he added. he  he felt there had been a complete lack of empathy, really, knowing my condition, knowing why were selling – that we didn't really have a lot of choice. we feel they let us down very badly.the dawsons paid £62,000 for their caravan with additional deckingafter the  contacted parkdean, a skipsea sands manager called  dawson and offered to pay him £1,000 to resolve the dispute. a parkdean spokesperson  the company was aware of and sympathetic to andrew situation and had contacted  dawson to agree a suitable offer and settle the matter. but  dawson  it was never about the money, adding: it doesn't change my view on parkdean and it doesn't change my view on the industry.sally nicholls, 70, from sheffield, used her entire pension pot and a small loan to buy a £69,000 static caravan at tattershall lakes in 2021. she  she  a salesperson she planned to live off the rental income in her retirement and was given figures indicating what she could expect to make. at the time, it looked like a good proposition, she added. ms nicholls did make a small profit from her caravan in her first year as an owner, but her takings quickly dried up after repeated increases in park charges, which she was forced to pass on to customers. she then found herself in competition with the park itself, which was able to offer more favourable rates, including free access to facilities, to prospective guests. that more or less put a complete halt to the bookings coming in, ms nicholls .sally nicholls sold her house after losing money on a caravan purchasems nicholls decided to sell her caravan but, like the dawsons, was shocked at how little it was now worth. after tattershall lakes declined to buy it back, she ended up selling to an outside trader for £17,500. it came as quite a shock to realise that i wasn’t going to get my pension back to live on in old age,  ms nicholls, who has since sold her house to free up funds for her retirement and moved to a smaller property in bolsover. i had to consider what i was going to live on, she added. the only option for me was to sell my home. away resorts  it provided all prospective buyers with comprehensive information, including detailed terms and conditions to ensure they had full awareness of the potential risks and rewards. a spokesperson added: while subletting a holiday home can be a way for some owners to generate additional income, we make it clear that there are no guarantees in relation to this, as various factors – including seasonal demand and wider economic conditions – can influence returns.ibraheem dulmeer, a barrister who specialises in holiday park law,  caravan buyers were not always fully informed about the agreements they were signing. he  it was really, really essential buyers did due diligence and got any promises from salespeople in writing. many people from the outset are not provided with any legal advice or don’t obtain any legal advice, they simply go through shaking hands, handing over large sums of money,  dulmeer added. and what seems to happen is that, as a result of that, they aren’t actually afforded the opportunity to review the terms, review the conditions, and see whether it fits for them. and that where most of the problems really stem from.the bhhpa, which represents holiday parks,  it was important consumers read the small print and fully understand the sales contract before committing to buying a caravan. a spokesperson for the ncc, the trade organisation for the industry,  holiday caravan ownership was a significant purchase decision and potential buyers should conduct their own research to fully understand what they are buying. they added: we work with our member parks to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities to help consumers understand clearly what they are buying, when and how they can use their holiday caravan or lodge, and that they treat all customers fairly and honestly using simple language and following best practice. caravan owners are protected by consumer rights laws, which are enforced by the competition and markets authority (cma) and local trading standards offices. the cma, a government regulator,  the  it could not comment on specific cases, but  businesses must not mislead their customers and any claims about products must be honest and transparent.last year, a petition signed by more than 27,000 people, which called for protections to be strengthened, was rejected by the conservative government. the petition was started by the holiday park action group, which has more than 66,000 members in a facebook group in which caravan buyers voice complaints. its founder carole keeble  consumers were consistently misled in respect of the true value of the caravans they are buying and claimed the cma was failing to act. she  the  it was a national scandal that people are losing their pensions, inheritance or having to sell their own homes to cover the losses they are incurring. meanwhile, ms nicholls  she wanted a regulator to step up and take control of the sector. she added: it's had a devastating impact on me. it's changed my life, basically. listen to highlights from hull and east yorkshire on  sounds, watch the latest episode of look north or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here,

'i felt broken until my autism diagnosis at 70'until he turned 70, andrew was one of the estimated 90% of autistic people over 50 who are undiagnosedall his life andrew davies has had a sense of not fitting in, that he was somehow broken, weird or there was something wrong with him. that was until he discovered he was autistic at the age of 70. it's just who i am and how my brain is wired... how i experience the world is just different, he . research has suggested that like andrew, there are many others who have spent a lifetime not knowing they are on the autistic spectrum, external. between 250,000 and 600,000 people over the age of 50 in england may be autistic but undiagnosed, a study of primary care records in england, external has suggested. that would mean more than 90% of autistic people over 50 were undiagnosed, its researchers have . autism was seen for many years as a childhood condition but it's a lifelong condition and as people get older they remain autistic,  andrew.andrew had a career in politics before retiring in 2019andrew, now 72, retired in 2019 following a long and impressive career. he was a minister for the first 10 years of the welsh government and the assembly member (now known as member of the senedd, or ms,) for swansea west from 1999 to 2011. after standing down from the assembly he was chairman of what was then abertawe bro morgannwg university health board for six years. perhaps not the most obvious line of work for someone who  they have often struggled understanding and dealing with other people. i can be in a group and it's keeping up with conversations, knowing what to say... it's not knowing the rules of small talk,  andrew, who lives in mount pleasant, swansea. from childhood he preferred being alone and one-on-one friendships to groups. this became harder to deal with in secondary school. i just completely struggled really, he . i felt there was something broken, there was something weird, something wrong. he found the social rules and structure of working life easier to navigate but would often feel bombarded and peopled out by the end of a long day. i suspect people may have thought 'oh he's pretty standoffish' but it's a combination of shyness and not knowing what to say, he .discos and rock concerts i never really enjoyed, i found the sound for example and the lights almost overwhelming and uncomfortable, he . other sounds, be it his wife popping chewing gum or a neighbour's dog barking, and some smells, such as congealed fat or grease, and sights such as fluorescent lights, have always made him very uncomfortable. i just have to get away, he . you try to ignore it but it's a physical, visceral reaction. something that has always served him well in work he now knows to be another trait of autism - intense interests, also known as hyperfixations., external he  he often became preoccupied with a topic he was interested in, throwing himself into intense research. i want to really get to know that issue in depth whereas most people will think 'that's interesting' and move on, he . he  researching autism had become yet another rabbit hole i've disappeared down.it was this tendency to become overly engaged in topics that he first identified as a possible autistic trait in himself. he was chatting to a colleague who had recently been diagnosed with autism. the colleague  he had been working with a consultant psychiatrist who took him to one side and : i hope you don't mind me saying this but you've got all the classic signs of autism. seeing a parallel between the colleague's detailed research and long emails and his own the penny dropped. andrew started reading and listening to podcasts about autism and decided to take the online questionnaire designed by psychologist prof simon baron-cohen. i came out very firmly in the middle of the spectrum, he . he then decided to seek a formal diagnosis, discovered the nhs waiting was three to four years so in the end went private.andrew has always had intense interests and likes to find out as much as he can about a topicwhat does having a diagnosis mean to him? it was just having that confirmation really... i wasn't broken or weird, or something wrong, it's just who i am and how my brain is wired, he . when you get to this age you look back on your life, from role to soul. i think it helps you come to terms with things that have happened in your life. andrew has experienced depression since he was a teenager - research suggests, external autistic people may be more likely to experience depression than non-autistic people,  national autistic society. he has also experienced periods of ill health which he now believes to be autistic burnout, external.andrew lives in swansea with his wifefigures suggest people over 50 are not being diagnosed with autism at anywhere near the rate of children - one in 34 children have an autism diagnosis compared with only 1 in 6,000 adults over 50, external. there's likely to be a very large underserved population who deserve to have the support they need,  dr gavin stewart, a research fellow at king's college london, who is interested in ageing and autism spectrum disorders. he  one reason for older people going undiagnosed was in the '60s, when they were in their youth, autism was viewed as a very rare condition whereas today it is viewed in a far more common way and the prevalence rates reflect that. he  for many older people receiving a diagnosis was a lightbulb moment and meant they could better understand their life experiences and it also opened doors for help and support, for instance from employers or those providing residential care. he would like clinicians working in older adult services to be more able to recognise undiagnosed autistic people. we know that autistic people often need additional help and support throughout their lives to support them with their mental health and ensure they're living happy lives, he . having the right help and support could be a real key factor in ensuring that they're ageing well and i think that everyone is entitles to have the best life that they can.information and support about autism is available via  action line.

much of the supporting cast of threads were people from the sheffield areaone of the most terrifying programmes ever shown on british television, threads is the nuclear apocalypse drama-documentary that continues to haunt people nightmares 40 years on. ahead of a rare new showing on the , here a look at how the drama still has the potential to terrify people. first broadcast on 23 september 1984, anyone who tuned in to  two on that sunday evening would experience a bleak and unforgettable depiction of a massive nuclear bomb attack on a british city and its aftermath. it was a nightmare scenario that was all too plausible in an era of heightened tension between the west and the then soviet union. rarely seen on television since its first broadcast, it's being shown again on  four and iplayer on 9 october. sheffield was chosen as the fictional nuclear target because its writer, kes author barry hines, lived there. ahead of transmission, about 600 people from the area who volunteered to work as extras were invited to a private viewing of the film. some were involved with amateur dramatics while others just thought it might be a bit of fun. maybe they could spot themselves or their friends on television. no one was expecting anything quite like this. 1984: look north interviews some of the extras who have just watched threadsone young woman  the  look north news programme: when i was doing it, it was just a good laugh, you know? i didn't really think about what it would likely be like to see it, and when you see it it's a lot different - it's very disturbing. another woman, trying to hold back tears, : i didn't think i would have reacted like this but i just couldn't help it. there's just going to be nothing after, is there? nothing. named threads because of the strands that bind life together in a large city, it covered the events leading up to the attack and the 13 horrendous years after it, as seen through the lives of two families, the kemps and the becketts. their attempts to survive after the attack make for harrowing viewing, with society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in. another woman who appeared as an extra  that while she was watching the drama she thought everybody's going to get out of it like all the other films, but threads offered no hope. i want to die when it hits me because i don't want to live through anything they lived through, not at all - it was horrible, she added.the effect of a nuclear attack on sheffield was calculated precisely by the makers of threads, whose director mick jackson had previously worked on the grim 1982  documentary, qed: a guide to armageddon. such a one-megaton airburst would create shockwaves causing severe damage to buildings up to nine miles away. much of the following morning breakfast time was given over to discussing the issues raised by the programme. showing impeccable timing, boy george was on as a guest to promote culture club new single the war song, with its catchy war is stupid chorus. he : a lot of people see war programmes as something really glamorous, so i think it about time they did see things that show it for what it is. threads extras norma and debbie neath talk about the experience on breakfast timebreakfast time reporter paul burden spoke to another two women who signed up as extras, only to receive a brutal first-hand lesson in the realities of life after the bomb. for norma neath and her daughter debbie who lived on the outskirts of sheffield in the village of coal aston, in the event of such an attack the chance of instant death would be only one in 20. debbie  on the day of filming, it started off as a laugh but by the end it became a bit too real. she : they'd got all people laid out with horrible wounds and nasty things, and we were freezing cold and beginning to feel how we probably would really feel if we were in that situation. writer barry hines  it was not their intention merely to shock like it was a horror film. it's just that it's such a shocking subject that there's some very harrowing scenes in it, and so there's no way that we could avoid shocking the audience, he .karen meagher and reece dinsdale played the young couple at the centre of the family drama before the bomb dropped threads creators barry hines and mick jackson explain why they tackled the subject in this way, on pebble mill at oneon the day after the threads broadcast, hines and jackson also appeared on pebble mill at one to deliver a sobering message for viewers of the cosy lunchtime magazine programme. hines  his main reason for making threads was to get people thinking about nuclear weapons, as a lot of people don’t know anything about it. jackson  many people had the misconception that a nuclear bomb meant a flash and a bang and it's all over. he added: i think threads might have shown those people that in fact, in even the severest worst scenario for a nuclear war that you can imagine, more people are going to survive than perish immediately, and that sort of long, drawn-out suffering is something that most people would have to go through if it happens. journalist john tusa introduces the broadcast of threads on  twolater on, newsnight was given over to a special debate featuring a panel of military and strategic experts from britain and the us, along with representatives from the three main parties. three questions were under discussion:• none can nuclear escalation be controlled so that it stops well short of mass destruction and the nuclear winter?• none what lessons can be drawn about britain's civil defence programme and its ability to provide either for the aftermath of a mass nuclear attack or the prospect of nuclear winter?• none what effect does the nuclear winter hypothesis have on nuclear deterrence and our readiness to rely on nuclear weapons as a key element of defence? threads has since become cult viewing, although it has been rarely broadcast on the  in the following 40 years. director mick jackson will introduce a fresh showing on  four and  iplayer, at 22:00 bst on 9 october.at the time, television critics largely approved of the decision to show threads. herbert kretzmer of the daily mail  that recent programmes about nuclear weapons had showed the  confidently fulfilling its ancient role as a convener and focus of national debate. but he worried about the film's purpose. is there not a sense in which programmes like this, while seeking to alert the populace, succeed mainly in paralysing the will? in the times, peter ackroyd commented: it was not clear if the point of threads was to frighten or inform... they are not incompatible aims, although i suspect they come under the larger heading of entertainment. sean french in the sunday times wrote: by the end we were a little better informed and a lot more worried. answers were as far away as ever. experts and interested parties give their reaction to threads, on did you seea week after threads was broadcast, the television review programme did you see sought a range of views from people with a professional interest in the subject. bruce kent of the campaign for nuclear disarmament felt that at the end it could have given people a bit more positive direction about the sorts of things they could actually do. he : let me emphasise straight away, nobody is going to start chucking 5,000 megatons around this planet. nobody, neither the russians, the americans, the british, the french, or anybody else. it will simply never happen. one of those who watched the film at a formative age was black mirror writer charlie brooker, who was 13 in 1984. he  desert island discs in 2018: i remember watching threads and not being able to process what that meant; not understanding how society kept going. he added: i assumed it [nuclear war] was going to happen and i think in the 1980s it did seem like that was going to happen. while the world has changed in so many ways since threads was first broadcast, it retains its harrowing power.

implying he would end the israel-hamas war in gaza and the israel-hezbollah war in lebanon - but has not  how. he has repeatedly  that, if he had been in power rather than joe biden, hamas would not have attacked israel because of his maximum pressure policy on iran, which funds the group. broadly, it likely trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the us out of the iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against iran and kill gen qasem soleimani - iran most powerful military commander. in the white house, trump enacted strongly pro-israel policies, naming jerusalem as israel capital and moving the us embassy there from tel aviv - a move which energised trump christian evangelical base, a core republican voter group. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called trump the best friend that israel has ever had in the white house. but critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. the palestinians boycotted the trump administration, because of washington abandonment of their claim to jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for palestinians. they were further isolated when trump brokered the so-called abraham accords, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between israel and several arab and muslim countries. they did so without israel having to accept a future independent palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.

the week that pushed the middle east closer to all-out warpeople evacuate a wounded man after an israeli strike in beirut on 4 octoberthere have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. this is the worst. in the past seven days, hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah has been assassinated, israel has launched a ground invasion of lebanon, and iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across israel. western and regional powers - led by the us - have pushed for de-escalation. the un security council called for an immediate end to hostilities and the g7, which includes the us, uk and germany, has called for restraint. but so far those efforts have failed - and the middle east stands closer than ever to all-out war. here how the last week played out.as the sun set over beirut on 27 september, the south of the city was hit by a series of huge explosions. several apartment buildings had been struck, leaving a huge crater in the ground. plumes of dust and debris filled the skyline, visible from across the lebanese capital. the strike, aimed at an underground bunker, killed hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah. seen as a prize-target, nasrallah had not been seen in public for years for fear of being assassinated by israel. his death capped a week of ramped-up israeli strikes targeting hezbollah that had left more than 500 people dead. the week before that, a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions targeting the group left at least 32 dead and over 3000 injured. nasrallah death wiped all hopes of a de-escalation, which just hours earlier had seemed possible. a us proposal for a 21-day ceasefire had been discussed on the sidelines of the united nations (un) general assembly in new york. israel un ambassador danny danon had even  his side was open to ideas. but hours after the strike, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu was on an early flight home from the un - and any lingering hopes of diplomacy prevailing faded away.three days later, israeli forces crossed into lebanon, marking the start of a ground invasion. the israel defense forces (idf)  its operations would be limited and targeted. fighting so far has driven nearly 1.2 million people from their homes,  lebanon crisis unit. at least 8 israeli soldiers have been killed. israel  the operation is aimed at stopping hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and drones over the border – something it has done on an almost daily basis since hamas, its palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern israel almost a year ago, triggering the current gaza war. now israeli troops are fighting a ground war on two fronts simultaneously: gaza and lebanon. that hasn’t happened in decades. the last war between israel and hezbollah, in 2006, ended inconclusively with un resolution 1701, which stipulated hezbollah withdrew its forces from southern lebanon. that never happened, and with iranian support, hezbollah grew in strength. israel has not  that it wants to remove hezbollah entirely from lebanon political landscape (as it has with hamas in gaza), but for all its talk of this being a limited and targeted operation, it clear that israel is ruthlessly determined to cut hezbollah down in size. spurred by an astonishing two and a half weeks, israel is in an ambitious frame of mind.the next day, at around 19:30 local time, 10 million israelis were sent running for bomb shelters across the country after iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at israel. the nation's air defence system sprang into action - and allies including the us and uk were involved in repelling the attack - another sign of the broadening scope of the conflict. the idf  most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern israel. the only person  to have been killed was a palestinian man in the occupied west bank. with its biggest proxy group in disarray, tehran calculated that to restore some semblance of deterrence it needed to do something more dramatic than its last well-telegraphed missile and drone attack on israel in april. hence the larger number of ballistic missiles and the lack of advance notice. but while the attack was more than purely demonstrative, it did not appear to signal iran desire for an all-out fight. that hardly surprising. if it came to a full-on war, iran knows that it would lose, and badly. it could even herald the end of the islamic republic. israel, with powerful western allies - and a smattering of middle eastern neighbours willing to help shoot down iranian missiles - is a regional superpower. iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match. nor does it have the sort of allies that would be willing to spring to its defence in the event of a confrontation. the supreme leader, ayatollah khamenei, made suitably defiant noises at friday prayers in tehran, but iran knows it cannot afford to escalate much further.despite hezbollah devastating losses, it has vowed to fight on in lebanon. and history shows us it is easy for israel to enter lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. as for israel response to iran, the region - and the world - has been on tenterhooks since tuesday. us president joe biden  he has discouraged israel from striking iranian nuclear or oil facilities as part of its retaliation. a severe reaction seems inevitable, though, and some of benjamin netanyahu recent rhetoric suggests that he might be thinking, ultimately, of regime change in iran. but israel immediate objectives are closer to home. total victory in gaza and removing the threat posed by hezbollah along the northern border. israeli leaders point out that they at war on many fronts. benjamin netanyahu  there are seven: gaza, lebanon, the west bank, yemen, iran, iraq and syria. it true that over the past year, attacks have come from all these directions, even though pro-iranian groups in iraq and syria have so far posed little real threat. we’re not seeing an all-out regional war just yet, but with so many players feeling they have a stake in it, the war in gaza has metastasised in a dramatic fashion.

and the middle east stands closer than ever to all-out war. here how the last week played out.as the sun set over beirut on 27 september, the south of the city was hit by a series of huge explosions. several apartment buildings had been struck, leaving a huge crater in the ground. plumes of dust and debris filled the skyline, visible from across the lebanese capital. the strike, aimed at an underground bunker, killed hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah. seen as a prize-target, nasrallah had not been seen in public for years for fear of being assassinated by israel. his death capped a week of ramped-up israeli strikes targeting hezbollah that had left more than 500 people dead. the week before that, a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions targeting the group left at least 32 dead and over 3000 injured. nasrallah death wiped all hopes of a de-escalation, which just hours earlier had seemed possible. a us proposal for a 21-day ceasefire had been discussed on the sidelines of the united nations (un) general assembly in new york. israel un ambassador danny danon had even  his side was open to ideas. but hours after the strike, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu was on an early flight home from the un -

and allies including the us and uk were involved in repelling the attack - another sign of the broadening scope of the conflict. the idf  most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern israel. the only person  to have been killed was a palestinian man in the occupied west bank. with its biggest proxy group in disarray, tehran calculated that to restore some semblance of deterrence it needed to do something more dramatic than its last well-telegraphed missile and drone attack on israel in april. hence the larger number of ballistic missiles and the lack of advance notice. but while the attack was more than purely demonstrative, it did not appear to signal iran desire for an all-out fight. that hardly surprising. if it came to a full-on war, iran knows that it would lose, and badly. it could even herald the end of the islamic republic. israel, with powerful western allies - and a smattering of middle eastern neighbours willing to help shoot down iranian missiles - is a regional superpower. iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match. nor does it have the sort of allies that would be willing to spring to its defence in the event of a confrontation. the supreme leader, ayatollah khamenei, made suitably defiant noises at friday prayers in tehran, but iran knows it cannot afford to escalate much further.despite hezbollah devastating losses, it has vowed to fight on in lebanon. and history shows us it is easy for israel to enter lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. as for israel response to iran, the region - and the world - has been on tenterhooks since tuesday. us president joe biden  he has discouraged israel from striking iranian nuclear or oil facilities as part of its retaliation. a severe reaction seems inevitable, though, and some of benjamin netanyahu recent rhetoric suggests that he might be thinking, ultimately, of regime change in iran. but israel immediate objectives are closer to home. total victory in gaza and removing the threat posed by hezbollah along the northern border. israeli leaders point out that they at war on many fronts. benjamin netanyahu  there are seven: gaza, lebanon, the west bank, yemen, iran, iraq and syria. it true that over the past year, attacks have come from all these directions, even though pro-iranian groups in iraq and syria have so far posed little real threat. we’re not seeing an all-out regional war just yet, but with so many players feeling they have a stake in it, the war in gaza has metastasised in a dramatic fashion.

iran leader  israeli attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed'iran's supreme leader ali khamenei has given a measured response to israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be exaggerated or downplayed while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation. president masoud pezeshkian  iran would give an appropriate response to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that tehran did not seek war. israel  it targeted military sites in several regions of iran on saturday in retaliation for iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards israel on 1 october. on sunday prime minister benjamin netanyahu  israel had crippled iranian air defence and missile production systems. he  the strikes had severely damaged iran defence capability and its ability to produce missiles.the attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals, netanyahu  at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 october attacks. this regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him. official iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems. in his first public comments since the attack, khamenei : it is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the iranian people to the israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country. president pezeshkian largely echoed the supreme leader's language, telling a cabinet meeting: we do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country. the israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. the us had publicly pressured israel not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by tel aviv. the iranian foreign minister  on sunday that iran had received indications about an impending attack hours before it took place. we had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night, abbas araghchi  reporters, without going into more detail. western countries have urged iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both middle eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war. iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the limited damage as a victory, a choice analysts  was intended to reassure iranians.fighting continued between israel and iran-backed hezbollah in lebanon and between israel and the palestinian armed group hamas in gaza. on sunday, an israeli air strike on the town of sidon in southern lebanon killed at least eight people,  local authorities. late on sunday lebanon  at least 21 people had been killed in israeli strikes on the south of the country. in gaza, nine people were killed in an israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the al-shati refugee camp, palestinians officials . palestinian media and the reuters news agency  three of the dead were palestinian journalists, citing government officials. and in israel, a man was killed and at least 30 injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an israeli military base north of tel aviv, in what authorities  was a suspected terror attack. egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi on sunday proposed a two-day ceasefire in gaza, which would involve an exchange of four israeli hostages for some palestinian prisoners. he  that within 10 days of implementing such a temporary ceasefire, talks should resume with the aim of reaching a more permanent one. but speaking to the 's arabic service, a senior hamas official  its conditions for a ceasefire - rejected by israel for months - have not changed. sami abu zuhri  the palestinian militant group continued to demand a complete ceasefire, a full israeli withdrawal from gaza and a serious prisoner swap deal. any agreement that does not guarantee these conditions holds no value, he added. israel launched a campaign to destroy hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. more than 42,924 people have been killed in gaza since then,  the territory's hamas-run health ministry.

operating and in the case of that strike as well, steps had been taken to mitigate civilian harm. the details of both incidents were under review, it . the lebanese health ministry  rescue workers were still searching the rubble after the strike in almat. israel has escalated its campaign against iran-backed lebanese armed group hezbollah. its main focus had been southern lebanon, aiming to weaken the group capacity to launch rockets across the border. but in recent weeks, operations have targeted cities and towns throughout lebanon. in a separate incident to the south, three medical workers were killed when an israeli strike hit an islamic health authority building in adloun, the health ministry .the strike on almat in northern lebanon killed 23 people, officials in a further update, the lebanese health ministry  in a statement on sunday that 53 people were killed on saturday, including 28 in the south and 17 in baalbek. the idf  it had intercepted hezbollah rockets on

scattered under the rubble, he . videos and images showed multiple bodies wrapped in blankets in the back of cars and laid to the ground at a hospital. another strike in gaza city killed a welfare ministry official and seven members of his family, including his wife and children, medics and relatives . israel is facing a us deadline that expires within days to improve the humanitarian situation in gaza or face potential restrictions on military cooperation. the un previously  the darkest moment of the war in gaza was unfolding in the northern part of the territory.the attack on the house in

attack targeted members of hezbollah. the uk-based monitoring group  the strike targeted the building where lebanese families and members of the movement live. there was no immediate comment from the idf, afp .on saturday, israel rejected warnings of famine in northern gaza from global food security experts, saying the group relied on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests. the independent famine review committee (frc)  there was a strong likelihood of imminent famine and that immediate action was required to ease a catastrophic situation. israel  it had increased aid efforts, including opening an additional crossing on friday to get more aid into southern gaza. the idf later  it had delivered 11 trucks of food, water and medical aid into jabalia and beit hanoun on thursday. meanwhile, efforts to reach a ceasefire have stalled, with qatar suspending its work as a mediator until hamas and israel show their willingness to negotiate.israel launched its current military offensive in gaza after hamas' attack on 7 october 2023 that killed about 1,200 people in israel and took 251 hostages back to gaza. gaza's hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the un sees as reliable, has  a death toll of more than 43,600 people since the start of the war. many more bodies are believed to remain under the rubble of bombarded buildings. in lebanon, israel went on the offensive against hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in gaza. israeli air strikes have eliminated most of the group leadership and caused widespread destruction in parts of southern and eastern lebanon and beirut southern suburbs - areas where hezbollah has a strong presence. israeli authorities say more than 70 people have been killed by hezbollah attacks in israel and the occupied golan heights over the past year.

bowen: iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weakisrael attack on iran deepens the war in the middle east. avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by iran supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei and his key advisors. they must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. at one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. at the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. the risk for iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by israel military power and political determination, backed up by the united states. in the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of iran islamic regime.iran official media in the hours before and after israel attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. its language resembles israel, citing its right to defend itself against attack. but the stakes are so high that iran might decide to walk its threats back. that is the hope of britain prime minister sir keir starmer, who fell in behind america insistence that israel has acted in self-defence. i am clear that israel has the right to defend itself against iranian aggression, he . i'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. iran should not respond. iran own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on israel on 1 october. a week ago, iran foreign minister abbas araghchi  turkey ntv network that any attack on iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. such an attack will not go unanswered. hours before the israeli strikes, the iranian foreign ministry spokesperson esmail baqai : any aggression by the israeli regime against iran will be met with full force. it was, he , highly misleading and baseless to suggest that iran would not respond to a limited israeli attack. as the israeli aircraft were heading back to base iran foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence as enshrined in article 51 of the un charter. a statement  iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.israel has set the pace of escalation since the spring. it sees iran as the crucial backer of the hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 october last year. fearing that israel was looking for a chance to strike, iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with israel. that did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on israel and its allies. the men in tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. instead, iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called axis of resistance to attack israel. the houthis in yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the red sea. hezbollah rocket fire from lebanon forced at least 60,000 israelis from their homes. six months into the war, israel retaliation forced perhaps twice as many lebanese from their homes in the south, but israel was prepared to do much more. it warned that if hezbollah did not hold its fire into israel and move back from the border it would take action. when that did not happen, israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by iran limited, but attritional war. it landed a series of powerful blows that threw the islamic regime in tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. that is why, after the latest israeli strikes, iranian leaders have only hard choices. israel interpreted iran reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on iran and its axis. prime minister benjamin netanyahu and israel commanders could afford to take risks. they had president joe biden unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant american sea and air reinforcements to the middle east to back up the us commitment to defend israel. on 1 april an israeli airstrike destroyed part of iran diplomatic compound in damascus, the syrian capital. it killed a top iranian commander, brig gen mohammed reza zahedi, along with other senior officers from the iran islamic revolutionary guard corps (irgc). the americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. but joe biden support did not waver as israel faced the consequences of its actions. on 13 april iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. most were shot down by israel defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the us, uk, france and jordan. biden apparently asked israel to take the win hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening middle east war. when israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, biden plan seemed to be working.about 1,200 people were killed in the 7 october hamas attack on israelbut since the summer, israel has repeatedly escalated the war with iran and its axis of allies and proxies. the biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against iran most important ally, hezbollah in lebanon. iran had spent years building up hezbollah arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. the idea was an israeli attack on iran would be deterred by the knowledge that hezbollah would hammer israel from just over the border in lebanon. but israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. it blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived hezbollah into buying, invaded south lebanon and killed hezbollah leader sheikh hasan nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to israel for decades. the authorities in beirut say that israel offensive in lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. hezbollah is still fighting and killing israeli soldiers inside lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. but it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. faced with the near collapse of its strategy, iran concluded it had to hit back. allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-israeli and anti-western forces in the region. its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on israel on 1 october. the airstrikes on friday 25 october were israel response. they took longer to come than many expected. leaks of israeli plans could have been a factor. israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern gaza. the un human rights chief volker turk has called it the darkest moment of gaza war, with the israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. it impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of israel attacks on iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern gaza. but it might have been part of the calculation.israel's iron dome air defence system intercepted most of iran's missile attack on 1 octoberit is hard to stop successive rounds of strikes and counter strikes when the countries concerned believe they will be seen as weak, and deterred, if they don’t respond. that is how wars spin out of control. the question now is whether iran is prepared to give israel the last word, at least on this stage of the war. president biden backed israel decision to retaliate after 1 october. but once again he tried to head off an even deadlier escalation, telling israel publicly not to bomb iran most important assets, its nuclear, oil and gas installations. he augmented israel defences by deploying the thaad anti-missile system to israel, and prime minister netanyahu agreed to take his advice. the american elections on 5 november are part of both israel and iran calculations about what happens next. if donald trump gets his second term, he might be less concerned than biden about answering iranian retaliation, if it happens, with strikes on nuclear, oil and gas facilities. once again, the middle east is waiting. israel decision not to hit iran most valuable assets might, perhaps, give tehran the chance to postpone a response, at least long enough for diplomats to do their work. at the un general assembly last month, the iranians were suggesting that they were open to a new round of nuclear negotiations. all this should matter greatly to the world outside the middle east. iran has always denied it wants a nuclear bomb. but its nuclear expertise and enrichment of uranium have put a weapon within its reach. its leaders must be looking for a new way to deter their enemies. developing a nuclear warhead for their ballistic missiles might be on their agenda.

a strike on an air defence site, biden plan seemed to be working.about 1,200 people were killed in the 7 october hamas attack on israelbut since the summer, israel has repeatedly escalated the war with iran and its axis of allies and proxies. the biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against iran most important ally, hezbollah in lebanon. iran had spent years building up hezbollah arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. the idea was an israeli attack on iran would be deterred by the knowledge that hezbollah would hammer israel from just over the border in lebanon. but israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. it blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived hezbollah into buying, invaded south lebanon and killed hezbollah leader sheikh hasan nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to israel for decades. the authorities in beirut say that israel offensive in lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. hezbollah is still fighting and killing israeli soldiers inside lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. but it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. faced with the near collapse of its strategy, iran concluded it had to hit back. allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-israeli and anti-western forces in the region. its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on israel on 1 october. the airstrikes on friday 25 october were israel response. they took longer to come than many expected. leaks of israeli plans could have been a factor. israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern gaza. the un human rights chief volker turk has called it the darkest moment of gaza war, with the israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. it impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of israel attacks on iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern gaza. but it might have been part of the calculation.israel's iron dome air defence system intercepted most of iran's missile attack on 1 octoberit is hard to stop successive rounds of strikes and counter strikes when the countries concerned believe they will be seen as weak, and deterred, if they don’t respond. that is how wars spin out of control. the question now is whether iran is prepared to give israel the last word, at least on this stage of the war. president biden backed israel decision to retaliate after 1 october. but once again he tried to head off an even deadlier escalation, telling israel publicly not to bomb iran most important assets, its nuclear, oil and gas installations. he augmented israel defences by deploying the thaad anti-missile system to israel, and prime minister netanyahu agreed to take his advice. the american elections on 5 november are part of both israel and iran calculations about what happens next. if donald trump gets his second term, he might be less concerned than biden about answering iranian retaliation, if it happens, with strikes on nuclear, oil and gas facilities. once again, the middle east is waiting. israel decision not to hit iran most valuable assets might, perhaps, give tehran the chance to postpone a response, at least long enough for diplomats to do their work. at the un general assembly last month, the iranians were suggesting that they were open to a new round of nuclear negotiations. all this should matter greatly to the world outside the middle east. iran has always denied it wants a nuclear bomb. but its nuclear expertise and enrichment of uranium have put a weapon within its reach. its leaders must be looking for a new way to deter their enemies. developing a nuclear warhead for their ballistic missiles might be on their agenda.
