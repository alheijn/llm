The region's new government has lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10 .
Example texts: 'adult crime, adult time': row as australian territory locks up 10-year-olds againa protest was held outside the northern territory's parliament in darwin as mps debated lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10'thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison. following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in australia northern territory (nt). he was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary. five years on, the aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out. it hard changing, thomas tells me. [breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it hard to [stop] the habit. his story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the northern territory. for many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. the northern territory is the part of australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average, external. it also more than twice the rate of the us, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. but the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. the move, which defies a un recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.business owner sunil kumar  his restaurant had five or six break-ins in the last year and is in favour of tougher lawsit's not just an issue of incarceration. it's one of inequalities too. while around 30% of the northern territory's population is aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are indigenous. so, aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. the country liberal party (clp) government  it has a mandate after campaigning to keep territorians safe. it helped the party claim a landslide victory in august's elections. among those voting for the clp was sunil kumar. the owner of two indian restaurants in darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. it's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun, explains  kumar. he  he improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. how come they are out and parents don't know? he . there should be a punishment for the parents. but while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. youth offender rates have risen since covid. last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. but the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the northern territory, australian bureau of statistics figures show. politicians, though, are playing to residents’ fears. as well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as declan's law, after declan laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. i never want another family to experience what we have,  his mother samara laverty. the passing of this legislation is a turning point for the territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place.on the day the laws started to be debated in darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. one woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. another asked: 'what if it was your child?' our young people in don dale need to have opportunity for hope,  aboriginal elder, aunty barb nasir, addressing the demonstrators. she was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. we need to always stand for them because they are lost in there, aunty barb . kat mcnamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill,  the crowd: the idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt. after a ripple of applause, she added: we are not going to stand for it. but with a large majority in parliament, the clp easily managed to pass the laws.protesters opposing the new law argue that jailing 10-year-olds is not a sustainable long-term solutionlowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. and while other australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the australian capital territory. australia is not alone – in england and wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. but in comparison, the majority of european union members make it 14, in line with un recommendations. the northern territory's chief minister, lia finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can intervene early and address the root causes of crime. we have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time, she  last month. and we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more. but for people like thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. his crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. he  he finds prison oddly comforting. it's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. most of my family has been in and out of jail. i felt like i was at home because all the boys took care of me. his two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. at one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now – his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. he's been helped by brother 2 another - an aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports first nations children caught up in the justice system.darren damaso, from the program brother 2 another,  there should be more investment in services to support young aboriginal peoplelocking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,  darren damaso, a youth leader for brother 2 another. there needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. and then we're going to slowly start to see change. but if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work.  damaso is from the larrakia aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of darwin, and he also has connections to the yanuwa and malak malak people. his organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. brother 2 another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. it's a self-perpetuating cycle,  john lawrence, a scottish criminal barrister who's been based in darwin for more than three decades. he's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. aboriginal people have no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm,   lawrence. the fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.the tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the northern territory. in queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the liberal national party played heavily on its slogan: adult crime, adult time. in a recent report by the australian human rights commission, anne hollonds, the national children commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them first nations children - the country is creating one of australia's most urgent human rights challenges. the systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps, she . we cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer. which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. what are the cultural strengths of people? what are the community strengths of people? we are building on that,  erin reilly, a regional director for children's ground. her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the aboriginal 'kinship’ system - how people fit in with their community and family. we centre indigenous world views and indigenous values and we work in a way that works for aboriginal people, explains ms reilly. we know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people. for thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. but on the outside, he , there little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. i felt like no one cared. nobody wanted to listen, he . he points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: so, i hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?

from pub job and playstation to writing an award-winning playnathan queeley-dennis  he, like his character, was lost in a cloud of where i was headed in lifeone day when nathan queeley-dennis was supposed to be busy lugging beer kegs in the cellar of the pub where he worked, he was instead writing his first script on his phone. it went on to win britain's biggest playwriting prize, is now on tour, and is being turned into a tv show. a morning shift at the birmingham pub where queeley-dennis had worked since he was 16 would often involve lifting and carrying that day's deliveries. for that task, his bosses allowed a couple of hours. you can do it in two hours, he . but i've always been pretty strong, so i knew i could do it in about 15-20 minutes if i really hustled. then i could just sit on my phone downstairs in the cellar, have a drink, have my breakfast and, like, chill. and in 2018, he used the downtime to bash out the opening scene of a script on his notes app. four years later, bullring techno makeout jamz won the prestigious bruntwood prize for playwriting. the year after that, it got glowing reviews at the edinburgh fringe. now, it's just kicked off a national tour in queeley-dennis's home city - which looms large in the story - and has been snapped up by a tv production company headed by peaky blinders mastermind steven knight.the guardian praised his light-footed charm [and] sure comic timing in edinburghafter finishing drama school, queeley-dennis was trying to make it as an actor when he started looking for a solo script to perform in a monologue competition. but he couldn't find anything that suited him as a young, black brummie, he . hence he holed up in the pub cellar to write his own. his short monologue introduced a hugely likeable young man called nathaniel, who is eternally optimistic about finding love despite none of his many dates ever working out. queeley-dennis received good feedback but didn't win the competition. he went back to working in the pub, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. one time i was playing on my playstation and i was like, i've been playing fifa and pro evolution soccer for about 15 years, and i thought, i feel absolutely nothing right now. so i just put it down. he opened his laptop, typed up the script from his phone, and kept on writing. in the space of an hour and a half, i had 10 pages of dialogue, and i looked and i finished, and i'd never felt so alive in my whole entire life. looking back on it, i think i was just yearning for some sort of creative release. i think i had so much creative energy, and i never used it.queeley-dennis eventually expanded the story into a full show. we learn that the character nathaniel studied fine art and dreams of being a hybrid, edgy, sexy kind of brum town basquiat with a garnish of banksy, but is in fact stuck working in a call centre. the plot isn't autobiographical, the 29-year-old , but the themes are. i'm not good at art. i've never worked a day in a call centre in my life. but have i spent time working in a job that i maybe felt was unfulfilling just to try and get by? yes. did it eat away at my soul? yes. and did i waste my time putting my energy into things that weren't what i actually wanted to do, because i was lost in a cloud of where i was headed in life? one hundred per cent. so i always say the emotional journey of the character is very truthful. but actually, a lot of people at any point in their 20s have felt those feelings - that thing of, ok, you're out in the world now, and what am i going to do?the show had a run at london's royal court after the edinburgh fringein 2023, queeley-dennis took bullring techno makeout jamz to edinburgh, where the stage's critic , external shows do not get much more exuberant or entertaining than this, and whatsonstage , external it positively brims with good humour and warmth. the guardian described it, external as a refreshingly healthy portrait of masculinity, which queeley-dennis performs with such light-footed charm, sure comic timing and sweet sense of male romanticism that he has the audience in his hands. it's premature to predict that it will follow fleabag and baby reindeer as a one-person fringe comedy-drama that becomes a tv hit, but it could well end up on that trajectory. the screen rights were snapped up by the kudos knight production stable, and a series is being pitched to commissioners. knight is on a mission to build on the success of peaky blinders by bringing through more birmingham talent and stories. queeley-dennis similarly believes the city has been neglected on stage and screen. i just feel like people shy away or pretend birmingham doesn't exist. we see things set in manchester, we see things set in yorkshire, we see things set in london, he . i just think it's the best city in the world and there's such a specific energy and verve and humour that we have. everyone here has a certain humour, a certain attitude and mindset and chip on the shoulder we all share. every city has its own different nuances. i think birmingham does, and more stories need to honour that and show that.perhaps the city is not as forward about bigging itself up as somewhere like manchester. i think people from birmingham just get on with things to ourselves, queeley-dennis agrees. over the last two years, i've had to get a lot better at talking myself up. yeah, we might need to talk ourselves up more. honestly, there are so many great artists in the city. he's more comfortable talking with pride about the friends he would hang out with at creative events six or seven years ago, and who are now, like him, making their breakthroughs. there is a community of us, and now we've all branched out into different mediums of work, he . there are actors on netflix shows, writers like myself, artistic directors of long-standing companies, and producers and stuff like that. we were just hanging out back in 2017-18 all together. he namechecks actors including corey weekes and keiren hamilton-amos, screenwriter ameir brown, and women & theatre artistic director adaya henry. there are so many names. i do think there is a mini creative renaissance within the city, and artists from the city that people maybe aren't aware of yet. but i think in a few years' time, we'll all be all over the place, and i'm trying to just be a part of that. bullring techno makeout jamz is at birmingham hippodrome until saturday, 5 october, then on tour throughout october and november.

 cardiff woman quits drinking over fear she would die by christmasafter an 18-hour bender that finished at 9am, the beer fear and anxiety got too much, and jessie hallett knew she had to quit drinking. for more than a decade, weeks would go by without a day of sobriety - but now the 29-year-old realised she had a problem, and may not make it to christmas if she didn't stop. new figures from drinkaware, external - a charity that works with the alcohol industry - show that 89% of drinkers in wales are using at least one technique to moderate their drinking. the statistics show a rise in 18 to 34 year olds who never binge drink, with more in the generation z age group turning to intermittent sobriety where they want to give up drinking at least for periods of time.i was burning the candles at both ends, i was working long days and instead of going home after those shifts i would go out after it,  jessie. i would drink the next day to avoid the hangover. then all of a sudden weeks go by and you realise you haven't had a day go by without a drink. jessie, who lives in cardiff,  she drank socially from a young age - but it's when she started working in hospitality she noticed her drinking habits changing, going out after shifts finished. then the pandemic hit, which made her drinking much worse. i was severely depressed at the time, my mental health was in the bin, she added. i was having panic attacks and anxiety and the only way to mask that was through drugs and alcohol.jessie uses her social media to raise awareness about sobrietythings came to a head on beaujolais day 2022 - a french event that toasts the wine harvest every november, that has become popular in wales. jessie : i'd gone on an 18-hour bender. i got home at nine in the morning after being out all day. the beer fear and anxiety was too much. after that moment, i knew. if i hadn't given up drinking, i wouldn't have made it to christmas. the next day she  friends and family, and their reaction made her realise she had made the right decision. not one person who was close to me questioned it,  jessie. that to me was alarm bells, everyone knew that was something i had to do.since going sober, jessie goes to the gym five or six times a week and has lost five stone in weightafter almost two years of being sober, her whole life has changed. i could never have imagined the life i'm living now. i was really unhealthy when i was drinking, she . i've lost five stone [31.75kg], i go to the gym five or six times a week, i have a new passion for fitness. i get up at 5am every day. my career has absolutely taken off, i haven't even had a cold since being sober. jessie runs a social media company and  it's quite ironic, because 90% of her clients are involved with alcohol. it empowers me that i can be around booze and the industry and say you don't have the power over me anymore, she .non-alcoholic events are becoming popular in the uk, especially with students. intermittent sobriety is the new buzz term among gen zs who want to give up drinking, but not completely. chris evans, 23, from aberaeron, ceredigion, has teamed up with business development service for cardiff, external to launch the my drink, my choice campaign. it aims to promote alternatives to evening activities centred around drinking, while normalising the decision to avoid alcohol. i come from a small town, and coming to cardiff it is easy to get into a culture of drinking alcohol, chris . i didn't even drink much until coming to university, it's easy to get swept up in it all.although chris still drinks he is aware of why people make the choice not to. international students who can't or choose not to drink alcohol didn't even cross my mind, he . events like this gives a chance to give somewhere safe for people to socialise and to be confident to be yourself.gp dr will mackintosh, who is based in st clears, carmarthenshire, believes younger people have better insight into how alcohol and binge drinking can affect them. traditionally, older people, when they think of alcohol abuse, they think of liver disease, he . but younger people are more aware of the different harms alcohol can have on you. he added that while other generations think of alcohol issues as liver disease, which you get much later in life, younger people see the fuller picture of all the associated dangers - such as taking risks and acting impulsively.jessie  social media is a great way to hold herself accountablejessie's best advice for anyone wanting to go sober would be to de-clutter your social media. fill your feed up with people who inspire you. i still to this day, nearly two years on, take one day at a time, she . that's why i still count how many days sober i am, because i don't know what's going to happen when i wake up tomorrow. but i do know i am going to wake up hangover-free.if you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the  action line.

emma and james richardson say they found themselves haemorrhaging money after buying a holiday homewhen james and emma richardson bought a £110,000 caravan at a holiday park in lincolnshire, they hoped it would benefit their whole family. the couple, from cleethorpes, used money left to s richardson by her parents – who died in 2017 and 2018 – to put down a £25,000 deposit and entered into a finance agreement to pay for the rest. they wanted to let relatives use the caravan at tattershall lakes for free holidays and also rent it out to the public to offset the cost. s richardson, 43, : i wanted to do something for the family. it was my way of being able to have them gain from me inheriting. mum and dad were very hard-working, very loving. family was everything.the richardsons  a tattershall lakes salesperson assured them they would make enough income from hiring out their caravan to cover their monthly finance repayments of £1,269. away resorts, which runs the park and manages rentals, denies any such promise was made. a spokesperson  the  the company was clear with caravan owners that there are no guarantees about subletting income. the richardsons  they found themselves haemorrhaging money after buying their caravan. we had months where we were taking £1,200 in rental costs, but we would only receive £200 of that because of linen charges, [visitor] passes, cleaning fees,   richardson, 46. we were so far short of what we were sold.emma and james richardson lost more than £50,000 over two yearsthe couple soon decided to cut their losses and offered to sell their caravan back to the park. after this offer was rejected, the richardsons paid £20,000 and handed over their caravan to get out of their third-party finance agreement. we lost, over a period of two years, in excess of £50,000, which has just crippled us,  richardson . i'm still paying credit cards off now. we've lost that inheritance that our parents worked all their lives for. s richardson  losing the money her parents had left was a bitter pill to swallow. she added: if it was just my money it would be completely different, but because it what my parents worked for… i felt like i’d let them down.skipsea in east yorkshire is home to hundreds of holiday caravanssince a boom in the 1960s, caravan holidays at britain's seaside resorts and rural beauty spots have been a popular choice among families looking for an affordable getaway. today there are more than 3,000 parks across the uk. caravan and camping holidays brought £7.2bn into the economy last year,  industry figures. the british holiday and home parks association (bhhpa), the national trade body for the sector,  these sites bring vital tourism and investment to some of the uk most economically challenged areas. the national caravans council (ncc), which also represents the industry,  there were many thousands of happy holiday caravan owners across the uk. but the richardsons are not the only family to feel they have been left out of pocket by the dream of owning a holiday home. dozens of people have  the  they lost significant sums of money – some of them their life savings, pensions or inheritance – after buying a static caravan. the founder of a group set up to support caravan owners  it was scandalous that people's lives are being ruined.andrew and sue dawson bought a static caravan at a holiday park on the east yorkshire coast in 2022, they planned to spend their retirement whiling away weekends at the seaside with their daughters and grandchildren. then they received some devastating news. in february this year,  dawson, 59, was diagnosed with incurable cancer. the doctors gave me between six months and – as they described it – a few short years, he . obviously we started talking about the future. it completely changed everything. the couple, from leeds, began getting their affairs in order and decided to sell their caravan at parkdean's skipsea sands resort. but they were in for another shock. the three-bedroom caravan with decking, for which they had paid £62,400 in 2022, was worth just £17,000 two years later. we were gobsmacked,   dawson. no one ever  us we’d face that level of depreciation. the salesman sold us the dream, but didn't sell us the reality.andrew and sue dawson enjoyed spending time with their granddaughters at skipsea sandsparkdean website states that buying a holiday home isn't considered a financial investment, as holiday homes depreciate in value with age. but  dawson  a skipsea sands salesperson  him caravans pretty much hold their value. only when the dawsons came to sell, following the cancer diagnosis, did they realise they could recoup only a fraction of their expenditure. the couple reluctantly agreed to sell their caravan back to the park for £17,000 after negotiating with the sales team. but on the day the dawsons cleared out their caravan to finalise the sale, parkdean cut the price they were willing to pay to £16,000.andrew dawson was diagnosed with stage four cancer in february dawson  his dealings with the park had been dreadful. the amount of money we've lost and the way we’ve been treated, in my opinion is very underhanded and lacking in transparency, he added. he  he felt there had been a complete lack of empathy, really, knowing my condition, knowing why were selling – that we didn't really have a lot of choice. we feel they let us down very badly.the dawsons paid £62,000 for their caravan with additional deckingafter the  contacted parkdean, a skipsea sands manager called  dawson and offered to pay him £1,000 to resolve the dispute. a parkdean spokesperson  the company was aware of and sympathetic to andrew situation and had contacted  dawson to agree a suitable offer and settle the matter. but  dawson  it was never about the money, adding: it doesn't change my view on parkdean and it doesn't change my view on the industry.sally nicholls, 70, from sheffield, used her entire pension pot and a small loan to buy a £69,000 static caravan at tattershall lakes in 2021. she  she  a salesperson she planned to live off the rental income in her retirement and was given figures indicating what she could expect to make. at the time, it looked like a good proposition, she added. ms nicholls did make a small profit from her caravan in her first year as an owner, but her takings quickly dried up after repeated increases in park charges, which she was forced to pass on to customers. she then found herself in competition with the park itself, which was able to offer more favourable rates, including free access to facilities, to prospective guests. that more or less put a complete halt to the bookings coming in, ms nicholls .sally nicholls sold her house after losing money on a caravan purchasems nicholls decided to sell her caravan but, like the dawsons, was shocked at how little it was now worth. after tattershall lakes declined to buy it back, she ended up selling to an outside trader for £17,500. it came as quite a shock to realise that i wasn’t going to get my pension back to live on in old age,  ms nicholls, who has since sold her house to free up funds for her retirement and moved to a smaller property in bolsover. i had to consider what i was going to live on, she added. the only option for me was to sell my home. away resorts  it provided all prospective buyers with comprehensive information, including detailed terms and conditions to ensure they had full awareness of the potential risks and rewards. a spokesperson added: while subletting a holiday home can be a way for some owners to generate additional income, we make it clear that there are no guarantees in relation to this, as various factors – including seasonal demand and wider economic conditions – can influence returns.ibraheem dulmeer, a barrister who specialises in holiday park law,  caravan buyers were not always fully informed about the agreements they were signing. he  it was really, really essential buyers did due diligence and got any promises from salespeople in writing. many people from the outset are not provided with any legal advice or don’t obtain any legal advice, they simply go through shaking hands, handing over large sums of money,  dulmeer added. and what seems to happen is that, as a result of that, they aren’t actually afforded the opportunity to review the terms, review the conditions, and see whether it fits for them. and that where most of the problems really stem from.the bhhpa, which represents holiday parks,  it was important consumers read the small print and fully understand the sales contract before committing to buying a caravan. a spokesperson for the ncc, the trade organisation for the industry,  holiday caravan ownership was a significant purchase decision and potential buyers should conduct their own research to fully understand what they are buying. they added: we work with our member parks to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities to help consumers understand clearly what they are buying, when and how they can use their holiday caravan or lodge, and that they treat all customers fairly and honestly using simple language and following best practice. caravan owners are protected by consumer rights laws, which are enforced by the competition and markets authority (cma) and local trading standards offices. the cma, a government regulator,  the  it could not comment on specific cases, but  businesses must not mislead their customers and any claims about products must be honest and transparent.last year, a petition signed by more than 27,000 people, which called for protections to be strengthened, was rejected by the conservative government. the petition was started by the holiday park action group, which has more than 66,000 members in a facebook group in which caravan buyers voice complaints. its founder carole keeble  consumers were consistently misled in respect of the true value of the caravans they are buying and claimed the cma was failing to act. she  the  it was a national scandal that people are losing their pensions, inheritance or having to sell their own homes to cover the losses they are incurring. meanwhile, ms nicholls  she wanted a regulator to step up and take control of the sector. she added: it's had a devastating impact on me. it's changed my life, basically. listen to highlights from hull and east yorkshire on  sounds, watch the latest episode of look north or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here,

in april, a fan approached american singer gigi perez after a show, and proudly showed off their latest tattoo. gigi i 🖤 u, read the ink. the singer was lost for words. in my head, i was like, ‘please don't regret that’,' she laughs. it's hard for me to process that somebody else has my name permanently on their skin. but, i mean, it's just the ultimate honour to know that the music impacted them so greatly that they would do that. it was the first time anyone had felt passionately enough to turn her name into a tattoo - and the timing could not have been better. six months earlier, gigi been dropped by her record label, in the middle of a promotional trip to london. and after having to move back to her parents' house, in florida, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter had to reassess her life. i was free falling, she . i had no income, i was back home, and i was starting to doubt myself. but i was like, 'let me just give myself a year to learn how to record and produce my own records. from there, if i need to get a job so i can still make music, i'll do that. and then everything happened... everything, in case you have not been following gigi's story, involved scoring a global hit single out of nowhere. sailor song, an aching love ballad about falling for a woman who looks like the actress anne hathaway, exploded online in june and quickly became a real-world success. in the uk, it went to number one, ending sabrina carpenter's nine-week run at the top. the song also reached the summit in ireland and latvia and made the top 10 everywhere from new zealand to belgium. i knew the song was special to me, gigi . i just didn't know it was going to be special to so many other people. when she found out it had reached number one, i got out of the shower and just started crying, gigi  the uk's official charts company., externalborn in new jersey and raised in florida, gigi was a drama school nerd who turned to music when she realised she was never going to be cast in the ingenue role. self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the us streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, sometimes (backwood). the song earned her a contract with interscope records and gigi supported coldplay on their music of the spheres tour before she had even played a headline show of her own. looking back, she  that initial wave of success created a pressure to expand her career too quickly. for a long time, she felt stuck and limited by her lack of progression. it was this cognitive dissonance where i’d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn’t know who’d be coming to the show, gigi . and by the time she played london last november, she knew she had reached breaking point. i asked god, or the universe, 'open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,' she . i knew it had to happen - but i was so terrified of what that meant.interscope released her two days later. but instead of the world ending, gigi's energy renewed. she wrote more songs - and taught herself how to produce them, by watching youtube tutorials. sailor song came to her in a sudden burst of inspiration this february. i was on my bed, my door was open and i was just messing around, jamming, gigi . my little sister walked by, and she was like, ‘gigi, what was that?’ and i was like, ‘i have no idea, but i think it's really cool.' there are times where i spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what i want to say. this was one of those times where it just blew out. she teased it on tiktok in april, released it in july - and, as of wednesday 20 november, it has been streamed 340 million times on spotify alone. in some ways, it is an unlikely hit. the production is low-tech and homespun and gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love. but the chorus is undeniable. kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor, she sings. and when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour? of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long. in the us, evangelical christians criticised sailor song for the line: i don't believe in god, but you're my saviour. my songwriting is not a democracy, she wrote, and that applies to every artist's work.after the success of sailor song, the singer signed a new record deal, this time with island recordsher parents became born-again christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in florida. the experience was not all positive. growing up gay in an environment where you’re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me, gigi  the bringin' it backwards podcast, in 2022. her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020. the shock and the pain are unimaginable. the foundations of gigi's world were destabilised forever. in her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable. the other day, i thought of something funny/ but no-one would've laughed but you, she sang in a song simply called celene. and mom and dad are always crying/ and i wish i knew what to do. gigi's latest release, fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at people who feebly offered thoughts and prayers after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her skin start to burn. one of the hardest parts about my grief is that i didn't have any music that touched on my life, on my situation, to get me through it, she . and so i made it for myself. i've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in fable, i  it in the way i always felt, from the very day i lost her, and i was so just relieved by the expression of it. that catharsis is a sort of self-healing. and, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it. one of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way, she . my hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. and it's amazing, because i've been seeing a lot of that. it's been very healing for me. and with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms.

massive sex tape leak could be a ploy for power in central africabaltasar ebang engonga was detained on suspicion of corruption before the videos were leakedwhat the rest of the world sees as a sex tape scandal could in fact be the latest episode in the real-life drama over who will become equatorial guinea next president. over the past fortnight, dozens of videos - estimates range from 150 to more than 400 - have been leaked of a senior civil servant having sex in his office and elsewhere with different women. they have flooded social media, shocking and titillating people in the small central african country and beyond. many of the women filmed were wives and relatives of people close to the centre of power. it appears some were aware they were being filmed having sex with baltasar ebang  engonga, who is also known as bello because of his good looks. all this is hard to verify as equatorial guinea is a highly restricted society where a free press does not exist. but one theory is that the leaks were a way to discredit the man at the centre of the storm.  engonga is a nephew of president teodoro obiang nguema and one of those thought to be hoping to replace him. obiang is the world longest-serving president having been in power since 1979. the 82-year-old has overseen an economic boom that has turned to bust as a result of the now-dwindling oil reserves. there is a small, extremely wealthy elite, but many of the 1.7 million people in the country live in poverty. obiang administration is heavily criticised for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture,  a us government report, external. it has also had its fair share of scandals - including the revelations about the lavish lifestyle of one of the president's sons, now vice-president, who once owned a $275,000 (£210,000) crystal-encrusted glove worn by michael jackson. despite regular elections, there is no real opposition in equatorial guinea as activists have been jailed and exiled and those with designs on office are closely monitored.michael jackson's bad tour glove was once owned by vice-president teodoro obiang mangue, who has ambitions to become president one daypolitics in the country is really about palace intrigue and this is where the scandal involving  engonga fits in. he was the head of the national financial investigation agency, and worked on tackling crimes such as money laundering. but it turned out he himself was under investigation. he was arrested on 25 october accused of embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the cayman islands. he has not commented on the accusation.  engonga was then taken to the infamous black beach prison in the capital, malabo, where it is alleged that opponents of the government are subjected to brutal treatment. his phones and computers were seized and a few days later the intimate videos started appearing online. the first reference the  has found to them on facebook is from 28 october on the page of diario rombe, external, a news site run by a journalist in exile in spain, which  that social networks exploded with the leaking of explicit images and videos. a post on x the following day, external referred to a monumental scandal shaking the regime as pornographic videos flood social media.teodoro obiang mangue (left) became the country's vice-president in 2016but they are believed to have originally appeared one-by-one a few days earlier on telegram, on one of the platform's channels known for publishing pornographic images. they were then downloaded on to people phones and shared among whatsapp groups in equatorial guinea, where they caused a storm.  engonga was quickly identified along with some of the women in the videos, including relatives of the president and wives to ministers and senior military officials. the government was unable to ignore what was going on and on 30 october vice-president teodoro obiang mangue (once owner of the michael jackson glove) gave telecoms companies 24 hours to come up with ways to stop the spread of the clips. we cannot continue to watch families fall apart without taking any action, he wrote on x, external. in the meantime, the origin of these publications is being investigated to find the author or authors and make them answer for their actions. as the computer equipment was in the hands of the security forces, suspicion has fallen on someone there, who, perhaps, sought to trash  engonga reputation ahead of a trial. the police have called on women to come forward to open a case against  engonga for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. one has already announced that she is suing him. what is not clear is why  engonga made the recordings. but activists have put forward what could be other motives behind the explosive leak. as well as being related to the president,  engonga is the son of baltasar engonga edjo'o, the head of the regional economic and monetary union, cemac, and very influential in the country. what we are seeing is the end of an era, the end of the current president, and there is a succession [question] and this is the internal fighting we are seeing,  equatoguinean activist nsang christia esimi cruz, now living in london. speaking to the  focus on africa podcast, he alleged that vice-president obiang was trying to politically eliminate anyone who could challenge his succession.president teodoro obiang nguema secured almost 95% of the vote in elections held two years agothe vice-president, along with his mother, are suspected to be pushing aside anyone who threatens his path to the presidency, including gabriel obiang lima (another son of president obiang from a different wife), who was oil minister for 10 years and then moved to a secondary government role. those in the elite are thought to know things about each other that they would rather was not made public, and videos have been used in the past to humiliate and discredit a political opponent. there are also frequent accusations of coup plotting, which further fuels paranoia. but  cruz also alleges that the authorities want to use the scandal as an excuse to crack down on social media, which is how a lot of information about what is really going on in the country gets out. in july, the authorities temporarily suspended the internet after protests broke out on the island of annobón. for him, the fact that a high-ranking official was having sex outside of marriage was not surprising as it was part of the decadent lifestyle of the country elite. the vice-president, who himself has been convicted of corruption in france and has had lavish assets seized in various countries, wants to be seen as the man cracking down on graft and wrong-doing at home. last year, for example, he ordered the arrest of his half-brother over allegations he sold a plane owned by the state airline. but in this case, despite the vice-president efforts to stop the spread of the clips, they continue to be viewed. this week, he tried to appear more resolute calling for the installation of cctv cameras in government offices to combat indecent and illicit acts, the official news agency , external. saying that the scandal had denigrated the image of the country he ordered that any officials found engaging in sex acts at work would be suspended as this was a flagrant violation of the code of conduct. he was not wrong that the story has attracted a lot of outside interest. judging by google's data, search enquiries that include the country name have shot up since the beginning of this week. on monday, on x, equatorial guinea was one of the top trending terms in kenya, nigeria and south africa - surpassing at times interest in the us election. this has left some activists who have been trying to tell the world about what is really going on in the country frustrated. equatorial guinea has much bigger problems than this sex scandal,   cruz, who works for a rights organisation called ge nuestra. this sex scandal for us is just a symptom of the illness, it not the illness itself. it just shows how corrupt the system is.

a party in power for 58 years pledges change for botswanabotswana governing party - in power for almost six decades - is trying to pull off a trick in wednesday general election by using a phrase normally associated with long-suffering opposition groups. in its manifesto, the botswana democratic party (bdp) is calling for change. let change together and build prosperity for all, president mokgweetsi masisi - in charge of the country since 2018 – writes in the introduction. it is an acknowledgement that things need to be done differently - the opposition argues that the president party is not in a position to do that. though analysts say the outcome of the election is hard to predict this time, the bdp has won handsome parliamentary majorities at the 11 elections since independence in 1966. it subsequently secured the presidency every time as mps elect the head of state. the bdp has been credited with overseeing a peaceful and dramatic transformation of a poor country, with only a few kilometres of tarred roads at independence, into a place where average living standards are among the highest on the continent. underpinning this transformation has been botswana huge diamond reserves - measured by their value, the country is the world largest producer of the gemstone. botswana is facing big economic challenges - hence masisi's talk of change. more than one in four of the working population is unemployed, with an even higher proportion among younger people,  the world bank. politics professor at the university of botswana zibani maundeni described it as a jobless economy. we are producing graduates every year and the economy is not producing enough jobs for them, he  the  africa daily podcast.the botswana congress party is using the slogan save botswana to rally supportin addition, botswana wealth is not evenly spread around among its 2.3 million people. by a measure known as the gini index, researchers say it is one of the most unequal countries in the world, external. and the diamond industry appears to be under pressure globally as demand has been falling. but masisi and his party continue to project confidence. at a campaign rally in an opposition stronghold in central botswana, the president arrived in style in an electric vehicle assembled in the country. getting out, the 63-year-old former teacher danced towards the stage greeting supporters in red-and-white party colours. laughter rang through the crowd as masisi humour and charisma electrified the audience. the area - home to the previous president, ian khama - elected three opposition mps in 2019. this was after khama defected from the bdp to help form the botswana patriotic front (bpf), saying he regretted picking masisi as his successor. the dramatic fall-out between the two men led to khama leaving the country, accusing the government of trying to poison him. khama was then charged with money laundering, among other crimes, all of which he denies.ex-president ian khama (r) has fallen out with his successorit also ended the political dominance of his family - his father, sir seretse khama, was the country's first president and served for 14 years from 1966. i am sorry, please come back home and also call others over, masisi  the rally pleading to voters to return to the bdp. masisi truly understands our challenges and brought better programmes to fund our businesses, she  the , her eyes shining with conviction. his policies have helped us grow as you can see we no longer import vegetables. i believe in his vision for our future,  the small-business owner.• none how friends became foes in africa's diamond statebut  an opinion poll, many others may not be so easy to convince. it  that despite the country ranking highly in good governance on the continent, people in botswana had a negative view of the government believing there were high levels of corruption. strong majorities express little or no trust in the incumbent and disapprove of the way he has performed his job, it . bdp spokesperson kagelelo banks kentse questioned the credibility of the poll. he argued that afrobarometer had in previous elections underestimated support for the bdp and thought it would be no different this time. though the party is not taking anything for granted. i would be very wrong to say that we are over-confident, kentse  the . i always hear people saying: ‘this is the toughest election we’ve come across’, but we say that in every election year. you never win before the actual vote. he admitted that the unemployment rate did not paint a good picture, but argued that every nation on the continent was experiencing similar problems, adding that his party was pledging to create 300,000 more jobs. kentse also touted the toughly negotiated deal that masisi struck with diamond firm de beers last year for botswana to benefit more from its natural resources. initially the state will get a 30% share of the rough diamonds mined in the country, an increase on the 25% it got previously, rising to 50% within 10 years. but dumelang saleshando, leader of one of the largest opposition parties, argued that the government has just copied others’ ideas. he  his botswana congress party (bcp) had first set a jobs target, which the bdp had previously rejected saying it was better to leave things to the free market. one of the slogans saleshando is deploying is: save botswana. i think people have seen the bdp for what it is, he  the . it certainly cannot argue that it is an agent of change. in the past it has always tried to say it about keeping stability - more of the same - and out of panic they are trying to preach what they don’t believe in.udc leader duma boko (r in blue tie) has alleged that there have been attempts to rig the electionsupporters of another opposition party - the umbrella for democratic change (udc), which got the second largest share of the vote in 2019, came out in their numbers in the north of the capital, gaborone. dressed in blue-and-white t-shirts and sun hats, they cheered leader duma boko. unlike masisi, boko generally remained serious, in order to emphasise how much the people were suffering under the bdp. he alleged that there were attempts to rig the poll. i urge you all to be vigilant and after voting out the bdp you remain at the polling station to guard your vote, he . thapelo dimpe, a 45-year-old former teacher, has no doubts about why he wants to see the president's party defeated. masisi has let us down on education reform. the udc plans to invest in our schools and empower our youth with the education they deserve, he . although the government has a host of problems that could dent its support, opposition divisions could enable the bdp to stay in power. every mp is elected on a first-past-the-post basis, meaning that to win a seat, the bdp only needs the largest number of votes in a constituency rather than more than 50%. in a seat where the udc, bcp or bpf – or a number of other parties – are running, it could mean that the opposition vote is split, allowing the bdp to get in. these parties seem to have factionalism within themselves, they keep taking internal issues to the media – they are not really united, political analyst lesole machacha  the . but he also pointed out that the bdp had its own problems. the ruling party is not 100% intact – it is also having issues. in some constituencies bdp politicians who were not happy with the primary process are running as independent candidates, which could divide that vote,  machacha . all this makes for a closely fought and unpredictable election, he added. for one of africa most successful political parties, the question now is whether enough people are convinced that it can oversee the change that the country needs.

to a west yorkshire railway station. but thanks to the kindness of the train driver who found her in crisis, she did not go through with it. three years later they married each other and went on to have children.i'd struggled with my mental health since my teens and i'd been in and out of the system since, charlotte, now 33, . her memories of that day five years ago are quite blurry but she  she

charlotte and introducing himself. he  her they would talk things through until you feel comfortable enough to get onto the train, where she could be taken to safety. the pair talked for half an hour, by which time charlotte, though still distressed, agreed to get into the cab. she was taken to skipton station and left in the care of the police. the following day, charlotte was desperate to find the man who had been so kind to her and issued an appeal on a local facebook group for anyone who worked for northern who might be able to put her in touch. i’d have understood if he didn’t want to

as people get richer in south east asia, parents are increasingly turning to commercial food products to feed their babiesjennylyn m barrios’ job as a make-up artist takes her all over manila – precious time away from uno, her 10-month-old son. there simply isn’t enough time in the day to make the homemade meals her growing baby needs. but in rapidly developing philippines, there are increasingly options for busy, working mums like her. if i need to make something from scratch, i need to work double time before i finish the product, she explains. but for cerelac, i just need to add hot water and prepare the mix. i feed it three times a day – for breakfast, lunch, and then for dinner. it easy to feed, available, affordable – all great for working mums. jennylyn is one of many mums increasingly turning to commercially available baby food products in recent years: sales of instant cereals, porridges, pureed foods, pouches and snacks across south east asia have doubled in five years. cerelac - an instant porridge mix - is nestle biggest seller here, offering not only convenience but aspiration as well, all for an affordable price, a key consideration with a rise in cost of living. a quick search on social media shows a slew of aspirational mums with their smiling infants extolling its virtues - including offering some of the crucial nutrients growing children need. but while the product will be instantly recognisable to parents across the world, the ingredients here may not be. because, along with the benefits of added micronutrients cerelac offers parents in the philippines and the uk, some flavours in the south east asian nation offer something else: added sugar. and that, in a country where parents are increasingly turning from traditional diets to convenience foods, has health professionals worried.nestle dominates 98% of the baby food market in the philippinesin the philippines, nestle  it follows a set of standards and guidelines from the codex commission – a collective established by the food and agriculture organization (fao) and world health organization (who) consisting of food manufacturers, governments and un agencies. the added sugar we have in our products are all well below the threshold prescribed by international and local guidelines who always follow the fda, who follows codex, and these are the experts in this field,  arlene tan-bantoto, nestlé nutrition business executive officer. but who has called the current standards inadequate and recommends they be updated with a particular focus on avoiding sugar and salt in any food for children under three. yet a unicef study of 1,600 baby foods across south east asia found nearly half included added sugars and sweeteners. there is,  ms tan-bantoto, a simple explanation for why it is needed in cerelac in particular: to disguise the taste of crucial nutrients like iron, which has a metallic taste, and the brain nutrient, dha, which smells like fish. micronutrient deficiency is widespread in the country and we are serious in our efforts in alleviating it,  ms tan-bantoto. ninety-seven percent of babies do not meet their daily nutrient requirement, 40% of babies, zero to five, suffer from iron deficiency anaemia. and we know that to be anaemic has lifelong consequences. for instance, brain development and next poor immunity and 20% of kids zero to five are stunted. that means we fortify our products.• none sugar in first 1,000 days linked to poor health laterat a clinic in manila, they see first-hand the impacts of malnutrition on babies and toddlers on a regular basis - although as diets change, so too is how the cases are presenting. sometimes they are underweight, some are overweight, and some are severely malnourished, one doctor  the . it is impossible to say exactly why there has been a rise in overweight children. there are multiple factors in the rise of obesity – including a change in lifestyles and urbanisation. but nutritionists say taste preferences are developed at a young age and in some countries like in the philippines, many foods catering to a sweet palate are started early. it is why the added sugar in a product like cerelac is such a concern,  public health experts like dr mianne silvestre. the most popular flavour of cerelac in the philippines has about 17.5g of total sugars per serving – more than four teaspoons of sugar - but that can include both naturally occurring and added sugars. nestle  in the philippines, it has several variants or flavours without added sugar, and also flavours with added sugar. we always mention that malnutrition isn't just being undernourished, it's also overnourished also overweight and obese children, and very difficult to diet, explains dr silvestre. starting these babies so young on this level of sugar. it mind-boggling. unicef nutrition officer for the philippines, alice nkoroi,  a lack of local, government regulation also puts parents at a distinct disadvantage. if you go to other countries in europe... they will have regulations that control what is sold out there and also make sure that companies put out what is they're clear on what is in the content and at the front of the pack, it's easy for the families and consumers to understand what is good for them and what is unhealthy, she points out. and it is not just what is in the product - or on the packaging - which needs regulating, she adds. we conducted a digital scan... and what we saw is that families are bombarded 99% on what is on social media, ms nkoroi . there's a need for us to regulate what is coming out or being pushed out there in social media, especially targeted to children.many influencers in the philippines promote baby food productschiara maganalles - or mommy diaries ph as she known on social media - has 1.6 million facebook followers. in a lively youtube video for nestle parenteam educational platform, she tells tens of thousands of subscribers about the benefits of cerelac. she been promoting the product for years, and for her, it is a win-win. i mean with my first kid... i did feed her cerelac first because it's convenient... it suits our budget... because of the nutritional content as well, it  that it's fortified with iron, she . influencing has also transformed chiara life – she now able to support her family from the money she makes from brand deals. but critics say paid partnerships can look like trustworthy expert advice compared to conventional advertising methods. and what chaira recommended - feeding cerelac several times a day - goes even against what nestle  the . ms tan-bantoto described it as a complementary food to a baby diet, which should not be taken the whole day. at least give one bowl, she , for the nutritional value. nestle  it recommends one serving of infant cereal each day along with a diverse diet of foods, like fruits, vegetables, and meat daily. the company  the information is shared on its product labels, but promotional material on e-commerce sites and its educational platform suggest meal plans with cerelac products up to three times a day.imee marcos, sister of the current president, is sponsoring a bill that would criminalise added sugar in baby foodthe demand for regulation in the philippines does have some star power. the sister of the current president and daughter of former president ferdinand marcos snr - imee marcos - is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit manufacturers of baby food from adding sugar in their products. a failure to comply could lead to a hefty fine, and imprisonment of producers and manufacturers for one to five years. i'm very hopeful that it will see the light of day. there's so many bills and the food lobbies, the huge multinationals that purvey all these foods are immensely powerful and until today i haven't even had a hearing, senator imee marcos  the . for its part nestle  it is listening to concerns, and is phasing out added sugar in baby food - but that balancing the nutritional profile and composition of the product with taste takes time. the company's bestseller is due to get a sugar-free variety, with plans to completely eliminate all added sugar in the next two to three years, ms tan-bantoto . research published this week indicates that cutting sugar in the first 1,000 days of a baby's life - from conception to the age of two - appears to reduce the risk of developing significant health issues in adult life. a team of researchers at the university of southern california found that limiting the intake of sugar in early life cut the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 35%, and high blood pressure by 20%. experts believe the first 1,000 days of life are a crucial period which can shape a person's future health.

or as he puts it america first. his victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in washington approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. we can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.during the campaign, trump repeatedly  he could end the war between russia and ukraine in a day. when asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. a research paper written by two of trump former national security chiefs in may  the us should continue its weapons supply to ukraine, but make the support conditional on kyiv entering peace talks with russia. to entice russia, the west would promise to delay ukraine much-wanted entry into nato. the former advisers  ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. trump democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to russian president vladimir putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for ukraine and will endanger all of europe. he has consistently  his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on us resources.it not clear how far the former advisers’ paper represents trump own thinking, but it likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he’ll get. his america first approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the world war two, originally as a bulwark against the soviet union.nato now counts 32 countries and trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing europe of free-riding on america promise of protection. whether he would actually withdraw the us from nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance defence spending guidelines. but the reality is nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.as with ukraine, trump has promised to bring peace to the middle east - implying he would end the israel-hamas war in gaza and the israel-hezbollah war in lebanon - but has not  how. he has repeatedly  that, if he had been in power rather than joe biden, hamas would not have attacked israel because of his maximum pressure policy on iran, which funds the group. broadly, it likely trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the us out of the iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against iran and kill gen qasem soleimani - iran most powerful military commander. in the white house, trump enacted strongly pro-israel policies, naming jerusalem as israel capital and moving the us embassy there from tel aviv - a move which energised trump christian evangelical base, a core republican voter group. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called trump the best friend that israel has ever had in the white house. but critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. the palestinians boycotted the trump administration, because of washington abandonment of their claim to jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for palestinians. they were further isolated when trump brokered the so-called abraham accords, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between israel and several arab and muslim countries. they did so without israel having to accept a future independent palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.
