met faces service cuts without more cash,  chiefthe boss of the uk's largest police force has warned it faces eye-watering cuts to services unless ministers increase its funding. met commissioner sir mark rowley  the  he was deeply troubled by talks so far on its annual settlement for next year. he added that the force was in a precarious position because previously used options to prop up its budget were no longer available. the government has  it plans to increase the overall policing budget next year - although allocations by force are still to be negotiated.the met's budget for this year is just over £3.5bn, a 3.5% increase from 2023/24, comprising £2.6bn from central government and £956m from local taxes. sir mark  conversations over its funding allocation from next april - which would normally be expected to be announced in december or january - were still ongoing with the government and city hall. but, speaking to  radio 4's political thinking with nick robinson, he  he was deeply troubled by the situation we appear to be heading towards. policing a global capital such as london came with an extra set of challenges, he , adding that spending per person was lower than in other cities such as new york and sydney. he  that the cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so had put the force in a more and more precarious position, and some of its buildings would be unusable in a few years without further investment. some of the things that successive [police] commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out, he added. the chancellor has been very clear - it's a difficult public sector context.you add all those things together, and you get a dramatic change in budgets of a scale that's never going to be absorbed by efficiencies, and is going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to london. he added that he was not going to get into detail at this stage on the tough choices the force would face without an increase in resources. but he  he planned to specify 10 or 20 things we're going to do differently before christmas. he added that the implications for policing in the capital would become more public in the coming weeks. the budget for the home office is set to shrink by 3.3% next year in real terms, with the bulk of this coming from assumed savings on asylum support. at last month's budget, the government  it planned to increase the core government grant for police forces, although it did not specify whether this would be in cash terms or taking account of inflation. before the election, labour also  it also planned to save £360m through more efficient purchasing of police equipment, which it promised to spend on extra community support officers.sign up for our politics essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the uk and stay up to speed with the big moments. it’ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

new deals with balkan states to target people smugglersthe uk has signed new agreements with western balkan countries to tackle people-smuggling gangs, as part of efforts to bring down small boat crossings. the deals will increase intelligence sharing and cooperation with serbia, north macedonia and kosovo to intercept and arrest the gangs, with the aim of breaking their business models at source. the government  the region was a key route used by those who end up in the european union or uk illegally, with almost 100,000 migrants transiting through the western balkans last year. prime minister sir keir starmer announced the plans at a meeting of the european political community (epc) in hungarian capital budapest on thursday.more than 31,000 people have crossed the channel in small boats so far this year - more than the same period last year. the uk already has agreements with countries including albania and turkey to share intelligence to disrupt people-smuggling gangs. sir keir : there is a criminal empire operating on our continent, exacting a horrendous human toll and undermining our national security. he  the uk would be at the heart of the efforts to end the scourge of organised immigration crime but we cannot do it in isolation. he added: we need to go further and faster, alongside our international partners, and take the fight directly to the heart of these vile people smuggling networks. home secretary yvette cooper : working more closely with serbia, north macedonia and kosovo, we will share information and intelligence, and work across borders to map out what is happening and where, to break the business models of these unscrupulous gangs at source.it comes after the government announced an extra £75m funding for the uk's new border security command, which brings together police, intelligence and immigration enforcement agencies to tackle small boat crossings. graeme biggar, the national crime agency's (nca) director general,   radio 4's today programme that continuing to work with international partners was crucial. he added that it is very difficult to have exact confidence on how much measures would reduce the number of uk small boat crossings as so much depends on what's happening with the rest of the world. on tackling people-smuggling gangs,  biggar  that what is particularly hard for the nca is that the people themselves are not illegal, their presence in the uk or in some countries on the way here may be illegal, and often the tools that they are using to get here are not themselves illegal - boats and engines. so being able to prove a criminal conspiracy is quite hard, he added. the epc was set up in 2022 in response to russia's invasion of ukraine as a way of bringing together european heads of government for informal talks and improving cooperation. the group includes the 27 members of the eu as well as 20 other european countries.

alex salmond loved creating headlines. he would be disappointed if he gave an interview that was not sufficiently interesting to make the news. as a young radio journalist, i was sent to see him at a business breakfast event where at that time he was demanding the uk join the single european currency. when i suggested this was not new, that he’d  it many times before, he : yes but i’m saying it more forcefully now because the case is more urgent. anything to make his contribution count. spending time in his company could easily make you late. he tended not to limit interview duration and enjoyed further conversation, debate and showing off a bit after the microphones were off.i can remember interviewing him in his early days as first minister at his official residence, bute house in edinburgh. the interview was over and i needed to go - but he wanted to show me a collection of silverware that had been found in a cupboard, and share something of its history. while he could be charming and entertaining and always offered a sharp analysis of the politics of the day, there was also a less pleasant side to his character. i would wince when sometimes he would show impatience and irritation towards his staff. he could be very demanding of them. i can also remember bringing a senior  editor from the newsroom in london to see him, and was astonished when he asked my colleague if he was on a colonial visit.alex salmond and alistair darling took part in a debate chaired by glenn campbell ahead of the scottish independence referendum in 2014he had a love/hate relationship with the . he loved when he was offered a prestigious spot on a network show like question time, especially when his political career was in decline. at other times, he would rage against output he did not like. he was not happy that i interviewed, anonymously, one of the women who had accused him of sexual offences in court, after he had been acquitted of all charges. it was not an attempt to re-try the case but a response to his claims of a political conspiracy. i am not sure he forgave me for that. i travelled with him to europe, the united states and china. i remember him turning up uncharacteristically early at the forbidden city in beijing to meet china vice-premier and finding himself locked out. it would have made powerful tv footage but i don’t think we got it on camera. he thought we had captured this embarrassing moment and gave me a private briefing and a couple of scoops in the hope i wouldn’t use it.alex salmond lived and breathed politics and he seemed completely lost when he was ejected from parliament in 2017. i bumped into him in edinburgh soon after and we shared a taxi to waverley station. naturally we talked politics and when it came time to part he just kept the conversation going. in recent years, we talked far less. he refused to take part in a podcast series i made about nicola sturgeon time in office - which would obviously have included the spectacular rift between them. that was not like him. in all my previous experience, he rarely missed a media opportunity. better in his view to get out there and make his case rather than shy away and let others set the narrative.

Cluster 3:
Topic:  Northern Territory has the highest rate of incarceration in Australia, with more than 1,100 per 100,000 people behind bars . The issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight after the territory's new government lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10 . Aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws . Critics say the move, which defies a un recommendation, means locking up even more young people .
Example texts: 'adult crime, adult time': row as australian territory locks up 10-year-olds againa protest was held outside the northern territory's parliament in darwin as mps debated lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10'thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison. following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in australia northern territory (nt). he was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary. five years on, the aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out. it hard changing, thomas tells me. [breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it hard to [stop] the habit. his story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the northern territory. for many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. the northern territory is the part of australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average, external. it also more than twice the rate of the us, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. but the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. the move, which defies a un recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.business owner sunil kumar  his restaurant had five or six break-ins in the last year and is in favour of tougher lawsit's not just an issue of incarceration. it's one of inequalities too. while around 30% of the northern territory's population is aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are indigenous. so, aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. the country liberal party (clp) government  it has a mandate after campaigning to keep territorians safe. it helped the party claim a landslide victory in august's elections. among those voting for the clp was sunil kumar. the owner of two indian restaurants in darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. it's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun, explains  kumar. he  he improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. how come they are out and parents don't know? he . there should be a punishment for the parents. but while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. youth offender rates have risen since covid. last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. but the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the northern territory, australian bureau of statistics figures show. politicians, though, are playing to residents’ fears. as well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as declan's law, after declan laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. i never want another family to experience what we have,  his mother samara laverty. the passing of this legislation is a turning point for the territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place.on the day the laws started to be debated in darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. one woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. another asked: 'what if it was your child?' our young people in don dale need to have opportunity for hope,  aboriginal elder, aunty barb nasir, addressing the demonstrators. she was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. we need to always stand for them because they are lost in there, aunty barb . kat mcnamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill,  the crowd: the idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt. after a ripple of applause, she added: we are not going to stand for it. but with a large majority in parliament, the clp easily managed to pass the laws.protesters opposing the new law argue that jailing 10-year-olds is not a sustainable long-term solutionlowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. and while other australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the australian capital territory. australia is not alone – in england and wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. but in comparison, the majority of european union members make it 14, in line with un recommendations. the northern territory's chief minister, lia finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can intervene early and address the root causes of crime. we have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time, she  last month. and we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more. but for people like thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. his crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. he  he finds prison oddly comforting. it's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. most of my family has been in and out of jail. i felt like i was at home because all the boys took care of me. his two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. at one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now – his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. he's been helped by brother 2 another - an aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports first nations children caught up in the justice system.darren damaso, from the program brother 2 another,  there should be more investment in services to support young aboriginal peoplelocking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,  darren damaso, a youth leader for brother 2 another. there needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. and then we're going to slowly start to see change. but if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work.  damaso is from the larrakia aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of darwin, and he also has connections to the yanuwa and malak malak people. his organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. brother 2 another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. it's a self-perpetuating cycle,  john lawrence, a scottish criminal barrister who's been based in darwin for more than three decades. he's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. aboriginal people have no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm,   lawrence. the fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.the tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the northern territory. in queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the liberal national party played heavily on its slogan: adult crime, adult time. in a recent report by the australian human rights commission, anne hollonds, the national children commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them first nations children - the country is creating one of australia's most urgent human rights challenges. the systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps, she . we cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer. which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. what are the cultural strengths of people? what are the community strengths of people? we are building on that,  erin reilly, a regional director for children's ground. her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the aboriginal 'kinship’ system - how people fit in with their community and family. we centre indigenous world views and indigenous values and we work in a way that works for aboriginal people, explains ms reilly. we know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people. for thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. but on the outside, he , there little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. i felt like no one cared. nobody wanted to listen, he . he points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: so, i hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?

what trump's win means for ukraine, middle east and chinadonald trump return to the white house is set to reshape us foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. during his campaign, trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it america first. his victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in washington approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. we can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.during the campaign, trump repeatedly  he could end the war between russia and ukraine in a day. when asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. a research paper written by two of trump former national security chiefs in may  the us should continue its weapons supply to ukraine, but make the support conditional on kyiv entering peace talks with russia. to entice russia, the west would promise to delay ukraine much-wanted entry into nato. the former advisers  ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. trump democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to russian president vladimir putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for ukraine and will endanger all of europe. he has consistently  his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on us resources.it not clear how far the former advisers’ paper represents trump own thinking, but it likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he’ll get. his america first approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the world war two, originally as a bulwark against the soviet union.nato now counts 32 countries and trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing europe of free-riding on america promise of protection. whether he would actually withdraw the us from nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance defence spending guidelines. but the reality is nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.as with ukraine, trump has promised to bring peace to the middle east - implying he would end the israel-hamas war in gaza and the israel-hezbollah war in lebanon - but has not  how. he has repeatedly  that, if he had been in power rather than joe biden, hamas would not have attacked israel because of his maximum pressure policy on iran, which funds the group. broadly, it likely trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the us out of the iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against iran and kill gen qasem soleimani - iran most powerful military commander. in the white house, trump enacted strongly pro-israel policies, naming jerusalem as israel capital and moving the us embassy there from tel aviv - a move which energised trump christian evangelical base, a core republican voter group. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called trump the best friend that israel has ever had in the white house. but critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. the palestinians boycotted the trump administration, because of washington abandonment of their claim to jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for palestinians. they were further isolated when trump brokered the so-called abraham accords, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between israel and several arab and muslim countries. they did so without israel having to accept a future independent palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.

the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of arab countries for such a regional deal. the countries involved were instead given access to advanced us weapons in return for recognising israel. the palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the gaza war to end. he has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. he also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key arab countries that have contacts with hamas. it unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. trump allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile middle east in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it far from clear how this would play out. trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the biden administration to get a gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by hamas.america approach to china is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. when he was in office, trump labelled china a strategic competitor and imposed tariffs on some chinese imports to the us. this sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by beijing on american imports. there were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled covid a chinese virus. while the biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to china policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the trump-era tariffs on imports.• none what chinese people want from the us the trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the us about protecting american manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional us industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. trump has praised chinese president xi jinping as both brilliant and dangerous and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist- part of what opponents characterised as trump admiration for dictators. the former president seems likely to shift away from the biden administration approach of building stronger us security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain china. the us has maintained military assistance for self-ruled taiwan, which china sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under beijing control. trump  in october that if he returned to the white house, he would not have to use military force to prevent a chinese blockade of taiwan because president xi knew he was [expletive] crazy, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on chinese imports if that happened.

migrant took own life after 'multiple failings' at uk detention centrefrank ospina took his own life in immigration detentionan inquest jury has found multiple failings and missed opportunities at an immigration detention centre contributed to a colombian man taking his own life in 2023. the coroner examining the death of frank ospina  he had been let down by the state in numerous ways which were utterly regretful. last year the  revealed frank ospina had died in the detention removal facility despite being willing to return home to colombia. the jury found his case should have been reviewed because of his worsening mental health, which could have led to him being released. offering its condolences, the home office  steps had been taken since  ospina's death to improve safeguards for individuals in detention.frank ospina, 39, an engineering graduate, came to the uk in late 2022 to visit his mother, who had settled here, and to visit prospective universities. having decided to instead enrol on a master's course in spain, which was due to begin in may 2023, he took a short-term job washing dishes, his family say. but as a foreign national  ospina did not have the right to work in the uk. he was arrested in an immigration raid and taken to the heathrow detention centres. behind bars he suffered a mental health crisis and on 26 march 2023 was found dead at the harmondsworth facility, having strangled himself. the inquest jury concluded that he had killed himself.frank ospina suffered a mental health crisis while detained and awaiting removal from the ukthe jury's key finding centred on a detention centre rule that medical staff should report any detainee suspected of having suicidal intentions. the failure to submit a rule 35.2 report meant frank ospina's release from detention was never considered by the home office, the jury concluded. his mother visited him but was separated from him by a glass wall which the jury described as inappropriate and unnecessary. it contributed to the deterioration of his mental health and incurred further stress, the jury decided. staff on duty that night made unacceptably inadequate observations of frank ospina, failing to spot he was not in his bed. he was found out of sight, having strangled himself.the coroner, lydia brown, offered her condolences to his family telling the court the state took frank ospina into detention and this jury found they let him down in numerous ways and of course his family down that is utterly regretful and now irretrievable.frank ospina was detained at harmondsworth alongside failed asylum seekers and former foreign criminals. he  a charity he was prepared to be removed from the uk under a voluntary return scheme and was not trying to avoid deportation. his brother-in-law, julian llano,  the : he kept insisting that he felt very bad, mentally, that he needed to get out of there. he didn't ask for help - he begged for help, not only to us, but also to the people there.harmondsworth immigration removal centre is europe's largest detention facility and can hold up to 676 men.immigration detention centres are run like prisons, but many of those detained have committed no crime. they are held while the authorities prepare for them to be removed from the uk. the ospina case highlighted ongoing concerns about the management of immigration centres, six years after a  investigation revealed the abuse of detainees at brook house near gatwick. the chair of a public inquiry into that scandal  in september only one of her 33 recommended changes had been carried out by the government. yet the centres are under growing pressure because the government is planning to remove more failed asylum seekers as part of a plan to reduce small boat crossings.a spokesperson for mitie, which runs the harmondsworth facility,  the physical and mental wellbeing of those in our care is of the utmost importance to us. we accept that the decision to place  ospina family in a closed room for their visit was wrong and not in accordance with our policies and procedures, and we have apologised for this. a number of measures have already been implemented and we will continue working with the home office and practice plus group to address the matters raised by the coroner. a home office spokesperson : we offer our sincere condolences to  ospina loved ones, and since his death in 2023 a number of actions have been taken to improve the safeguards for individuals in detention, including an increase in staffing numbers, training and guidance for staff. the new government is focused on ensuring actions are taken to improve conditions in detention facilities, including reviewing the current process for communicating risk and vulnerability of detained individuals. we will carefully consider the coroner recommendations. if you or someone you know are feeling emotionally distressed, details of organisations offering advice and support can be found on the  action line website.
