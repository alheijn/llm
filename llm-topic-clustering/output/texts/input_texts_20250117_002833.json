    "Trump revellers gather in Florida to await his arrival\n\nMusk has been campaigning hard for Trump in Pennsylvania, where polls suggest Trump is in a tie with his Democratic rival\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man, planned to spend election night with Donald Trump in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago resort, he said on X/Twitter. Mr Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, has aggressively campaigned for the Republican candidate in swing states across the country. Trump's campaign is also hosting a watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center for thousands of supporters. The tech billionaire has emerged as one of the most important backers of Trump and donated more than $119m (\u00a391.6m) this election cycle to America PAC - a political action committee he created to support the former president.\n\nMr Musk announced his support for the former president earlier this year, despite saying in 2022 that \"it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset\". He posted a photo of himself on Tuesday saying he voted in Cameron County, Texas - where some of his companies are headquartered - before heading to Florida. Later in the evening, he wrote on X, \"Game, set and match\". The campaign was feeling confident late on Tuesday as supporters gathered at Trump's headquarters in the Palm Beach convention centre to wait for results. At one point, the crowd broke into a dance celebration to YMCA. Huge cheers erupted in the crowd as the state of Florida was projected as a win for Trump, albeit a win that was never in doubt. Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard arrived at the party, after previously attending Trump's more exclusive watch party at Mar-a-Lago. \"There's a lot of really excited people there\" who were \"cautiously optimistic\", she told the BBC. Steve Witkoff, a close friend of Trump, was also with him at Mar-a-Lago. There was \"a strong feeling of excitement and purpose\", he said.\n\nThe crowd included Blake Marnell, who often wore a brick-patterned suit to Trump events in support of Trump's as-yet unfounded promise to build a wall along the southern border. He said he was feeling very optimistic about his candidate's chances. Sergio Ramirez, a businessman originally from El Salvador, claimed Trump could only lose if the Democrats \"cheated... I don\u2019t see how she can win \u2014 Kamala wasn\u2019t a popular candidate.\" Michael, dressed in a \u201cBlacks for Trump 2024\u201d T-shirt. \u201cWe outnumbered them in early voting and we outnumber them now\u201d, he claims. At a formalwear event next door in the Hilton hotel, Iowa Republican delegate Deborah Yanna said it felt like \"Christmas morning\". \"When President Trump takes the White House back, he\u2019s going to make America sparkle again,\" she said. Elsewhere, Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of the Trump White House, plans to hold an election watch party tonight at the Willard Hotel - the five-star Washington DC hotel that served as the \"command centre\" for Trump loyalists seeking to overturn the 2020 election results. Bannon was released from federal prison one week ago, after serving four months behind bars for contempt of the US Congress. Kamala Harris will spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater and a historically black university in Washington DC.",
    "Lando Norris has won in Miami, the Netherlands and Singapore so far this season\n\nLando Norris says he and McLaren will be able to call 2024 a success even if they do not succeed in beating Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen to the title. Norris heads into this weekend's United States Grand Prix, the first of the final six races of the season, 52 points adrift of Verstappen. Briton Norris won the previous race in Singapore four weeks ago with Verstappen second. Norris said: \"We\u2019re fighting against the best of the best but no matter what it has still been a successful season.\" The gap between Verstappen and Norris equates to an average of nearly nine points a race - more than the gap between first and second places. It has narrowed from 78 points following the Belgian Grand Prix, four races ago.\n\nNorris said: \"If I finish second it\u2019s because Red Bull and Max have done a better job. \"We started (the season) a long way behind. Everyone thought Max was going to have an easy win. \"For that not to be the case after the gap they had after race one, it\u2019s still a year to be proud of. \"But as the season goes on, you always reevaluate what are our expectations and now we are a top team and fighting for drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championships. \"I\u2019ve been doing a good job. I have been happy with the job I have been doing and what we are doing as a team and confident if we keep our heads down and keep pushing, we can close the gap. \"It\u2019s not easy, we need more than me first and Max second but I can\u2019t change that, just keep my head down and focus on myself.\" Verstappen has won seven races this season to Norris' three but has not taken the chequered flag first since the Spanish Grand Prix in June. Speaking in Austin on Thursday, the Dutchman said: \"It\u2019s 50-50 - yes or no. There is a lot that can go well or go wrong in these six races, plus sprint races as well. Nothing is guaranteed from both sides. I prefer not to think too much and live weekend to weekend. From now on, every weekend is crucial.\" Norris said McLaren\u2019s belief changed after he took his maiden F1 victory in Miami in early May, but he acknowledged that he and the team had made some mistakes that had stopped them narrowing the gap quicker. \"(There are) races we kind of regret not winning, probably Silverstone being the main one that didn\u2019t go our way when it should have done,\" he said. \"And we look back on that with a bit of regret that we didn\u2019t end up in better positions than we did. \"From Silverstone there was more focus from everyone, including the mechanics and engineers, because it became more and more real that we were in a position we had worked very hard to be in. \"I\u2019m loving it... there is more pressure and a few more nerves but I am still very relaxed and chilled about it.\"",
    "Why there is silence on Ten Hag's Man Utd future\n\nErik ten Hag has been Manchester United manager since 2022\n\nManchester United held a monthly board meeting in central London on Tuesday which the BBC reported as being significant in determining the immediate future of United manager Erik ten Hag. The meeting lasted around six hours, with footage of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe arriving and leaving published by some media. After the big build-up, silence. We don't know the outcome because no-one is saying. Last summer, United took just over two weeks from their FA Cup final win over Manchester City to confirm Ten Hag would continue in his job, after days of speculation before and after the game that the Dutchman would be sacked. The BBC reported that United were considering other managers as part of that review. When Ineos decided to stick with Ten Hag, they triggered the option for an additional year on his contract, which now runs to 2026.\n\nIn addition, significant elements of Ten Hag's backroom team were changed, including the exits of assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag and coach Steve McClaren. To add to the sense of change, in July Dan Ashworth and Omar Berrada finally came off respective periods of gardening leave to take up the sporting director and chief executive roles. This created the structures which Ineos felt United had lacked prior to Ratcliffe's part purchase of the club, which had been announced on 24 December the previous year. After an eighth-place finish, the club's worst of the Premier League era, optimism was high around Old Trafford about a significant improvement. On 29 September, United were hammered 3-0 at home by Tottenham. Questions began to be posed again about Ten Hag's tenure. On 30 September, officials at United let it be known that Ten Hag would stay in his job for the forthcoming games against Porto and Aston Villa. It was not stated the situation would be reassessed after those games, but that was an interpretation some made externally.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Friday, when asked directly in an on-camera interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan whether he \"had faith\" in Ten Hag, Ratcliffe replied: \"I don't want to answer that question. I like Erik. I think he's a very good coach but at the end of the day, it's not my call, it's the management team that's running Manchester United that have to decide how best we run the team in many different respects. \"They've not been there a long time, so they need to take stock and make some sensible decisions. \"Our objective is very clear \u2013 we want to take Manchester United back to where it should be, and it's not there yet, obviously \u2013 that's very clear.\" Ratcliffe's words made headlines - but were also interpreted by some as an indication some kind of decision would be reached after the Villa game. Ratcliffe, Berrada and Ashworth were part of the United delegation at Villa Park, who were all pictured sat together - alongside former manager Sir Alex Ferguson - at the top of the main stand for the 0-0 draw, which dropped United to 14th in the Premier League. Eight points from their opening seven games is United's worst return since the 1989-90 campaign.\n\nSo, after a week featuring two draws in very different styles - a chaotic 3-3 in Porto and a dour 0-0 at Villa - I asked Ten Hag two questions in his post-match news conference, firstly about the external noise and secondly if he felt the owners were still behind him. \"Simon, you said it very good, external noise,\" he replied. \"Internally we are disappointed and we know we have to do better.\u201d And on support from the ownership: \"I don't have any idea it is different because they should have told me. We communicate very open and very transparent.\" By Monday, some sort of clarification was expected from the club, which didn't come. Ratcliffe and co-chairman Joel Glazer were pictured going into Old Trafford. Glazer, it transpired, was attending a meeting of the club's Fan's Advisory Board. Club officials did communicate it was likely the performance of the team would be discussed at the board meeting in London the following day. Attendees were captured arriving and leaving but since then, nothing. Those at United whose responsibility it is to communicate messaging have questioned why they should offer guidance around this board meeting when they never do at any other point. As far as official statements go, there has been nothing. I approached United board member and Ineos Sport chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc for a comment at the European Clubs' Association meeting in Athens he is attending on his club's behalf. He politely declined. For now, Ten Hag remains in his job and he is having a few days away from the club as is customary during an international break. So unless the situation changes, he will return to begin preparations for the Premier League game with Brentford at Old Trafford on 19 October.",
    "A retired police officer is under a criminal investigation over the wrongful conviction of Andy Malkinson for a rape he did not commit, the police watchdog has said. The former Greater Manchester Police officer is being investigated for allegedly perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office in relation to Mr Malkinson\u2019s trial 20 years ago, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said. The former officer and three other officers, who are also retired, are also being investigated for alleged gross misconduct. Mr Malkinson was exonerated last year after suffering the longest miscarriage of justice of the 21st century.\n\nMr Malkinson protested his innocence throughout his 17 years in jail\n\nMr Malkinson said he felt vindicated by the IOPC investigation but he would \"not be satisfied until officers face real consequences\". \"If Greater Manchester Police get away with what they did to me, they'll keep doing it. It's as simple as that,\" he said. Judges at the Court of Appeal were told of long-undisclosed DNA evidence that showed another man must have been the rapist in an attack on a woman in 2003. No forensic evidence ever linked Mr Malkinson to the victim and he did not bear a facial injury that she had inflicted upon her attacker as she fought to defend herself. He did not look like her initial description of the rapist and there was no evidence to link him to the secluded scene of the crime, near Bolton. Mr Malkinson spent 17 years in jail protesting his innocence and a major judge-led inquiry is continuing into how the wrong man was convicted. The decision to investigate the four officers comes after the IOPC took over a review into how GMP had itself handled complaints from Mr Malkinson. An IOPC statement said that it was looking at how GMP came to identify Mr Malkinson as the key suspect and whether witnesses had been offered incentives to pick him out.\n\nThe watchdog said it was also investigating whether there had been a failure to disclose information that may have helped Mr Malkinson at his trial and it was also looking at whether officers followed the \u201cappropriate processes\u201d in how Mr Malkinson had been identified. The watchdog said it was also investigating how GMP handled and disposed of evidence. During Mr Malkinson\u2019s successful appeal last year, it emerged that the original DNA samples recovered from the victim and her clothing had been destroyed. Catherine Bates, IOPC Regional Director, said: \u201cMr Malkinson is a victim of one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history. \u201cFollowing a detailed review of evidence spanning a period of more than 20 years, we have now informed four retired GMP officers that they are under investigation for potential gross misconduct. \u201cOne of the officers has also been notified that they are under criminal investigation for potential misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice in relation to their actions during the police investigation and subsequent trial. \u201cWe will continue to keep Mr Malkinson and GMP updated on our progress.\u201d Emily Bolton, Mr Malkinson's lawyer at the legal charity APPEAL, welcomed the IOPC\u2019s decision to continue its investigation. \"Andy's wrongful imprisonment was not an unavoidable accident,\u201d she said. \u201cPolice accountability isn't optional - it's essential. Andy, his family, and the rape victim in this case all deserve justice.\"",
    "Israeli strikes on Iran kill four soldiers, Iran says\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Projectiles seen in sky over Tehran as Israel hits Iranian targets\n\nIsraeli strikes on Iran, in retaliation for Iran's missile attacks earlier this month, have killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran's army said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran \"recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,\" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks.\n\nTehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was \"limited damage\" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness \"to defend the state of Israel\". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be \"obliged to respond\".\n\nThe US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was \"targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm\" and suggested that was \"precisely what transpired\" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets \"in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates\". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against \"Iranian aggression\" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to \"de-escalate the situation across the region\". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed \"deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation\", while Jordan described the attack as a \"dangerous escalation\". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said \"what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation\". The extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. \"It was an echoing sound... terrible and horrifying,\" the agency quoted him as saying. \"Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it.\" Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF. Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.\n\nTehran at sunrise on Saturday morning, following Israeli strikes on sites around the Iranian capital",

    "Russian cash-for-votes flows into Moldova as nation heads to polls\n\nIlan Shor - pictured here while running for election in 2019 - fled the country before being sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement\n\nThe sniffer dogs at Chisinau Airport have been working extra hard in recent months, searching for money that might be evidence of Russian meddling in Moldovan politics. Ami, a black retriever, gives every suitcase that rolls in on the baggage claim belts a good sniff on all sides. If she detects cash, she will freeze. Back in May she was doing that a lot. That is when customs officers began finding large amounts of money on passengers arriving via connecting flights from Moscow. People who had never left Moldova before were returning from a few days in Russia with wads of notes. \u201cAlmost everyone had money: 2,000, 3,000, 7,000 euros\u201d, the head of customs at Chisinau Airport, Ruslan Alexandrov, remembers. The amounts themselves were not illegal but the patterns were suspicious. \u201cThere were certain flights: Moscow-Istanbul-Chisinau, Moscow-Yerevan-Chisinau,\u201d the customs chief explains. \u201cNormally people don\u2019t come in with that much money. Not from Moscow.\u201d\n\nSo police and prosecutors began seizing the cash. In one day alone they say they scooped $1.5m (\u00a31.2m). No-one ever asked for their money back. The authorities believe the cash mules were part of a major and ongoing operation to buy political influence run by a fugitive Moldovan oligarch named Ilan Shor. Convicted of major fraud in Chisinau, he is now resident in Russia which will not extradite him. Ahead of two key votes this weekend, the capital\u2019s airport is on alert. Flights from all \"high risk\" routes are met by sniffer dogs and at least half the passengers are pulled over for extra baggage scans.\n\u2022 None Explained: Decision time for two countries on future role in Europe On Sunday, President Maia Sandu is running for re-election on a staunchly pro-EU platform, challenged by 10 other candidates. Many are openly sympathetic to Moscow; some see Moldova as a \"bridge\". Voters will also get to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether to enshrine Moldova\u2019s goal of EU accession in the constitution. In fact, membership talks have already begun but the country has been in a battle over its political direction for decades, ever since Moldova gained independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union fell apart. That East-West tug has intensified since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Sandu \u2013 a former World Bank economist first elected on a promise to clean up corruption \u2013 then steered Moldova much more sharply towards the West. She began to openly identify Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia as a major security threat. The Kremlin denies playing any role in Chisinau politics, but officials here accuse Russia of operating via proxies to disrupt and destabilise the country.\n\nPresident Maia Sandu (right) is running for re-election\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anywhere else where we\u2019ve seen such a brazen and open attempt to corrupt an election,\u201d Moldova\u2019s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, Veronica Dragalin, told me this week in her office in Chisinau. Born in Moldova, she spent most of her life in the US \u2013 most recently as a prosecutor in Los Angeles \u2013 before returning to the country and a job in a small office on the fifth floor of a Soviet-era block with a broken lift. What her team say they have uncovered, working with police, is a pyramid payments scheme openly run from Russia by Ilan Shor and his group. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a foreign country sending money in an attempt to influence the election,\u201d Ms Dragalin spells it out. She details evidence gained through wiretaps, police infiltrators and witnesses \u2013 some of which her office has made public. \u201cAt the start they tried to make it look legitimate. Now it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re flagrantly flaunting all the laws\u2026 [and] openly influencing the decision to vote,\u201d the prosecutor says. \u201cThe primary goal is to have the referendum fail.\u201d According to her team, once the cash couriers were detected at the airport and that route made more difficult, payments began to be channelled via a sanctioned Russian bank, PSB. By early October as many as 130,000 voters had received payment through this scheme - about 10% of the active electorate, according to Viorel Cernauteanu, the chief of police. \u201cIn September alone, $15m (\u00a312m) was transferred,\u201d he told me, explaining how they could trace funds and recipients because they gave personal data to open a bank account. Offering money or goods in return for votes is a crime with a possible five-year jail sentence. Last month, a new law made it an administrative offence to accept money, too. But in one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries it is not hard to find willing recipients of cash.\n\nMoldovan investigators admit they cannot identify the source of funds paid into PSB bank \u2013 whether it is Russian state money, private capital or the cash Ilan Shor was convicted of stealing in Moldova. But he himself is very open about his actions and aims. In a typical recent post on TikTok, Shor called for a \u201cfirm NO\u201d to the EU. He then urged followers to choose \u201cthe president I decide on, as someone I can work with\u201d. In return he promised monthly top-up payments of 5,000 Moldovan lei to pensioners, or about \u00a3200. Shor fled Moldova in 2019 and was later sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement. Last year, his party was banned and he is also under Western sanctions, accused of \"malign influence campaigns\" for Russia. Media companies linked to him, Telegram channels and various political groupings have all been blocked. But his message \u2013 anti-EU, sympathetic to Moscow \u2013 still seeps through. Some remain receptive to that, as well as the cash.\n\nDeputy governor of Gagauzia spoke openly of his scorn for the EU\n\nThe deputy governor of Gagauzia, a small autonomous region of southern Moldova, also happens to respect Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tells me that is because he likes strong leaders who he thinks \"put their country first\". Russia\u2019s war on neighbouring Ukraine changed nothing on that score. He admires former US President Donald Trump for the same reason, whilst his scorn for the EU \u2013 which recently placed him under sanctions for \"destabilising activities\" \u2013 mainly focuses on LGBT rights, which he opposes virulently. Later, when I ask passers-by in the regional capital Comrat about the EU referendum, several reply that they\u2019ll vote \"no\" in order to keep \"gay parades\" from their town.\n\nA sign for the pro-Russian Victory party in Comrat, Gagauzia\n\nPro-Russian views and Kremlin-led narratives have always been strong in Gagauzia, where many still watch Russian state TV channels despite a national ban. Lately, Shor has been investing heavily here. The deputy governor repeatedly refers to him as \u201cour political leader\u201d and shrugs off the criminal conviction as if it were political. \u201cTry and say a bad word here about Ilan Shor and people will spit at you!\u201d, Uzun declares as we drive down Lenin Street past a statue of the Russian revolutionary, a little grubby but still intact. Many shop signs, those not in the local Gagauz language, are in Russian. I hear how Shor pays top-up pensions to 30,000 people in the region as well as re-tarmacking some 50 km (31 miles) of roads between remote villages, which we see. \u201cAll he does is for the people,\u201d Uzun enthuses.\n\nThe anti-corruption prosecutor later clarifies that using donations for social spending is not a crime. But channelling Shor\u2019s funds to political parties is an offence \u2013 and Uzun\u2019s boss, regional governor Evghenia Gutul, has been charged with that. After a while we roll up to a children\u2019s fairground. \u201cLook at Gagauziyaland, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Uzun beams, leading the way beneath a giant rainbow into a deserted but brand-new park.\n\nGagauziyaland, a children's playground, was almost deserted during our visit\n\nThe wind is bitterly cold and the mini dragon roller-coaster and merry-go-round we are looking at both stand empty and still. But Uzun insists people in Gagauzia will vote \u201chow Shor tells them\u201d - not for money, but because they trust him. \u201cAll the talk, that he\u2019s an arm of the Kremlin, destabilising Moldova: that\u2019s absolutely not true. This is the truth: what you see here,\u201d he waves towards the frozen fairground.\n\nWomen in traditional Moldovan dress welcomed President Maia Sandu at a campaign event on Friday\n\nOn Friday, Moldova\u2019s election campaign reached its climax. Maia Sandu was met for her own final rally in the small town of Telenesti, where women in traditional dress sang and supporters clapped as she passed. She has not taken part in election debates and did not want to speak to the BBC. But addressing a couple of hundred people through a microphone, Sandu urged Moldovans to vote for her and for the EU as the best path to peace. \u201cThis has been a very difficult campaign with a lot of lies and dirty money,\u201d she told them, asking voters to \u201cput our country out of harm\u2019s way\u201d and prevent her opponents \u201cderailing Moldova from its European path\u201d. That path has been a bumpy one for many years, with multiple diversions. Still, Moldova had already made its choice and opened accession talks with the EU. Now a referendum that Sandu initiated in an attempt to reinforce that goal and bolster her own support has turned into a risky political move. It looks like the presidential ballot is not the only vote she has to worry about on Sunday.",
    "Flies, rats and offers of hush money - the price of living next to a \u2018monster\u2019 incinerator\n\nGeorge and Mandy are among the residents who refused to sign an NDA agreement and can speak about the Runcorn incinerator\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with flies, rats, smell, noise. It's just been horrendous,\u201d says Mandy Royle, who lives in the closest home to the UK\u2019s biggest waste incinerator at Runcorn in Cheshire. The facility generates electricity from burning nearly a million tonnes of household rubbish every year - but much of that waste doesn't come from Ms Royle's local area. Like many incinerators, deliveries come from hundreds of miles away. BBC analysis suggests the burden of the UK's waste is disproportionately falling on deprived areas such as Runcorn, which are 10 times more likely to have an energy-from-waste incinerator in their midst than in the wealthiest areas.\n\nMany families nearby shared a \u00a31m settlement after 180 of them launched a legal action over the pollution and disturbances from the Runcorn incinerator, the BBC can reveal. But Ms Royle was one of a handful of people who did not sign the agreement, allowing her to speak out about life in the shadow of one of the UK's giant waste plants. \u201cI\u2019m just stuck in this little corner with a big monster staring at me and throwing what it does over me,\u201d she says. The others who took the cash, worth about \u00a34,500 per family after legal costs, had to sign a strict non-disclosure agreement (NDA). \u201cWell, I think they\u2019re being unfair in what they're paying, and completely unfair in what they are doing,\u201d says George Parker, who runs a local garage and also refused to sign the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a million-pound hush fund and a gagging order. That's why they're doing it, they\u2019re keeping everybody quiet.\u201d\n\nViridor, which runs the Runcorn plant, said it would not comment on the settlement or on the non-disclosure agreement. It said that noise and odour remained within permitted levels - regulated by the Environment Agency - and any complaints were fully investigated with feedback provided to residents.\n\nEnergy-from-waste incinerators have boomed over the past decade as local councils have faced higher charges to bury rubbish in landfill sites. This shift, though, has come at a big cost to the environment, with a BBC investigation showing that these plants now produce as much carbon per unit of energy than as if they were burning coal. It also comes at a cost to those who live near them, say Ms Royle and Mr Parker. \u201cThey put them in deprived areas, so people won\u2019t complain because they know the majority of the people are in such a state they don\u2019t know how to complain basically,\u201d Mr Parker says.\n\nOur investigation found breaches of air quality controls increased both at Runcorn and across incinerators in England between 2019 and 2023. These controls restrict the levels of gases such as carbon monoxide that can be emitted. The number of these permit breaches has risen from an average of 3.4 in 2019 to 5.5 per incinerator in 2023. Last year 73% of facilities in England reported transgressions. Runcorn\u2019s energy-from-waste site breached its permit 17 times in the past five years. \u201cThe Runcorn Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) operates within a strict Environmental Permit and is heavily regulated by the Environment Agency, meaning it must comply with all the necessary regulations and permit conditions,\u201d Viridor said in a statement. \u201cShould a permit limit be exceeded, a full and thorough investigation into the cause is carried out.\u201d Household waste is also being sent hundreds of miles across the country to be burned, or even sent abroad, BBC analysis of UK council data showed.\n\nResidents who live near the Runcorn incinerator have been psychologically impacted, says food bank manager Eddie Thompson\n\nIn one of the worst examples, waste from Derby City Council and Derbyshire Council ended up at 19 different incinerators in one year - from Milton Keynes to North Yorkshire. The increased movement of waste by train and lorry is producing even more carbon emissions and worsening local air pollution. A spokesperson for Derby City Council and Derbyshire County Council said the councils had signed a new contract which will reduce this number to 13, and that \u201creducing waste miles is a key part of our strategy.\u201d In another case, County Durham sent 1,300 tonnes of waste last year to an undisclosed incinerator facility in Cyprus, even though there are incinerators nearby in north-west England. The council said it was \"standard industry practice to divert waste from landfill through energy-from-waste facilities\".\n\nWhile Runcorn is home to the UK\u2019s biggest incinerator, a significant proportion of the town\u2019s local rubbish is not burned at the site. Instead, some of the waste from the borough of Halton, where Runcorn is located, and from other Merseyside towns, is sent by train about 150 miles across the country to the east coast, to be burned on Teesside. This whole area along the River Tees has emerged as a UK hotspot for energy-from-waste. The region is now home to three active incinerators, with three more in various stages of planning. \u201cWe have become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s rubbish by stealth,\u201d says an independent councillor in Redcar, Dr Tristan Learoyd. He says that incinerators in the area are tied into long-term contracts with councils across the country, which he believes will see large amounts of carbon emitted every year for decades to come. \u201cThere's a potential here for the number of incinerators to be in double figures,\u201d he says. \u201cFor my hometown, which has suffered a massive decline over the years, it's just another kick in the face. We're becoming the rubbish backyard of England.\u201d Linda Martin lives on the nearest street to the Wilton 11 incinerator in Billingham, Teesside, which burns more than 400,000 tonnes of rubbish every year. She questions whether people in the locality are seeing any direct economic benefit from the facility.\n\nDo you ever think about what happens to your rubbish after it\u2019s been taken away? Most of what we chuck in the bin is actually being burnt for energy. The BBC has found there's been a rapid rise in the burning of rubbish across the UK in recent years with major implications for the environment. For the 5 Questions On podcast, science reporter Esme Stallard explains.\n\n\u201cThis is our home and our area. Why should we have to put up with everything that we're putting up with?\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, we hear the noise constantly. We've got double glazing in, but it don't work. You still hear the noise!\u201d For Eddie Thompson MBE, who runs a busy food bank in Runcorn, the psychological impact of locating large-scale incinerators in poor areas is very important. \u201cMentally, people feel as though, in some cases, they are worthless. They have no sense of a future that they can see ahead of them. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Viridor, but are we getting it right?

    "Flood fears as Storm Bert heads into second day\n\nDrivers are being advised to be aware of surface water on the roads\n\nParts of Scotland are bracing for a second day of disruption with high winds and localised flooding after Storm Bert swept heavy snow and rain across the country. The central belt was hit by more snow than anticipated early on Saturday, causing widespread problems on the roads. The M8 saw long traffic jams and two of the main routes south - the M74 and A68 - were closed for a time due to accidents. Regional flood alerts have also been issued for parts of Dumfries and Galloway, west Borders, Central, Tayside, Aberdeenshire, Dundee and Angus regions. A yellow weather warning for wind in the Highlands and Argyll and Bute will come into place from 12:00.\n\nFlood warnings, external urging people to \"act now\" are also in place for four areas including the Churchill Barriers in Orkney, Strath Oykel in Sutherland and at the Carse of Lennoch and Crieff in Tayside.\n\nTraffic was diverted to the Forth Road Bridge from the Queensferry Crossing\n\nIn an unusual move, the Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth was closed due to the threat of falling ice on Saturday. Traffic in the area was diverted via the Forth Road Bridge. The diversion remained in place until 01:00 on Sunday. David Bishop from the national road maintenance body Bear Scotland said the closure was due to concerns that ice sticking to the bridge's 70km of cable stays could fall and cause a \"significant road traffic incident\". It is the first time since 2021 the bridge has closed. All 700 buses in the Lothian Buses fleet ground to a halt for much of Saturday due to tough road conditions. The company announced services were back to normal early on Saturday evening. Edinburgh sightseeing buses were cancelled and there was disruption on Citylink, McGill's and First services. A dramatic image shared on social media showed a bus which had left the road at Buchlyvie, a village in the Stirling area.\n\nThere were accidents across the road network as drivers struggled with the poor conditions\n\nGeorge Henry, head of road safety and road policy for Transport Scotland, said the conditions had been \"challenging\". He said: \"We have been treating our roads around the clock, our operating companies have been out and we have used over 240 gritters. \"Unfortunately there has been some impacts with various vehicles being stuck due to some vehicles losing traction at various location and we\u2019ve tried to treat that as quickly as we can to minimise the disruption to the motoring public.\"\n\nMr Henry said particular incidents had impacted the M8 near Livingston and the M74 at various points on Saturday. He added attention is now turning to the risk of localised flooding caused by the temperature rising and snow melting. \"There will be lots of surface water so we urge the motoring public when they are returning to the roads to please take care and drive to the conditions they are faced with,\" he added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA total of 11 SPFL games were called off with kick-off times delayed on another three, including two in the Premiership. One of those called off was a league two match between Cove Rangers and Stenhousemuir, after the away team's bus got stuck in snow at Broxden Services outside Perth. Over 3,000 homes in England and Wales are without power. Scotland has not been hit as hard, with both Scottish Power and SSE reporting just a few localised faults. The Met Office has warned a rapid thaw and subsequent rain may cause further disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain and snow remained in place for most of Scotland until 09:00 on Sunday. The Highlands and Argyll and Bute will see winds of up to 65mph on Sunday, with a yellow warning in place from 12:00 until 00:00.

    "Tony Chambers, pictured with members of his legal team, did not contact the police for almost a year after first being made aware of concerns about Lucy Letby\n\nThe former chief executive of the hospital where Lucy Letby murdered seven babies said the father of the serial killer \"made threats\" in \"angry meetings\". Tony Chambers was in charge at the Countess of Chester hospital during 2015 and 2016, when the nurse also attempted to murder seven other infants. Mr Chambers told the public inquiry into the circumstances around Letby's offending that he and his fellow board members \"simply didn't see\" what was behind the rising death rate amongst babies on the neonatal unit. He also apologised to the families of Letby's victims \"for the pain that may have been prolonged by any decisions or actions that I took in good faith\".\n\nNicholas de la Poer KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Chambers about meetings he held with Letby and her family in December 2016. This came after managers upheld a grievance she had lodged with the hospital in September that year, about being removed from the neonatal unit and placed onto clerical duties due to accusations against her by senior consultants.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Telling Letby 'we've got your back' was 'clumsy' says ex-hospital boss\n\nThe Thirlwall Inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall heard that during that meeting, Mr Chambers told Letby she would be returning to the unit and accepted saying to her: \"For your resilience Lucy, you astound me.\u201d He said Letby's father, John Letby, wanted to report the consultants who accused his daughter of harming babies to the regulator the General Medical Council (GMC). \"Letby\u2019s father was very angry, he was making threats,\" he said. \"He was making threats that would have made an already difficult situation even worse by threatening GMC referrals for the doctors. \"He was threatening guns to my head.\"\n\nJohn and Susan Letby, the parents of Lucy Letby, demanded action against the doctors who suspected the serial killer of harming babies\n\nMr Chambers said he felt he had \"perhaps\" not handled that meeting well but said he was trying to \"take the heat out\u201d of the situation with Letby\u2019s father. At one meeting, Letby demanded any mention of her being taken off the unit be removed from her personnel file, and said she wanted \"four apologies\" from the consultants who had raised suspicions about her. Mr de la Poer asked: \"Would you agree that this was deeply manipulative behaviour?\" Mr Chambers replied: \"I didn\u2019t feel that I was being manipulated at the time.... \"It was the father who seemed to be pulling the strings rather than Letby herself.\" He accepted he told her \"don't worry Lucy, we've got your back\", which he said in hindsight was \"clumsy language\".\n\nWeekly updates from the public inquiry examining the murders committed by Lucy Letby\n\nHe also told her a review of neonatal mortality by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in September 2016 had \"vindicated\" her. Mr Chambers told the inquiry he accepts the RCPCH review did not vindicate Letby because it had not investigated any link between her and the deaths - although he said it did not indicate anything suspicious. \"I was very conscious to try as much as possible to avoid further escalation particularly from her father\", he said. Mr de la Poer asked: \"If it was an attempt by Lucy Letby to take control and get what she wanted, and go on the offensive, she succeeded in recruiting you to that. Mr Chambers said: \"No I don\u2019t think so at all\", adding that he believed Letby just wanted to \"get back to the job she loved\".\n\nLucy Letby was allowed to work on the unit for one more day after chief executive Tony Chambers first learned of concerns about her\n\nEarlier the inquiry heard that Mr Chambers held a meeting with consultant paediatricians on 29 June 2016, which, he said, was the first time he had been told there were concerns about Letby's links to unexplained deaths and collapses of babies. He told the inquiry the concerns about Letby were \"very shocking\" to hear, but that \"we wouldn't jump to criminality as the causal factor\". Mr Chambers said: \"There was strong rebuttal to the proposition that this one nurse was deliberately causing harm. \"There was a very strong level of support for this individual.\" Letby was due to go on leave for a fortnight after 30 June and afterwards was placed onto clerical duties, never returning to the unit. Mr de la Poer asked about a meeting on 27 March 2017, when consultant Dr Stephen Brearey told Mr Chambers the police should be called in. Mr Chambers said that at that meeting the agreement was made to contact police, but he did not write to the chief constable of Cheshire Constabulary until 2 May, after consulting with criminal barrister Simon Medland QC. However, Mr de la Poer suggested that, in his initial contact with the police, Mr Chambers \"did not present the case at its highest\" and was trying to \"discourage\" an investigation. Mr Chambers responded \"absolutely not\", and said the hospital \"shared with police very openly and candidly what we genuinely believed to be the position as we understood it at the time\".",

    "Alleged spy 'talked about going to Iran for training', court hears\n\nA former British army soldier who is accused of being a spy for Iran and escaping from Wandsworth Prison last year offered to go for training in Iran, a court heard. The jury at his Woolwich Crown Court trial heard the recording of a conversation that the prosecution said was between Daniel Khalife and two Iranian contacts in November 2021. Mr Khalife, now 23, is accused of gathering information for Iran, compiling a list of special forces soldiers, perpetrating a bomb hoax and escaping prison. He denies all the charges.\n\nIn the recording, Mr Khalife apparently discusses with the two men whether he should travel to Iran or to Lebanon. One of the men, who seems to be the more senior, suggests that Lebanon is the better option. Mr Khalife then says: \"I wanted to have some training from you guys, and I think the best training for me is inside of Iran.\" But the man, speaking with a strong Iranian accent, says Lebanon is better: \"Yes, there we can train you and because we have a safe place there - yes.\" \"Your safety and healthiness is much important for us,\" he says. The man adds: \"We don\u2019t want any dangers for you and the planning for Lebanon. If this is better, if this is good we can plan a safe meeting here.\" Mr Khalife says he is about to have a month\u2019s holiday starting in mid-December. His Iranian contact asks: \"This is not sensitive for you travelling to Lebanon?\" Mr Khalife says: \"It is sensitive. I have to plan. I can\u2019t pay with my credit card. So what I have to do is pay in cash. I will use the money that you gave me.\" The prosecution said the recording of the conversation was recovered from Mr Khalife\u2019s own iPad. There is no evidence that Mr Khalife ever travelled to Iran or Lebanon. Earlier, the jury were read transcripts of two conversations Mr Khalife had with MI5 call handlers after he phoned their publicly available phone number. In the first call, he said he had been approached by an Iranian man and that he had started sending them fabricated documents. He said that he had collected a sum of money in \u00a320 notes in a dog poo bag from Mill Hill Park in North London, and said a year later he had collected \u00a31,000 pounds from under a pot in a cemetery in Kensal Green in West London. In the next call, he questions why he has not received a call back.\n\nIn court yesterday, prosecutors said Mr Khalife - whose role in the Royal Corps of Signals gave him access to highly sensitive information - had offered to work as an agent for Iran in messages to Iranian intelligence handlers. The court also heard that he won a cup for Best Junior Soldier in his squadron, and was recommended for promotion to Lance Corporal aged just 20.\n\nThe jury has heard that Mr Khalife was first arrested in January 2022, and charged in January 2023. He is alleged to have escaped from Wandsworth prison eight months later by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery van before being recaptured after three days.",

    "Salmond's body to be brought home on private flight\n\nA private individual is paying for a charter flight to bring Alex Salmond\u2019s body back to Scotland from North Macedonia. The former first minister died suddenly from a heart attack in the Balkan country on Saturday at the age of 69. There had been calls for an RAF flight to repatriate his body, but it is now confirmed a private charter flight - paid for independently - will fly to Aberdeen. A private family funeral will be held for the Alba Party leader, followed by a public memorial event at a later date.\n\nNo timeline for Salmond's repatriation has been publicly announced but the Alba Party said details would be made available in due course.\n\nActing Alba Party leader Kenny MacAskill said Salmond\u2019s family were \u201cgrateful\u201d to the private citizen who had chartered the flight. He said: \u201cIt brings a great deal of comfort to Moira and other members of the family to know that he will soon be home with them. \"The family have asked that their privacy be respected at this time and will be making an announcement in due course about the funeral arrangements and a memorial service to honour the life of Alex Salmond.\" The statement also thanked the North Macedonian government for expediting the process of releasing his body and both the Scottish and UK governments for their \u201cendeavours\u201d to put plans in place. The Scottish government said it had been a \"complex\" process. A spokesperson said: \u201cOver the last few days the Scottish government and UK government have been engaging with Alex Salmond\u2018s family and working closely together in accordance with their wishes, to ensure the swift and dignified repatriation of the former first minister to Scotland. \u201cHaving explored a number of options, the family have now made arrangements for this to take place with the support of a private citizen.\"\n\nThere is a book of condolence at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh\n\nFriends of Salmond, including the Conservative MP David Davis, had been lobbying the UK government to allow the RAF to fly his body to Scotland. Such arrangements are usually reserved for members of the Royal Family. Chris McEleny, general secretary of the Alba Party, had called on the UK government to allow Salmond's body to be flown directly back to Scotland as it would be quicker than using a commercial flight. He told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"For all that he\u2019s done for Scotland, I think it\u2019s the least that we can do for him.\" Salmond had been attending an Academy for Cultural Diplomacy (ACD) event in Ohrid on Saturday when he took unwell.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nACD director Mark Donfried said he had returned to North Macedonia from his home in Germany to help ensure Salmond was repatriated as soon as possible. He told BBC Scotland News: \"I was taught as a I grew up you don't leave any man behind and, here, I definitely feel a responsibility to make sure that everything goes perfectly with the highest level of respect.\" Tributes have been paid to former SNP leader Salmond from across the political spectrum in recent days. During Prime Ministers' Questions, Sir Keir Starmer described him as a \"monumental figure in Scottish and UK politics\". Tory leader Rishi Sunak and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey also paid tribute in the Commons. Scotland football fans held a minute's applause before Tuesday's match against Portugal at Hampden.",
    "Emma and James Richardson say they found themselves \"haemorrhaging money\" after buying a holiday home\n\nWhen James and Emma Richardson bought a \u00a3110,000 caravan at a holiday park in Lincolnshire, they hoped it would benefit their whole family. The couple, from Cleethorpes, used money left to Mrs Richardson by her parents \u2013 who died in 2017 and 2018 \u2013 to put down a \u00a325,000 deposit and entered into a finance agreement to pay for the rest. They wanted to let relatives use the caravan at Tattershall Lakes for free holidays and also rent it out to the public to offset the cost. Mrs Richardson, 43, said: \"I wanted to do something for the family. It was my way of being able to have them gain from me inheriting. \u201cMum and Dad were very hard-working, very loving. Family was everything.\"\n\nThe Richardsons said a Tattershall Lakes salesperson assured them they would make enough income from hiring out their caravan to cover their monthly finance repayments of \u00a31,269. Away Resorts, which runs the park and manages rentals, denies any such promise was made. A spokesperson told the BBC the company was clear with caravan owners that \"there are no guarantees\" about subletting income. The Richardsons said they found themselves \"haemorrhaging money\" after buying their caravan. \u201cWe had months where we were taking \u00a31,200 in rental costs, but we would only receive \u00a3200 of that because of linen charges, [visitor] passes, cleaning fees,\u201d said Mr Richardson, 46. \u201cWe were so far short of what we were sold.\u201d\n\nEmma and James Richardson lost more than \u00a350,000 over two years\n\nThe couple soon decided to cut their losses and offered to sell their caravan back to the park. After this offer was rejected, the Richardsons paid \u00a320,000 and handed over their caravan to get out of their third-party finance agreement. \"We lost, over a period of two years, in excess of \u00a350,000, which has just crippled us,\" Mr Richardson said. \u201cI'm still paying credit cards off now. We've lost that inheritance that our parents worked all their lives for.\u201d Mrs Richardson said losing the money her parents had left was a \u201cbitter pill to swallow\u201d. She added: \u201cIf it was just my money it would be completely different, but because it\u2019s what my parents worked for\u2026 I felt like I\u2019d let them down.\"\n\nSkipsea in East Yorkshire is home to hundreds of holiday caravans\n\nSince a boom in the 1960s, caravan holidays at Britain's seaside resorts and rural beauty spots have been a popular choice among families looking for an affordable getaway. Today there are more than 3,000 parks across the UK. Caravan and camping holidays brought \u00a37.2bn into the economy last year, according to industry figures. The British Holiday and Home Parks Association (BHHPA), the national trade body for the sector, says these sites bring \"vital tourism\" and investment \"to some of the UK\u2019s most economically challenged areas\". The National Caravans Council (NCC), which also represents the industry, said there were \"many thousands of happy holiday caravan owners across the UK\". But the Richardsons are not the only family to feel they have been left out of pocket by the dream of owning a holiday home. Dozens of people have told the BBC they lost significant sums of money \u2013 some of them their life savings, pensions or inheritance \u2013 after buying a static caravan. The founder of a group set up to support caravan owners said it was \"scandalous\" that \"people's lives are being ruined\".\n\nAndrew and Sue Dawson bought a static caravan at a holiday park on the East Yorkshire coast in 2022, they planned to spend their retirement whiling away weekends at the seaside with their daughters and grandchildren. Then they received some devastating news. In February this year, Mr Dawson, 59, was diagnosed with incurable cancer. \"The doctors gave me between six months and \u2013 as they described it \u2013 a few short years,\" he said. \"Obviously we started talking about the future. It completely changed everything.\" The couple, from Leeds, began getting their affairs in order and decided to sell their caravan at Parkdean's Skipsea Sands resort. But they were in for another shock. The three-bedroom caravan with decking, for which they had paid \u00a362,400 in 2022, was worth just \u00a317,000 two years later. \u201cWe were gobsmacked,\u201d said Mr Dawson. \u201cNo one ever told us we\u2019d face that level of depreciation. \"The salesman sold us the dream, but didn't sell us the reality.\"\n\nAndrew and Sue Dawson enjoyed spending time with their granddaughters at Skipsea Sands\n\nParkdean\u2019s website states that \u201cbuying a holiday home isn't considered a financial investment, as holiday homes depreciate in value with age\u201d. But Mr Dawson said a Skipsea Sands salesperson told him caravans \"pretty much hold their value\". Only when the Dawsons came to sell, following the cancer diagnosis, did they realise they could recoup only a fraction of their expenditure. The couple reluctantly agreed to sell their caravan back to the park for \u00a317,000 after negotiating with the sales team. But on the day the Dawsons cleared out their caravan to finalise the sale, Parkdean cut the price they were willing to pay to \u00a316,000.\n\nAndrew Dawson was diagnosed with stage four cancer in February\n\nMr Dawson said his dealings with the park had been \"dreadful\". \"The amount of money we've lost and the way we\u2019ve been treated, in my opinion is very underhanded and lacking in transparency,\" he added. He said he felt there had been \"a complete lack of empathy, really, knowing my condition, knowing why were selling \u2013 that we didn't really have a lot of choice\". \"We feel they let us down very badly.\"\n\nThe Dawsons paid \u00a362,000 for their caravan with additional decking\n\nAfter the BBC contacted Parkdean, a Skipsea Sands manager called Mr Dawson and offered to pay him \u00a31,000 to resolve the dispute. A Parkdean spokesperson said the company was \"aware of and sympathetic to Andrew\u2019s situation\" and had contacted Mr Dawson \"to agree a suitable offer and settle the matter\". But Mr Dawson said it was \"never about the money,\" adding: \"It doesn't change my view on Parkdean and it doesn't change my view on the industry.\"\n\nSally Nicholls, 70, from Sheffield, used her entire pension pot and a small loan to buy a \u00a369,000 static caravan at Tattershall Lakes in 2021. She said she told a salesperson she planned to live off the rental income in her retirement and was given figures indicating what she could expect to make. \u201cAt the time, it looked like a good proposition,\" she added. Ms Nicholls did make a small profit from her caravan in her first year as an owner, but her takings quickly dried up after repeated increases in park charges, which she was forced to pass on to customers. She then found herself in competition with the park itself, which was able to offer more favourable rates, including free access to facilities, to prospective guests. \"That more or less put a complete halt to the bookings coming in,\" Ms Nicholls said.\n\nSally Nicholls sold her house after losing money on a caravan purchase\n\nMs Nicholls decided to sell her caravan but, like the Dawsons, was shocked at how little it was now worth. After Tattershall Lakes declined to buy it back, she ended up selling to an outside trader for \u00a317,500. \u201cIt came as quite a shock to realise that I wasn\u2019t going to get my pension back to live on in old age,\" said Ms Nicholls, who has since sold her house to free up funds for her retirement and moved to a smaller property in Bolsover. \"I had to consider what I was going to live on,\" she added. \"The only option for me was to sell my home.\" Away Resorts said it provided all prospective buyers with \u201ccomprehensive information, including detailed terms and conditions\u201d to ensure they had \u201cfull awareness of the potential risks and rewards\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cWhile subletting a holiday home can be a way for some owners to generate additional income, we make it clear that there are no guarantees in relation to this, as various factors \u2013 including seasonal demand and wider economic conditions \u2013 can influence returns.\u201d\n\nIbraheem Dulmeer, a barrister who specialises in holiday park law, said caravan buyers were not always fully informed about the agreements they were signing. He said it was \"really, really essential\" buyers did \"due diligence\" and got any promises from salespeople in writing. \u201cMany people from the outset are not provided with any legal advice or don\u2019t obtain any legal advice, they simply go through shaking hands, handing over large sums of money,\" Mr Dulmeer added. \"And what seems to happen is that, as a result of that, they aren\u2019t actually afforded the opportunity to review the terms, review the conditions, and see whether it fits for them. And that\u2019s where most of the problems really stem from.\"\n\nThe BHHPA, which represents holiday parks, said it was important consumers \"read the small print\" and \"fully understand the sales contract\" before committing to buying a caravan. A spokesperson for the NCC, the trade organisation for the industry, said holiday caravan ownership was \"a significant purchase decision\" and potential buyers should conduct their own research to \"fully understand what they are buying\". They added: \"We work with our member parks to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities to help consumers understand clearly what they are buying, when and how they can use their holiday caravan or lodge, and that they treat all customers fairly and honestly using simple language and following best practice.\" Caravan owners are protected by consumer rights laws, which are enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and local Trading Standards offices. The CMA, a government regulator, told the BBC it could not comment on specific cases, but said businesses must not mislead their customers and any claims about products \"must be honest and transparent\".\n\nLast year, a petition signed by more than 27,000 people, which called for protections to be strengthened, was rejected by the Conservative government. The petition was started by the Holiday Park Action Group, which has more than 66,000 members in a Facebook group in which caravan buyers voice complaints. Its founder Carole Keeble said consumers were \"consistently misled in respect of the true value of the caravans they are buying\" and claimed the CMA was failing to act. She told the BBC it was a \"national scandal that people are losing their pensions, inheritance or having to sell their own homes to cover the losses they are incurring\". Meanwhile, Ms Nicholls said she wanted a regulator to \"step up and take control\" of the sector. She added: \"It's had a devastating impact on me.

    "Online fraudsters are selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies, the Daily Express reports\n\nThe build-up to next week's budget continues to lead many of the papers. The Daily Telegraph, external says Chancellor Rachel Reeves' plan to change the government's fiscal rules will \"unleash a borrowing spree of up to \u00a350bn\". The Daily Mail s, externalays the figure equates to \u00a31,750 per household. The shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is quoted saying the plan risks pushing up interest rates and \"punishing families with mortgages\". Writing in the Financial Times, external, Reeves says \"guardrails\" will be in place to ensure prudent spending. There's also a warning for Reeves at the prospect of imposing national insurance on employers' pension contributions - a policy that could raise \u00a315bn. In a letter to the Times, external, former work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett describes the potential measure as \"very worrying\" because it could lead to employers reducing pension contributions. That would come at a time when the government's own figures show four in ten private sector workers are not saving enough for an adequate income in retirement. The proposed ban on smoking in pub gardens is, according to the Sun, external, \"running out of puff\" and on the verge of being dropped. The paper says smoking is now only to be prohibited outside schools and hospitals. The Guardian reports, external that there was \"fierce opposition from the hospitality trade\" to the plan. No 10 officials also privately believe banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is an \"unserious policy\" and not backed by good evidence to show non-smokers are harmed. \"Time to listen\", is the message from the Daily Mirror, external on the subject of the UK paying reparations for its role in the slave trade. But the Daily Telegraph's editorial , externalsays there is \"no case\" for Britain to answer - and such demands for cash \"stand on shaky moral ground\". The Daily Mail's, external editorial takes aim at the prime minister's handling of the row. It says \"canny politicians\" from elsewhere in the Commonwealth - who are \"astute at spotting the weakest link\" - appear to have outsmarted him by securing a debate on reparations.\n\nAn investigation by the Daily Express, external has found online fraudsters are ripping off the Royal British Legion's annual appeal by selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies. One website reportedly bragged that its produce was \"suitable for Remembrance Day activities... to honour the lives and memories of fallen soldiers\". The shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, has described the rip off merchants as \"disgraceful\". The Royal British Legion has urged people to only buy poppies from its trusted sellers.

    "The government has ordered a review of physician associates (PA) and anaesthesia associates (AA) in England after mounting concern about their use in the NHS. The number of PAs and AAs, who help doctors, are in the process of being rapidly expanded. But the British Medical Association has voiced concerns they are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and the lines with doctors are getting blurred. Announcing the review, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said there were legitimate concerns that needed looking at but he also criticised the \"toxic nature of the debate\", saying it had left PAs feeling demoralised.\n\nThe review will look at how they are being deployed and what safeguards are needed going forward. Streeting said: \"Many physician associates are providing great care and freeing up doctors to do the things only doctors can do. \"But there are legitimate concerns over transparency for patients, scope of practice, and the substituting of doctors. \"These concerns have been ignored for too long, leading to a toxic debate where physicians feel ignored and PAs feel demoralised.\" He said he hoped the review would \"take the heat out of the issue\" and make sure \"we get the right people, in the right place, doing the right thing\u201d. The review will be led by Prof Gillian Leng, a former chief executive of the NHS drugs advisory body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It will report back early next year to inform the government\u2019s new 10-year plan for the NHS.\n\nThe current NHS workforce plan sees PAs and AAs as a crucial part of the staffing mix in the health service. The numbers have been gradually increasing in recent years, but the plan, published last year, called for a rapid expansion from just over 3,000 to 12,000 by 2036. PAs can work in GP surgeries and hospitals. They are not authorised to prescribe, but they can order some scans, take medical histories and conduct physical examinations. AAs, which support surgery teams, are a much smaller group - there are only about 100 in the NHS. Both PAs and AAs have to complete a two-year master\u2019s degree. They usually need a bioscience-related first degree, but that is not a prerequisite. British Medical Association leader Dr Phil Banfield called for the rollout of new PAs to be paused while the review takes place. And he added: \"The NHS must tell us how they are going to keep patients safe while this review is carried out. \u201cYou do not fly a plane under safety review, you ground it.\" Last week the BBC reported on the death of 77-year-old Susan Pollitt who died in 2023 at Royal Oldham Hospital after a drain was mistakenly left in her abdomen for too long. The inquest into her death concluded it had been caused by an \"unnecessary medical procedure contributed to by neglect\". She received treatment from a PA alongside other staff. Following Mrs Pollitt\u2019s inquest, North Manchester coroner Joanne Kearsley warned about the use of PAs. She said there was a lack of regulation and national framework covering training, supervision and competency, and limited understanding and awareness about the role among both patients and other NHS staff. She also said the lack of a distinct uniform and the title \"physician\" was giving rise to confusion as to whether the practitioner is a doctor.\n\nThe issue of regulation should be addressed next month when the General Medical Council starts regulating PAs and AAs. In September, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which has been broadly supportive of the expansion of the role, accepted a review was needed given the concerns being expressed. But the academy was critical of the \"increasingly acrimonious and destructive debate\" which it said had been fuelled by unsubstantiated comments on social media and was damaging teamwork across the health service. Stephen Nash, head of United Medical Associate Professionals, which represents PAs, said the review would be a chance to \"shine a real light\" on what is going on and provided much needed evidence in a \"very one-sided debate\". Louise Ansari, head of patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said she welcomed the review too. She said patients had reported \"very positive\" interactions with PAs, but she had particular concerns about the fact patients were not always told or made aware they were being seen by a PA.\n\nAre you a PA, AA or a doctor who has been affected?

    "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk. Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said. Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.\n\nThere are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand. Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended. \"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\". Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\". The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\". It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high. However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year. Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024. For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can. But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.\n\nStellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it. Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary. Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection. Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans. Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation. It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton. But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\". \u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said. Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932. At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued. Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.\n\nFactory workers in the engine production line at the Vauxhall car plant in Luton in 1954\n\nNissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\". Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs. The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable. Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\". The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\". The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\".\n\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?",

    "Workers could get right to strike for a year\n\nThe government is considering giving workers twice as long to strike. Under existing legislation, if workers vote to take industrial action, the mandate expires after six months and unions are required to hold another ballot to extend it. But a consultation document produced by the government said the mandate could be extended to a year. It said due to unions being \"very likely'' win a second ballot, keeping the six-month rule would ''add administrative costs'' to them.\n\nRailway staff, train drivers, doctors and teachers are just some of the groups that have staged walk outs in recent times. The walk outs across different sectors and industries over the past couple of years have resulted in more than 5.7 million working days have been lost, the highest number for more than 30 years, according to official figures. Ministers argue that by making it easier for unions to organise, it would lead to a more co-operative relationship with employers and lessen the need for industrial action. The government is proposing to also abolish the requirement that 50% of a workforce turns out to vote. It is looking to get rid of the rule that for \"important public services\" such as the NHS, some 40% of the workforce must have voted in favour of industrial action for it to go ahead. The BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment over the proposals. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, said the government's policies under the Employment Rights Bill were aimed at \"repealing the anti-worker, anti-union laws, and turning the page on industrial relations\". The Employment Rights Bill is a major shake-up of workers' rights, but the reforms proposed are still being worked out and it is still unclear how some will work in practice. Conservative Shadow Business Secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, has urged the government to withdraw the Employment Rights Bill and \"think again\". He said the proposed legislation created \"existential crisis of a magnitude not seen since the pandemic\" for jobs and business people. The government's own analysis released earlier this week said Labour's plans to upgrade workers' rights would cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year to implement.\n\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the union welcomed the government's \"commitment to introduce a modern framework for industrial relations\". Under the bill, the government plans to make to easier for unions to be recognised by employers and companies. A main function of a union is to represent workers in negotiations with their employers over pay and working conditions. At present, 10% of a workforce must be union members for an application to be made to get recognition, but it has been proposed this could be lowered to 2%. Under existing rules, 40% of a workforce must vote in favour of recognition, but under the government's new proposals, that threshold would be abolished. Trade unions have argued that it is too easy for companies to employ extra employees to make it harder for them to reach the required thresholds to be recognised. In July, the GMB trade union lost a vote for recognition at the Amazon Fulfilment Centre in Coventry by 28 votes. The union accused the company of packing out the warehouse with surplus workers in an effort to thwart their bid for recognition. Amazon denied doing so and said it recruited the workers as part of normal business planning.",
    "What happens to Trump\u2019s convictions and legal cases after election win?\n\nTrump is the first person with a felony conviction to serve as president\n\nDonald Trump will be the first president to take office while several criminal cases against him are pending. His ascent to the highest office in the US while facing dozens of criminal charges has left the country in uncharted territory. Many of his legal problems will go away when he steps into the White House. Discussions already have started between Trump's team and the office overseeing federal cases about how to wind those down, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Here's a look at what could happen with each of the four legal challenges he faces.\n\nDonald Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York. A jury of New Yorkers found him guilty of all counts in connection with a hush-money payment made to an adult film star. Judge Juan Merchan pushed back Trump's sentencing from September to 26 November, after the election. He could still go forward with the sentencing as planned despite Trump's win, said former Brooklyn prosecutor Julie Rendelman. But legal experts said it is unlikely that Trump would be sentenced to prison as an older, first-time offender. If he was, his lawyers would appeal the sentence immediately, arguing that jail time would prevent him from conducting official duties and that he should remain free pending the appeal, Ms Rendelman said. \"The appellate process in that scenario could go on for years,\" she said.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith filed criminal charges against Trump last year over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The case has been in legal limbo since the Supreme Court ruled this summer that Trump was partially immune from criminal prosecution over official acts committed while in office. Smith has since refiled his case, arguing Trump's attempts to overturn the election were not related to his official duties. This is one of the cases which could be wound down under current discussions.\n\nAs president-elect, Trump's criminal problems from the case now \"go away\", according to former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. \"It's well established that a sitting president can't be prosecuted, so the election fraud case in DC District Court will be dismissed,\" he said. Mr Rahmani said that if Smith refuses to dismiss the case, Trump can simply get rid of him, as he has pledged to do already. \"I would fire him within two seconds,\" Trump said during a radio interview in October.\n\nSmith also is leading a case against Trump over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House, charges Trump denies. He is accused of storing sensitive documents in his Mar-a-Lago home and obstructing Justice Department efforts to retrieve the files. The judge assigned to the case, Trump-appointee Aileen Cannon, dismissed the charges in July, arguing Smith was improperly appointed by the Justice Department to lead the case. Smith appealed the ruling, but with Trump set to take office, talks are now underway about ending the case. Mr Rahmani said he expects the classified documents case will meet the same fate as the election case. \"The DOJ will abandon its Eleventh Circuit appeal of the dismissal of the classified documents case,\" he said.\n\nTrump is also facing criminal charges in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state. That case has faced a number of hurdles, including efforts to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis over her relationship with a lawyer she hired to work on the case. An appeals court is in the process of weighing whether Willis should be allowed to stay on the case. But now that Trump is the next president, the case could face even more delays, or possibly dismissal. It is expected to be paused during Trump's time in office, according to legal experts. Trump's lawyer Steve Sadow said as much when asked by the judge if Trump could still stand trial if elected. \"The answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\" he said.\n\nIn theory, yes. A president has never pardoned himself before, so the move would be unprecedented. But presidential pardons only apply to federal cases. Trump has only been convicted of 34 state felony charges, so he would not be able to pardon himself in the New York hush-money case.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

She then rang the Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) flood incident helpline to ask for sandbags. \"I made them aware of the situation in the street, the water was coming up the manholes,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\nSarah Kirkwood says she was talking to her neighbours from their upstairs windows while they were stuck inside their houses\n\nMs Kirkwood explained that the area was prone to flooding, but the water had never entered her home before. \"It comes about halfway up the street every year and they've been doing works... so we thought it was all in hand,\" she added. After leaving to get sandbags, Ms Kirkwood arrived back to find her property had flooded, which left her frustrated. Despite the turn of events, Ms Kirkwood said she is \"fortunate\" to have family she can stay with while the damage in her home is dealt with.

The earlier heavy rain combined with snow melt has led to flooding in many areas as rivers burst their banks. Flooding will continue to be a hazard as snow melt feeds down into the river network. According to the Met Office: \"Strong south-westerly winds are expected to develop during Sunday morning across Northern Ireland. \"Gusts of 45-55 mph are expected widely with gusts of up 65 mph possible over hills and exposed locations around the coast.\" The top wind gusts will be similar to those of Saturday and therefore could cause some further damage and disruption.",
    "Met faces service cuts without more cash, says chief\n\nThe boss of the UK's largest police force has warned it faces \"eye-watering cuts\" to services unless ministers increase its funding. Met commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told the BBC he was \"deeply troubled\" by talks so far on its annual settlement for next year. He added that the force was in a \"precarious position\" because previously used options to \"prop up\" its budget were no longer available. The government has said it plans to increase the overall policing budget next year - although allocations by force are still to be negotiated.\n\nThe Met's budget for this year is just over \u00a33.5bn, a 3.5% increase from 2023/24, comprising \u00a32.6bn from central government and \u00a3956m from local taxes. Sir Mark said conversations over its funding allocation from next April - which would normally be expected to be announced in December or January - were still \"ongoing\" with the government and City Hall. But, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, he said he was \"deeply troubled by the situation we appear to be heading towards\". Policing a global capital such as London came with an \"extra set of challenges\", he said, adding that spending per person was lower than in other cities such as New York and Sydney. He said that the \"cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so\" had put the force in a \"more and more precarious position\", and some of its buildings would be \"unusable\" in a few years without further investment. \u201cSome of the things that successive [police] commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out,\" he added. \u201cThe chancellor has been very clear - it's a difficult public sector context.\"\n\n\"You add all those things together, and you get a dramatic change in budgets of a scale that's never going to be absorbed by efficiencies, and is going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to London.\" He added that he was not going to get into detail at this stage on the \"tough choices\" the force would face without an increase in resources. But he said he planned to specify \"10 or 20 things we're going to do differently\" before Christmas. He added that the implications for policing in the capital would \"become more public\" in the coming weeks. The budget for the Home Office is set to shrink by 3.3% next year in real terms, with the bulk of this coming from assumed savings on asylum support. At last month's Budget, the government said it planned to \"increase the core government grant for police forces,\" although it did not specify whether this would be in cash terms or taking account of inflation.

    "UK will not pay out over slavery, says Reeves\n\nRachel Reeves echoed comments by the prime minister, saying that there needed to be a focus on the present and not the past\n\nThe UK is \"not going to be paying out\" reparations for the transatlantic slave trade, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC. Her comments come as diplomatic sources told the BBC that the Commonwealth heads of government are preparing to begin a \"meaningful conversation\" about an issue which could potentially mean the UK owing billions of pounds. The chancellor said she understood why Commonwealth leaders would be making such demands, but it was not something the UK government would commit to. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is attending the summit, said he wanted to discuss current challenges, especially climate change, rather than issues of the past.\n\n\"That's where I'm going to put my focus - rather than what will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations,\" he said. \u201cOf course slavery is abhorrent to everybody; the trade and the practice, there's no question about that. But I think from my point of view\u2026 I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work... on the current future-facing challenges.\u201d\n\u2022 None No UK apology over slavery at Commonwealth summit\n\nThe chancellor reiterated that message in an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We\u2019re not going to be paying out the reparations that some countries are speaking about. \"I understand why they make those demands but that\u2019s not something that this government is doing.\" Commonwealth leaders at the Samoa summit are expected to defy the UK and debate ways of securing reparations for historical slavery. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation. Downing Street insists the issue is not on the agenda for the summit of 56 Commonwealth countries. King Charles is in Samoa for a four-day visit and is due to formally open the summit later with a speech paying tribute to his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the role the Commonwealth played in her life. The King will say how \"all nations are equal in this unique and voluntary association\" which \"is committed to developing free and democratic societies\", and will also speak of the \"existential threat\" of climate change and its impact on Commonwealth nations. He will say that the Commonwealth, thanks to its scale and diversity - representing a third of humanity - can \"discuss the most challenging issues with openness and respect\", and also speak to the importance of recognising and understanding the path of history, and where that may have given rise to contemporary challenges.\n\u2022 None What form could reparations for slavery take?\n\nIn the run-up to this year's summit, there have been growing calls from Commonwealth leaders for the UK to apologise and make reparations worth for the country\u2019s historic role in the slave trade. A report published last year by the University of West Indies - backed by Patrick Robinson, a judge who sits on the International Court of Justice - concluded the UK owed more than \u00a318tn in reparations for its role in slavery in 14 Caribbean countries. Frederick Mitchell, foreign minister of the Bahamas, believes the UK could change its stance and he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \u201cOnce you broach the subject it may take a while for people to come around but come around they will.\" Reparatory justice for slavery can come in many forms, including financial reparations, debt relief, an official apology, educational programmes, building museums, economic support, and public health assistance. On a visit to Kenya last year, the King expressed the \"greatest sorrow and regret\" over the \"wrongdoings\" of the colonial era, but stopped short of issuing an apology, which would have required the agreement of ministers.\n\u2022 None King and Queen arrive in Samoa to red carpet welcome\n\nMr Mitchell told the Commonwealth gathering: \"It\u2019s a simple matter \u2013 it can be done, one sentence, one line.\" He said to the BBC: \"The word is apologise, that\u2019s the word.\" Asked how much reparations should amount to, he said it was not just a matter of money but of \u201crespect, acknowledging the past was a wrong that needs to be corrected\u201d. He said member countries \"want the conversation to start\" but \"there appears to be even a reluctance to have the conversation\". Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said: \u201cReparations are not on the agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. The government\u2019s position has not changed \u2013 we do not pay reparations. \"We are focused on using the summit at [the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] to discuss the shared opportunities which we can unlock across the Commonwealth \u2013 including securing more economic growth.\u201d It is understood the Downing Street position \u2013 that reparatory justice is not on the agenda \u2013 while technically correct, has angered some Caribbean ministers when it was obvious the issue would be discussed at the summit.\n\nSome non-Caribbean countries are not unsympathetic towards the British position and want the summit to focus more on existing challenges - such as climate change, which is adversely affecting many Commonwealth countries, about half of whom are small island states. But all three candidates hoping to be elected this weekend as the next secretary general of the Commonwealth - Shirley Botchwey of Ghana, Joshua Setipa of Lesotho and Mamadou Tangara of Gambia - have made clear they support reparatory justice.\n\u2022 None What form could reparations for slavery take?",
    "Billions at stake in court battle over North Sea oil\n\nProtesters from Greenpeace and Uplift gathered outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh at the start of the case\n\nHow much oil - and how much profit - remain beneath the waters that buffet the British Isles? Going by the number of lawyers packed into the Court of Session in Edinburgh this week, it must be a decent amount. Seven advocates squeezed into the front row of courtroom number one where environmental campaigners are challenging the government's approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields. Behind them, a further three rows were also packed with lawyers, tapping on laptops and scribbling in notebooks. Such an army obviously does not come cheap. Remarkably they all agree on one basic fact - the Rosebank oil field in the Atlantic and the Jackdaw gas development in the North Sea were approved unlawfully. However, the lawyers disagree sharply about what, if anything, should be done about it.\n\nThe person who must decide is Andrew Stewart, better known by his judicial title, Lord Ericht, who is presiding over this judicial review of the UK government's decisions to approve the fields. The previous Conservative administration and the oil and gas regulator consented to Jackdaw in summer 2022, with its owner Shell saying the field would be able to provide gas to 1.4 million British homes.\n\nRosebank, located west of Shetland and estimated to contain between 300 and 500 million barrels of oil, was given the green light the following autumn. Operated by Norwegian state energy giant Equinor and Aberdeen-based Ithaca Energy, it is believed to be the largest untapped field in UK waters and its oil is to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland. Among many other requirements, consent was granted on the basis of environmental impact statements submitted by the companies. As was standard practice at the time, these assessed the climate impact of emissions caused by the process of extracting oil and gas but did not assess the impact of the greenhouse gases which would be released when the fossil fuels were eventually burned, known as downstream emissions. Consent in hand, the owners of the fields raced ahead with work to get ready for drilling, striking deals with suppliers and hiring staff. All week the court has heard repeated references to the vast sums of money that are being spent on the two projects.\n\nEquinor says it will invest \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank and provide employment for 4,000 people\n\nCounsel for Equinor said it was investing \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank, providing employment for 4,000 people. Shell's lawyer said it was investing \u00a31.1bn in the Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea, employing \"at least 1,000\" people between 2023 and 2025. Production is scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27. But this June a victory for climate campaigners in the UK Supreme Court sent a shiver through all three firms and the wider industry. In Finch v Surrey County Council, which involved a dispute about drilling oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the court ruled that an environmental impact assessment must include downstream emissions.\n\nOn the eve of the judicial review, Sarah Finch, the environmental campaigner after whom the Surrey case is named, told me that \"the exact same thing happened at Rosebank.\u201d \u201cIt was granted permission with no assessment of the impact of burning the oil or gas to come out of it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo, a much bigger site, but exactly the same argument.\" The three companies involved in the Court of Session accept the Finch ruling means that, in retrospect, their licences were granted unlawfully. However, they insist they provided all the environmental information required at the time of their applications; they were told by the industry regulator not to assess downstream emissions; and they should not be \"punished\" for a Supreme Court decision which they say they could not have foreseen. Lord Ericht appeared to sum up their position succinctly on Friday, when he suggested it amounted to them asking him to say: \"I accept this decision is unlawful but I give it lawful effect.\" The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift strongly object to any such idea. They disagree that the decision in Finch could not have been predicted with one lawyer suggesting the oil companies had simply lost a bet.\n\nBoth groups now want the judge to pause work on Rosebank and Jackdaw while the fields' downstream emissions are assessed. Then, they argue, the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, and the government's North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), could make a fresh decision about the fields\u2019 licences, armed with a fuller understanding of their contribution to climate change. Even then, there may be a snag. Lawyers for the government, who were also in court, say that in certain circumstances they have doubts that Mr Miliband would have the necessary legal power to revisit the decisions at all. If Mr Miliband does have the power, and if it does come to the crunch, it is not clear what he would do. In court, the UK government's lawyer was reluctant to be drawn on the matter. At times he sounded as if ministers very much wished the whole affair would simply go away. After all, in campaigning against the Tories in the general election this summer, Labour had carefully crafted a policy which appeared designed to minimise controversy, and to avoid becoming dragged into the debate about Rosebank. It went like this - Labour was committed to tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also recognised the importance of the oil and gas industry. As such it would not grant any new exploration licences in UK waters but it would allow existing projects - including Rosebank and Jackdaw - to continue. Ministers spoke of domestic energy production as critical for keeping bills down; helping to ensure the nation's energy security; generating taxes; and for assisting with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Many of those claims are contested by environmentalists.\n\nCampaigners hope Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will be able to make a fresh decision on licensing, but he may not have the legal authority to do so\n\nTessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said 80% of the UK's oil was exported. \"There's no world in which you could have a robust environmental assessment that takes into account those downstream emissions and decide that those environmental impacts are acceptable,\" she told me. In Aberdeen though, the heart of the UK's energy industry, there is a great deal of nervousness about the potential impact of the decision in this case, and about the wider impact of government policy on the sector. Just last week, one US oil firm said it would end all North Sea operations by the end of 2029 because of high levels of taxation.\n\nNow, the eyes of climate campaigners, politicians, and oil companies alike are on Lord Ericht. Perhaps he will find a compromise, for example by allowing the oil firms to proceed with preparatory works - as long as they don\u2019t extract any oil and gas - while at the same time requiring them to provide the government with information on downstream emissions to enable them to revisit the decision. The companies\u2019 lawyers bridled at the suggestion that they were in the business of gambling but, in such a case, maybe they would have little choice but to bet that the politics of pulling the plug would be too painful for Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government. Late on Friday afternoon, the judge retired to consider his decision, a process which could take several weeks or even months. Thanking the many lawyers for their \"excellent contributions,\" he concluded the hearing by saying: \"It's a very difficult matter and it's a very important matter,\" adding, \"I shall issue my judgment in due course.\"",
    "Police in Laos have detained eight members of staff at a backpacker hostel following the deaths of six tourists from suspected methanol poisoning last week. According to local media, those detained include workers and management from the Nana Backpacker Hostel in the town of Vang Vieng, where several of the tourists who later died had stayed. It is unclear how many other people were taken ill and an investigation into the deaths is continuing. The owners of the hostel, which is now closed, have previously denied serving illicit alcohol.\n\nIt is not the first time that police have detained staff from the hostel. The manager was among a number of people who were questioned by police last week. He earlier told the Associated Press, external news agency that 19-year-old Australians Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles were the only people staying at the hostel to have become unwell after drinking free shots before heading out for the night. The pair died days later - after being admitted to hospital in neighbouring Thailand. Theirs were the first deaths suspected to be caused by methanol - a toxic, flavourless and colourless substance commonly added to bootleg alcohol. Two Danish women and a 57-year-old American man, who were also staying at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, died at around the same time. The two young Danes - Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, and Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21 - were found unconscious in their hostel bedroom on 13 November. That was the same day that the Australian women were taken to hospital after going out to a bar in the city the night before, local media reported. They were sent to a hospital in the capital Vientiane, but died in the middle of the night. The medical team said the cause of death was sudden heart failure. Also on 13 November, hostel staff noticed that the American tourist - named as James Louis Hutson - had not come out of his room. When they went to check on him, he was found lying dead on the bed, with several empty drinks glasses nearby. There were no bruises or wounds on his body, local media reported.\n\nSimone White, a 28-year-old London lawyer, also died after she was believed to have ingested methanol while staying in Vang Vieng.\n\u2022 None What is methanol and how does it affect the body? The tourists' deaths have cast a spotlight on the popular backpacking town and spooked tourists, especially women, as five of the six who died were female travellers. Governments including New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, have warned their citizens about drinking spirits in Laos. Some travellers in Vang Vieng are steering clear of the once-popular free shots and alcohol buckets offered to tourists, telling the BBC that they felt concerned about their safety. Methanol poisoning is the most prevalent in Asia, mostly affecting poorer communities and places with weak food regulations and enforcement. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on Tuesday that another Australian, a dual national, may also have become ill from methanol poisoning. A New Zealander who had fallen ill from suspected methanol poisoning in the country has now returned home, authorities have confirmed.",

    "UK reveals father and son at heart of Evil Corp hackers\n\nMaksim Yabubets, his father Viktor and brother Artem are accused of running Evil Corp\n\nThe UK, US and Australia have announced sanctions against 16 people authorities accuse of being part of the most wanted cyber crime gang in the world. Russia-based Evil Corp is accused of stealing around $300m in nearly ten years of hacking. The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) says it can now reveal the gang\u2019s notorious leader, Maksim Yakubets, has been supported by his father Viktor Yakubets - something he had denied when interviewed by the BBC in 2021. The information has been released as part of a large, multinational operation to disrupt Evil Corp and another notorious hacking group called LockBit. Known for their mafia-style of operation, Evil Corp has waged a campaign of destructive cyber-attacks worldwide for over a decade. In 2019, Maksim Yakubets was sanctioned and a $5m bounty was put up for his arrest, along with another man called Igor Turashev. Other Russian individuals, including Yakubets' brother Artem, were also named as part of the US sanctions and designations. In 2021 the BBC travelled to Russia to search for and interview members of the gang to get their side of the story. At a former home of Maksim Yakubets we found his father, who gave an impassioned defence of his son while claiming he was personally innocent. But now the NCA says that Yakubets senior was a major part of the cyber-crime group, accusing him of aiding the gang in laundering some of its stolen funds.\n\nMaksim Yakubets lived what's been described as a playboy lifestyle in Moscow\n\nAs well as the Yakubets family members, Maksim's father-in-law was also sanctioned for helping to protect and coordinate the group with his connections to the Russian security services. Western authorities have now officially linked Eduard Benderskiy, a former high-ranking FSB official, to Evil Corp. \"Maksim Yakubets and his Evil Corp gang has for years lived the archetypal Russian hacker playboy lifestyle seemingly untouchable to law enforcement but today\u2019s announcement shows that we are still watching, digging and determined to disrupt them and bring them to justice,\" said Will Lyne, Head of Cyber Intelligence at the NCA.\n\nAnother of those sanctioned is Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, described by the NCA as the younger Yakubets\u2019 right-hand man, and an affiliate of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit. It's the first time that a member of Evil Corp has been linked to another major gang and indicates that hackers are working across groups to carry out attacks. As well as the sanctions, four arrests were made, including two in the UK. In August, the NCA executed a number of search warrants in the south of England and arrested a 46-year-old male who is suspected of being linked to a LockBit affiliate. A 50-year-old female was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences. They too were interviewed and later released under investigation whilst the criminal investigation continues. Both individuals were identified through the analysis and enrichment of data acquired during the course of Operation Cronos - the international police operation that brought down LockBit's internal infrastructure. \u201cThe action announced today has taken place in conjunction with extensive and complex investigations by the NCA into two of the most harmful cybercrime groups of all time,\" said James Babbage, Director General for Threats at the NCA. The NCA said Evil Corp's links to the Russian links to the Russian state had been exposed. \"Today's sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem,\" said foreign secretary David Lammy.",

    "Maori haka in NZ parliament to protest at bill to reinterpret founding treaty\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNew Zealand's parliament was brought to a temporary halt by MPs performing a haka, amid anger over a controversial bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding treaty with M\u0101ori people. Opposition party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional ceremonial group dance after being asked whether her party supported the bill, which faced its first vote on Thursday. Meanwhile, a h\u012bkoi - or peaceful protest march - organised by a M\u0101ori rights group, is continuing to make its way towards the capital, Wellington. Thousands have already joined the nine-day march against the bill, which reached Auckland on Wednesday, having begun in the far north of New Zealand on Monday.\n\nThe country is often considered a leader in indigenous rights, but opponents of the bill fear those same rights are being put at risk by this bill. Act, the political party that introduced the bill, argues there is a need to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which has been fundamental to race relations in New Zealand. The core values of the treaty have, over time, been woven into New Zealand's laws in an effort to redress the wrong done to M\u0101ori during colonisation.\n\nThe protest march against the bill made its way through Auckland on Wednesday\n\nBut Act - a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition - say this has resulted in the country being divided by race, and the bill will allow the treaty to be interpreted more fairly through parliament, rather than the courts. The party's leader, David Seymour, has dismissed opponents as wanting to \"stir up\" fear and division. Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling of much-needed support for many M\u0101ori. The first reading passed on Thursday after a 30-minute break, backed by all parties from the ruling coalition. Maipi-Clarke was suspended from the house. It is unlikely to pass a second reading, as Act's coalition partners have indicated they will not support it. But this has not placated those worried about the bill, and its impact, with the hikoi still making progress along its 1,000km (621-mile) route.\n\nDanielle Moreau (centre) took part in the march as it passed through Auckland with her sons Bobby and Teddy\n\nIn Auckland, it took an estimated 5,000 marchers two hours to cross the harbour bridge. Officials had closed two lanes, the New Zealand Herald reported, external, to allow them to continue along the route. Danielle Moreau, who is M\u0101ori, walked over the Harbour Bridge with her two sons, Bobby and Teddy, and told the BBC she \"was hoping it [the h\u012bkoi] would be big but it was much more epic than I expected\". \"I marched to make the point that Te Tiriti [the Treaty of Waitangi] is very important to our national identity,\" said Winston Pond, who also took part in the march on Wednesday. \"We are a multi-cultural society built on a bicultural base - something that cannot be altered.\"\n\nJuliet Tainui-Hernandez (left), with her partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez (right) and daughter Paloma (centre)\n\nJuliet Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez, from the M\u0101ori tribe Ng\u0101i Tahu, and her Puerto Rican partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, brought their daughter Paloma to the h\u012bkoi. Ms Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez said those who turned out in support did so \"for the respectful and inclusive nation we want Aotearoa [New Zealand] to be for our tamariki mokopuna - our children and grandchildren\". Kiriana O\u2019Connell, who is also M\u0101ori, said that the current treaty principles were already a compromise for her people, and she would not support a \"rewrite\". Under the proposed legislation, the treaty principles that would be defined in law are:\n\u2022 None that the government has a right to govern and that parliament has the full right to make laws\n\u2022 None that the rights of M\u0101ori are respected by the Crown\n\u2022 None that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to equal protection under it. Act leader Seymour - who is also New Zealand's associate justice minister - argues that because the principles have never been properly defined legally, the courts \"have been able to develop principles that have been used to justify actions that are contrary to the principle of equal rights\". He says these include \"ethnic quotas in public institutions\" that go against the spirit of fairness for all New Zealanders. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, however, has called the bill \"divisive\" - despite being part of the same coalition.\n\nAct Party leader David Seymour will become deputy prime minister next year under a role-sharing agreement\n\nMeanwhile, the Waitangi Tribunal, which was set up in 1975 to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, notes the bill \"purposefully excluded any consultation with M\u0101ori, breaching the principle of partnership, the Crown\u2019s good-faith obligations, and the Crown\u2019s duty to actively protect M\u0101ori rights and interests\". It also said that the principles of the bill misinterpreted the Treaty of Waitangi and that this \"caused significant prejudice to M\u0101ori\". The tabling of the Treaty Principles Bill comes following a series of measures introduced by the government that have affected M\u0101ori. They include the closure of the M\u0101ori Health Authority, which was set up under Jacinda Ardern's Labour government to help create health equity, and reprioritising English over M\u0101ori when it comes to the official naming of government organisations, for example. While roughly 18% of New Zealand's population consider themselves to be M\u0101ori, according to the most recent census, many remain disadvantaged compared with the general population when assessed through markers such as health outcomes, household income, education levels and incarceration and mortality rates. There remains a seven-year gap in life expectancy. The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement between the British and many, but not all, M\u0101ori tribes, which was signed in 1840. It is contentious as it was written in both English and M\u0101ori - which had only been a spoken language until colonisation - and the two versions contain fundamental differences when it comes to issues such as sovereignty. While the treaty itself is not enshrined in law, its principles have been adopted over time into various pieces of legislation. The bill will now be sent to a select committee for a six-month public hearing process.",
    "The sprint finish to the start line is on. It is not the sprint finish to the finish line, but the sprint finish to the starting blocks. The next leader of the Conservative Party will be selected by Conservative Party members, but they will only get to choose from the final two candidates picked by Conservative MPs on Wednesday afternoon. Right now, there is: Intrigue, plotting, phone calls, quiet chats, guesswork and claims of underhand tactics. \u201cWe are pushing towards quite the season finale,\u201d one Conservative MP said to me. I know what you might be thinking: pull yourself together, this is a vote to determine the final two candidates to become the Leader of the Opposition next month. It is not exactly the race to the White House. But it is, nonetheless, a crunch moment.\n\nThere are three candidates left - James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch - but just two golden tickets. You can read more about the three still in the running here. The standout development in Tuesday\u2019s round of voting was James Cleverly propelling himself not just into the lead, but being miles in front. He managed 39 votes, a number even some in his own camp acknowledge was a bit higher than they were expecting. His performance is put down to making the most of his conference speech last week and the efficient hoovering up of quite a lot of MPs who had previously backed the former cabinet minister Mel Stride. In a race with 121 votes available in total, if every Conservative MP votes, 41 is sufficient to guarantee a place in the final two, since both rivals cannot outpoll you. (Incidentally, I am told that outgoing leader Rishi Sunak did not vote, meaning there was actually an electorate of 120).\n\nEither way, Cleverly is very nearly there, assuming he does not go backwards. The working assumption of all of the campaigns is that he is going to make the final pair. And so it is now a tussle between Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick for second place. Jenrick came second in this latest round of voting, with 31 votes \u2013 but managed to lose two votes from the previous round. Badenoch came third with 30, just one vote behind, but did gain two votes. And there are now 20 votes looking for a new home after the widely expected elimination of the former security minister Tom Tugendhat. It may not seem like a big number, but 20 is one heck of a lot in an electorate of 121. \u201cJames is an irrelevance now. It\u2019s all now a battle between us and Kemi\u2019s team,\u201d said a Team Jenrick insider. \u201cTom\u2019s supporters are closer to our side than hers,\u201d they added. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ahead in the end.\u201d It is a characteristic blast of confidence from Jenrick\u2019s camp, who have exuded plenty of it throughout. But there is no shortage of psychology in all of this too - and you might need a splash of outward confidence when you have just been knocked off top spot and managed to go backwards.\n\nSupporters of Badenoch acknowledge they would have liked to have seen her do better in the latest round. But they think there is a clump of Tugendhat supporters who really didn't like Jenrick\u2019s claim last week that British special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing terrorists\u201d because of the European Convention on Human Rights. They particularly disliked his use in a campaign video, external of footage of a comrade of Tugendhat\u2019s from his military days, who later died. \u201cRob is in trouble,\u201d one MP predicts \u2013 or hopes. So things are: Uncertain, mighty competitive and close. Tory MPs have to decide who they really do not want to be their leader and weigh up how party members might vote depending on the different potential pairings. The website ConservativeHome reckons, external that as things stand, James Cleverly could beat Robert Jenrick among the members, but Kemi Badenoch could beat James Cleverly. \u201cAccordingly, if MPs want to stop Cleverly from winning, backing Badenoch seems their best. \"And if they want to stop Badenoch, a vote for Jenrick beckons,\" as the ConservativeHome puts it. It is enough to make your head spin. Little wonder rumours are rife that all sorts of jiggery pokery has been going on - and could still be going on. Team Badenoch are playing hardball with an argument about her seeming popularity with party members. But they do so knowing some MPs really do not want her as leader. \u201cWhat will members say if they have to vote for two people they didn\u2019t want?\u201d says one. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like Liz and Rishi all over again, when the members wanted Penny vs Kemi,\u201d they add, in reference to Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt in the contest in 2022 and the prospect of a Cleverly-Jenrick run off. It leaves me pondering how the party would react if Badenoch is rejected by MPs. So, the stakes are high \u2013 as the Conservative Party approaches its biggest single moment yet since its calamitous election defeat in July.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Watch the moment Bianca Williams is taken out of a car and handcuffed by police\n\nTwo former Metropolitan Police officers have been handed their jobs back and will receive back-pay after winning an appeal against their dismissal following their stop and search of two athletes. Met PCs Jonathan Clapham and Sam Franks were fired in October 2023 after their search of the Olympic sprinters Bianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos. The two men won their appeal against a ruling which found they lied by saying they could smell cannabis during the stop and search in west London in July 2020. Mr Dos Santos described the appeal decision as \"disappointing\" and said he and Ms Williams would challenge it in the civil courts.\n\nDuring the incident, the couple were pulled over by the officers and searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons, but nothing was found. The officers had followed Ms Williams and her partner Mr Dos Santos as they drove home from training with their baby, who was then three months old. Mr Clapham and Mr Franks were dismissed after a disciplinary panel found they had lied about smelling cannabis when they pulled over the athletes. Their dismissal was overturned by the Police Appeals Tribunal, which found the panel's decision was \"irrational\" and \"inconsistent\".\n\nBianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos said they would challenge the appeal decision\n\nThe dismissed PCs were \"dedicated, hard-working and much respected officers\" whose reputations had been \"ruined\" by the original findings, Appeals Tribunal chairman Damien Moore said. \"Both officers did not lie. Both officers will now be reinstated to the Met Police. They should receive back-pay,\" he said. \"Being a police officer in London brings about its own set of unique challenges,\" Mr Moore added. He wished Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos \"all good fortune\". Hugh Davies, representing Mr Clapham, said the officers had \"every reason to suspect criminality\" when they pulled Dos Santos over. Mr Davies said another officer at the scene had smelled cannabis, but was not found to have lied.\n\nIn response to the appeal ruling, Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jon Savell said: \u201cWe know this has been an overly lengthy and horrendous process for PC Clapham and PC Franks, as well as their families and colleagues.\" He added that the case had been \"hard on all involved\" and re-emphasised a previous apology from the force to Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos over the stop and search. \"Ultimately, the evidence has shown that the stop and search and the actions of the officers did not amount to misconduct,\" Mr Savell said. \"However, stop and search is most effective when used with the trust and confidence of Londoners.\" He added the new \"stop-and-search charter\" would help rebuild trust.\n\nIn a statement following the tribunal decision, Mr Dos Santos maintained that the \"actions and allegations\" by the officers had been \"completely unacceptable\". \"Our drive home from training in 2020, with our baby, should never have turned into a violent incident where we were wrongly accused of smelling of drugs,\" he said. \"We are professional athletes; we pride ourselves on not doing drugs.\" He added: \"We shall challenge today's outcome in the civil courts. Jules Carey, of the law firm Bindmans, which represents the couple, said the complaints system had \"failed again\" and it \"will be for the civil courts to address this result\".\n\nRick Prior, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the officers had been \"fully exonerated and their reputations have rightly been restored\". \"Justice has been served. Why it ever got to this point, however, remains an absolute mystery,\" he said. Mr Prior said the reinstatements were \"yet another damning indictment\" of the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which referred the officers to the misconduct tribunal. \"Our colleagues have been dragged through hell and back for four years, for doing nothing more or less than the job the public of London expect us to do,\" he added. An IOPC spokesperson said: \"We note the outcome today of the officers' appeal and await the written decision by the Police Appeals Tribunal.\"\n\nMs Williams won silver at the Paris Olympics as part of the relay team\n\nMs Williams had alleged that racial profiling played a factor in the officers' conduct, but this was not upheld in the original misconduct tribunal. At the Paris Olympics this summer, she competed as part of the women's 4x100m quartet that qualified for the final and went on to win a silver medal.",
    "Surgeon operated with penknife he uses to cut up lunch\n\nPolice are looking into at least 105 cases of alleged medical negligence at the NHS trust\n\nA surgeon at a crisis-hit NHS trust used a Swiss Army penknife to open up the chest of a patient because he claimed he could not find a sterile scalpel. University Hospitals Sussex has said the operation was an emergency, but the surgeon\u2019s actions were \u201coutside normal procedures and should not have been necessary\u201d. Prof Graeme Poston, an expert witness on clinical negligence and a former consultant surgeon, told the BBC: \u201cIt surprises me and appals me. Firstly, a penknife is not sterile. Secondly it is not an operating instrument. And thirdly all the kit [must have been] there.\" Police are separately looking into at least 105 cases of alleged medical negligence at the trust and considering gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges.\n\nThe surgeon in the penknife case, who the BBC is not naming, was operating on a patient at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton when he struggled to find a scalpel. Instead he used a Swiss Army knife which he normally used to cut fruit for his lunch. The patient survived but internal documents show the surgeon\u2019s colleagues felt his behaviour was \u201cquestionable\u201d and were \u201cvery surprised\u201d he was unable to find a scalpel. The BBC has also discovered the same surgeon carried out three supposedly low-risk operations in two months where all three patients died soon after.\n\nThe BBC has previously reported that:\n\u2022 None Four whistleblowers said patients had died unnecessarily and been \u201ceffectively maimed\u201d at the trust\n\u2022 None A former surgeon claimed a \u201cgang culture\u201d existed in the neurosurgery department. The same doctor alleged one surgeon had disproportionate deaths and a second did complex operations without adequate training\n\u2022 None An internal review conceded doctors could have saved the life of student Melissa Zoglie had they acted sooner\n\u2022 None Sussex Police has recruited extra staff as part of its manslaughter probe concerning the trust\n\u2022 None A Royal College of Surgeons review found a \u201cculture of fear\u201d at the trust and suggested senior managers may need to be replaced\n\u2022 None The trust lost a nine-month legal battle with the BBC and The Times to block access to and redact documents in two employment tribunal cases\n\nThe trust launched a series of internal investigations into the three patients who died - and concluded that they had experienced \u201cpoor care\u201d. It also conceded one woman who died \u201cwould have survived if there were no post-operative complications\u201d. The woman\u2019s daughter, who asked not to be identified, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand how mum died. No one seemed to know why the operation was not successful. \u201cThere needs to be a thorough investigation into these deaths, not just an action plan. That\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nPolice say the trust is cooperating fully with the investigation\n\nHealth watchdog the Care Quality Commission looked at the deaths and concluded there had been no breach of regulations. University Hospitals Sussex said: \u201cOur investigations did not raise concerns about the surgeries themselves but did identify common themes for improvement, which we acted on immediately to ensure our services are as safe as possible. \u201cThese included better communication with patients before and after surgery, improved training for end-of-life care, and strengthened processes especially when care is transferred from one site to another.\u201d Prof Poston said these operations usually had a 1% chance of ending in death. After reviewing the surgeon\u2019s employment record, which included a long wait to become a consultant, Prof Poston said: \"I do not know this individual, but you would be concerned that there were problems during the course of that training and progression through training.\u201d\n\nShortly before the deaths, the operations had temporarily been moved to Worthing Hospital from a bigger site in nearby Brighton against some clinical advice. Trust chief executive George Findlay was told by colleagues they had safety concerns about moving the location of the operations. The trust\u2019s position did not change. University Hospitals Sussex said the decision to move the surgeries had included \u201ca thorough process\u2026 with oversight from the executive team\u201d. In response to the wider police investigation of the trust, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of concerning reports currently under investigation by Sussex Police and our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones. \u201cIt is vital police officers are given the space and support to properly investigate these matters. \"Sussex Police has confirmed University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust is cooperating fully with this investigation.\u201d\n\nDr Findlay said: \u201cI want to reassure all of our patients and staff that in each of the cases outlined in this report, thorough investigations took place, and action was taken whenever necessary to ensure lessons were learnt. \u201cWe were in touch with these families to express our sincere sympathies for their loss. \u201cIf we ever fall short of the standards people have a right to expect, then we are open, honest, and move swiftly to make improvements.\" He said the trust faced a number of long-standing challenges, and its teams were working hard to address them. \u201cI am proud of the progress they have made and they will be supported to make the further improvements we know are necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?",
    "Trudeau says the cuts to Canada's immigration targets will pause population growth over the next two years\n\nCanada has announced a sharp cut in the number of immigrants it allows into the country in an effort to \"pause population growth\", marking a notable shift in policy for the Justin Trudeau government. As part of the changes, Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents in 2025 from a previous target of 500,000 to 395,000 - a 21% drop. Prime Minister Trudeau said his government \"didn't get the balance quite right\" when it bolstered immigration post-pandemic to address labour shortages. Public support for immigration in Canada has been waning, with opinion polls suggesting rising concern over the growing numbers and its impact on housing and social services.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of already announced reduced targets for both international students and temporary foreign workers. On Thursday, Trudeau and Canada's immigration minister Marc Miller announced further cuts, this time to the number of new permanent residents. The goal, Miller said, is to set a smaller target of 365,000 new permanent residents by 2027. This reduction will pause population growth in Canada over the next two years, Trudeau said, giving provinces time to catch up on bolstering their healthcare programmes and housing stock. The prime minister said that \"Canadians are justifiably proud\" of their welcoming immigration system, which he said had helped bolster the country's economy and build diverse communities. \u201cOur immigration system has always been responsible and it has always been flexible,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe are acting today because of the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn\u2019t get the balance quite right.\u201d The vast majority of Canada\u2019s population growth last year - about 97% - was driven by immigration, according to federal data. At the same time, Canada\u2019s unemployment rate has increased to 6.5% and stands at over 14% for young people. The move marks a departure from decades of open immigration policies in Canada, which has relied on newcomers to meet population targets and to fill labour gaps. Since Trudeau was elected in 2015, his government has raised annual permanent resident targets from 272,000 to 485,000 this year. The biggest jump was seen in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic. Trudeau and his government have been criticised for increasing immigration without bolstering services or housing construction, and economists have warned that Canada's rapidly growing population has put a strain on housing and public services like healthcare. Earlier this month, a poll by the Environics Institute, which has tracked Canadians' attitudes towards immigration since 1977, revealed that 58% of Canadians now feel that immigration levels were too high. The institute said the findings suggest that public opinion on immigration levels has \"effectively flipped from being acceptable (if not valuable) to problematic\". The cuts to immigration targets have been criticised by advocacy groups like the Migrant Rights Network, who wrote in an open letter to Trudeau and Miller that migrants are being unfairly blamed for Canada's affordability crisis. \"Migrants are not responsible for Canada\u2019s housing crisis, lack of jobs, or inadequate healthcare or other public services,\" they said. The group added that these issues are rather a result of \"decades of federal and provincial policies that have underfunded and privatized public services\".",

In a statement, police said they discovered Payne's body after an emergency crew responded to an call in the upscale neighbourhood of Palermo on Wednesday. On Thursday, police in Buenos Aires said a preliminary autopsy suggests Liam Payne died from external and internal bleeding injuries. The police inspected the area where Payne fell, and found items including alcohol and a phone. Medication was found in his room. Payne had risen to global fame as part of the much-loved boyband created on the X Factor TV show in 2010, along with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik.\n\nAccording to police in Buenos Aires, officers at the scene were initially responding to reports \"of an aggressive man who may have been under the effects of drugs and alcohol\". When they arrived at the hotel, officials were told a loud sound had been heard in an interior courtyard. Soon after, they discovered the body there. A police investigation was then launched. Emergency medical services director Alberto Crescenti told local media that Payne had suffered \"serious injuries\" and that an autopsy will be carried out. Mr Crescenti declined to answer questions about the circumstances of Payne's fall from the balcony. The star's body has been transferred to a morgue in the city.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer (UK only)\n\nPolice in Buenos Aires confirmed on Thursday that an inspection of the scene where Payne fell has been carried out on the hotel\u2019s ground floor. They said that a bottle of whiskey, a lighter, and a mobile phone were found. Police said \"everything indicates that the musician was alone when the fall happened\", and that he had died at the scene and there were no injuries that suggested a third party had been involved. In the hotel room where Payne was staying, staff found \u201ctotal disorder\u201d including \u201cvarious items broken.\u201d They said this included several packets of medication, including Clonazepam, external, as well as over-the-counter medications. A notebook and passport were also found at the scene.\n\nEvidence and finger prints have been collected and the room\u2019s balcony has also been inspected to establish access to it. Five witness statements were taken by the police on the night, three from hotel employees and two from women who had been in the room with Payne earlier on, but were not there at the time of the fall. Payne posted on Snapchat just hours before the incident, saying: \"It's a lovely day here in Argentina\" but the video was from earlier in the week where he had spent time with his girlfriend Kate Cassidy.\n\u2022 None Boy band star who had the X factor\n\u2022 None The former One Direction star's life in pictures\n\nThe UK Foreign Office confirmed it was in touch with authorities in Argentina \"regarding reports of the death of a British man\". No further details were given. Once news of his death broke, fans began gathering outside the Buenos Aires hotel where the death took place, prompting police to cordon off the entrance. Some lit candles in his memory. \"I was in my living room and my sister told me Liam died,\" a young fan named Violeta Antier told Reuters news agency. \"We couldn't believe it. We came here directly to confirm it was true.\" Ms Antier said she saw Payne at the Niall Horan concert just two weeks ago. Another woman cried as she explained why she had come to the hotel, telling Reuters in Spanish: \"This is the only way I have to say goodbye to him\". One Direction had global success with hits such as What Makes You Beautiful and Story of My Life, while Payne also enjoyed some solo success after the band announced in 2015 that they were going on hiatus the following year.\n\nFans gathered outside the Buenos Aires hotel where Liam Payne was found dead\n\nIn August this year, Payne was announced as a judge on a new Netflix talent show alongside former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland and The Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger. Payne, who was born in Wolverhampton in the UK, first tried for stardom when he auditioned for ITV talent show The X Factor in 2008 \u2013 but judge Simon Cowell told him to \"come back in two years\". He did, impressing the judges more in 2010, and was put together with four other solo hopefuls at the boot camp stage and One Direction were born. The group had four UK number one albums and four number one singles as well as topping charts around the world, before Zayn Malik left in 2015, prompting the band's hiatus. In 2017, Payne's debut solo single Strip That Down, which peaked at number three on the Official UK Chart, and his collaboration with Rita Ora on the song For You - from the Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack \u2013 also reached the top 10. He began a relationship with Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy in 2016 and they had a son, Bear, the following year. The couple split in 2018. The BBC has seen a cease and desist letter against the singer earlier this week from another of Payne's former partners, Maya Henry. She had posted on social media accusing him of repeatedly contacting her. Payne did not respond to the accusations.",

Crash that killed four teens was avoidable, inquest hears\n\nA crash that killed four teenage boys when they drowned in an overturned car could have been avoided, an inquest has heard. Hugo Morris, 18, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Jevon Hirst, 16, all from Shrewsbury, died when their car left a rural road while they were on a camping trip last November. It flipped on to its roof in a flooded ditch, leaving the four A-level students trapped. A conclusion of road traffic collision was recorded by the senior coroner for North West Wales.\n\nThe teenagers had been visiting Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, when they set off from Harlech on 19 November to spend the night camping. But the Ford Fiesta being driven by Hugo left the A4085 road near the villages of Garreg and Llanfrothen. The crashed car could not be seen from the road and led to a massive two day search to find the boys. The inquest was told that a passing refuse recycling truck spotted the upturned car while on its round on the Tuesday morning.\n\nAll four students were found dead in the car. The inquest was told that post-mortem examinations revealed none of them had any internal or external injuries, and had died as a result of drowning. Giving evidence to the hearing, crash investigators for North Wales Police said there were \"no catastrophic mechanical failures\" with the car. However, both rear tyres were only half the required inflated pressure for carrying four people.\n\nMr Thompson said, in his view, Hugo had driven into a bend on the road too fast, causing the vehicle to come off the road. He said he calculated the maximum theoretical speed around the bend was 38mph. But he added: \"Having driven the bend myself the fastest speed I felt comfortable negotiating the bend was 26mph.\" He said the Ford Fiesta had entered that bend at a speed that was in excess of the limit to negotiate it, even though that may well have been below the road's 60mph limit. Mr Thompson said the actions of Hugo Morris needed to be considered in the accident. While it had been raining heavily, with leaf cover on the road, the investigator said he did not consider weather conditions played a role in the collision. But he said in his view, the crash \"was avoidable\".\n\nDelivering her conclusion, senior coroner Kate Robertson noted that there had been inadequate signage on the approach to the bend. She said she will also be writing to Cyngor Gwynedd and the landowner by the crash site about the need for fencing or barriers at the location. The coroner will also write to the UK government, raising her own concerns over newly qualified drivers being able to carry passengers. \"Having considered and heard the evidence I do have a concern,\" she said.\n\u2022 None A town in mourning for boys 'so full of promise'\n\nTributes were read out to all the boys by the coroner. Harvey's mother Crystal said he was \"perfect from the minute he came into the world and continued to be until he was tragically taken from us\". \"Harvey had the biggest, warmest smile that radiated love and calmness and a contagious positive energy,\" she said.\n\nHarvey Owen \"always had a soft spot for people who he knew were struggling to fit in or felt they were having a bad time,\" said his mother Crystal\n\nShe said \"every parent's worst nightmare came true\" last November and Harvey's family now faced \"a lifetime of grieving the life he should be living, the time we should have had with him and the memories we should be creating\".\n\nHeather Sanderson, Wilf's mother, said she was \"very proud\" of her son, who was \"so kind and had a lovely sense of humour\". \"I will miss him for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe car carrying the four teens came off the A4085\n\nIn a statement the mother of Jevon said he was \"happiest when he was at home with his family\". \"He was really close to his family and was loved,\" said Melanie Hirst.\n\nThe parents of Hugo said their son had a \"thirst for life\". \"No words can express our loss,\" said Dominic and Sarah Morris. \"Our world is shattered, bent and cracked. He is impossible to forget.\"\n\nHarvey's mother, Ms Owen, said the death of her son and his friends has led to her launching a campaign to change the law for younger drivers. She has started an online petition calling for the introduction of a graduated driving licence. It would require new learners to have at least six months training before being able to apply for a test. It would also ban newly-qualified drivers from carrying passengers under the age of 25 for the first six months, without an older adult present. Speaking outside the coroner's court, Ms Owen said she was \"very happy\" with the outcome but the government still needed to act. She said: \"My son was able to get in the back of a car driven by a young, inexperienced driver and be driven on an unfamiliar rural road without my knowledge. He was let down by an outdated driving licence system.\"",

    "Striking Boeing workers are set to vote on a new offer from the aviation giant, which includes a 38% pay rise over the next four years. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union, which represents more than 30,000 striking workers, has endorsed the offer and says it will hold a ballot of its members on Monday. The walkout started on 13 September, leading to a dramatic slowdown in production and deepening a crisis at the firm. The union had previously called for a 40% pay increase and workers have rejected two previous offers, including the last offer of a 35% rise.\n\nAs well as the proposed pay rise, the latest offer includes a $12,000 (\u00a39,300) bonus for the workers if a deal is reached, up from $7,000. \"It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,\" an IAM social media post said. \"We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success.\" Boeing said the offer would see average annual pay rise to $119,309 over the next four years. \"We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4,\" Boeing said in a statement. The new offer also includes changes to workers' retirement plans.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2.7% in extended trading in New York after the proposed deal was announced.

Last week, its commercial aircraft business reported operating losses of $4bn for the three months to the end of September. The company also launched a share sale to raise more than $20bn earlier this week. It came after warnings that a prolonged strike could lead to downgrades to Boeing's credit rating, which would make it more expensive for it to borrow money. The firm is also moving ahead with plans to lay off around 17,000 workers, with the first redundancy notices expected to be issued in mid-November. The latest crisis at Boeing erupted in January with a dramatic mid-air blowout of a piece of one of its passenger planes. Its space business also suffered a reputational hit after its Starliner vessel was forced to return to Earth without carrying astronauts.",
    "It has been a matter of 'when' not 'if' Joe Root would beat Sir Alastair Cook's England Test run-scoring record. This air of inevitability has been looming for the past 10 years and finally, with a century in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan, he cruised past with plenty left in the tank. I first bowled properly at Joe Root at the old stadium in Ahmedabad in 2012, before the massive Narendra Modi Stadium was built. He was a 21-year-old on his first England tour and I had been in the England side for more than two years. This was the famous series when we beat India 2-1 - the last time they lost at home. I had torn my quad on the first day of a warm-up game in Mumbai and was making my way back to fitness, building up my workload in the nets. The recovery was going well. I was just about up to full pace and decided to pick a ball that would reverse swing as a confidence booster, to take a few wickets and get the bounce in my run-up going. I always felt as though I attacked the crease and committed to the motion of bowling much better when the ball was reversing. I would predominantly swing the ball away from right-handers when the ball was reverse-swinging, to drag them and their head across their crease and to threaten the outside edge, then bowl an effort-ball inswinger when the batter was least expecting it. At the time I was capable of bowling upwards of 90mph and could rush some of the best players in the world. I was dragging Root across the crease, moving his head outside off stump and then tried my first inswinger. He played it with perfect balance, eyes level, under his nose to mid-on as though he had telepathically read what I was trying to do. For such a young player, he just felt different.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWe continued this battle for the rest of the net. I would try to hide the ball, switching it in my hand as I was loading up. I may have even tried marginally over-stepping to try to beat him for pace. It didn't matter. He played me serenely for the rest of the net. This isn't to say playing me bowling well is a litmus test for being a good batter, far from it. But, from a bowler's point of view, you get a real sense of how good a batter is when you're bowling at them in the nets. It is a tight, enclosed space. More balls are bowled in a shorter space of time than during a game. It can be intense. A bowler gets an inclination of when a batter is a good player and Root certainly stood out from any other young batter I had bowled to at the time. Root arrived into a successful team. We won the Ashes in Australia and had been ranked number one in the world. There were some big names in there: Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Matt Prior. He was not overawed. Instead, he was immediately cheeky. The Joe Root grin we have seen so often throughout the past 12 years was there every day of his first tour. He played pranks and got stuck into the environment as though he was someone who was going to be in that dressing room for a long time. The only time that smile evaded him was towards the end of his captaincy tenure. Thankfully it returned straight after.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA sign of how good a person Root is, is how he settled back into the ranks once his great mate Ben Stokes took over the captaincy. Even though it was clear he wanted to carry on as skipper after the West Indies series of 2022, Root doubled down on the style of play Stokes wanted. The message that sent to the dressing room would have been huge and one of the reasons the changeover of captaincy was so seamless. Root has always had an ability to adapt and evolve. He is never satisfied and never stands still. For everything which comes naturally to him, like the straight-bat punch off the back foot through backward point, there are other things he has had to work at in order to survive and excel, especially in foreign conditions: rotating the strike from spin off both front and back foot, becoming so selective about how and when he plays his sweeps (not to be confused with reverse scoops). It is not a stretch to say he is renowned as the best batter in the world in sub-continental conditions for visiting teams from outside Asia. Root has an insatiable hunger for runs. When he gets an opportunity to go big, he will rarely throw it away. He had troubles early in his career converting fifties to hundreds. Those experiences have made him realise the opportunity to score centuries doesn't just grow on trees. You can see the concentration and determination in his eyes when he is not willing to leave any runs out there. In his first 97 Tests he scored 17 hundreds and 49 fifties. In the 49 Tests up to this series he scored 17 hundreds and 15 fifties. A quite remarkable conversion rate. The next statistical aim for Root is Sachin Tendulkar's all-time Test run-scoring record of 15,921. Root is only 33 and at his current rate of scoring it would take him 38 Tests to overhaul 'The Little Master'. It is not inconceivable this feat could be completed within three years. Root has been bullish about not being close to satisfied at merely surpassing Cook, and that he has many more Test runs in his sights. It is a comforting thought for England fans. Psychologically, he may consider a stack of runs in a successful away Ashes series win as the prize to top off a magnificent career. In Australia, Root averages 35.68 with no hundreds. He has played in some horror shows of series down under and might be grateful to catch Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins well into their 30s next winter. England's greatest ever batter has two more peaks to conquer. He isn't done yet.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "P&O owner to attend summit despite row over minister's comments\n\nP&O Ferries owner, DP World, will now attend the UK's investment summit on Monday, despite a row over a minister's criticism of the firm. It had been feared they might pull out from the summit - where they were expected to announce a \u00a31bn investment - after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh criticised the ferry firm and urged consumers to boycott the company. An expansion of the firm's London Gateway port, in Essex, is likely to go ahead, with an announcement expected by some in the coming days. Whitehall sources said on Saturday that there had been \"warm engagement\" between senior figures in the firm and the government since Sir Keir Starmer distanced himself from his minister's remarks.\n\nThe government is hosting the International Investment Summit, where it hopes to attract billions of pounds of investment. A Downing Street spokesperson said the summit would \"show Britain is open for business\" as it looks to enable economic growth. Later, a government source said the prime minister had confidence in Haigh. A government spokesperson said: \"DP World\u2019s investment in Britain is a vote of confidence in the stability and seriousness of the government. We welcome the jobs and opportunities it will create.\" They added that the government was unlocking the UK's \"potential and ambition\" by working in partnership with businesses and investors around the world. DP World has said the expansion of the London Gateway port would bring Thurrock hundreds of jobs. The United Arab Emirates-based company also owns the container port in Southampton. It has yet to comment publicly on the latest developments. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast on Friday, Sir Keir said Haigh's comments were \"not the view of the government\". The prime minister is understood not to have been directly involved in talks with DP World, nor has he personally spoken to Haigh about her remarks.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. P&O criticism 'not view of the government', says Starmer\n\nThe row started after Haigh described P&O as a \"rogue operator\" in an interview with ITV on Wednesday, after it sacked nearly 800 seafarers in 2022 and replaced them with cheaper workers. Asked whether she used the ferry service, she said: \"I've been boycotting P&O Ferries for two-and-a-half years and I would encourage consumers to do the same.\" DP World insisted the move was needed for the survival of the ferry operator and to secure thousands of jobs. Haigh's comments in the interview coincided with the Department for Transport announcing new legislation aimed at protecting seafarers' jobs from so-called \"fire and rehire\" practices of \"rogue employers\". In that announcement, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner was quoted calling P&O Ferries' prior actions \"outrageous\". But senior government figures have since told the BBC that they were incensed by the specific suggestion that consumers boycott the ferry firm. Haigh's comments also attracted criticism from the Conservatives, with shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake arguing Labour \"don't understand business\". However, the Labour chair of the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, defended Haigh. She had been \"absolutely right to say that the behaviour of P&O, owned by DP World, in the past has been completely unacceptable\", he said. The row has exposed a tension between the new government's desire to attract business and strengthen workers' rights.",
    "Standing on a podium in a Florida convention centre on the night of the election, a row of American flags behind him and a jubilant crowd looking on, Donald Trump declared: \u201cMany people have told me that God spared my life for a reason, and that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\u201d\n\nThis was one of the most striking themes of his election campaign - that he had been chosen by God.

Additionally, a number of rail services were cancelled from the new Grand Central Station due to \"operational reasons\". In a post on X, formerly Twitter, the transport operator said some bus services in and out of the city centre are experiencing delays of approximately 35 minutes. \"Apologies for any delay and inconvenience,\" it said. The transport provider also issued warnings to commuters on Thursday evening as a result of heavy traffic in and out of Belfast city centre.\n\nDigital signage informed commuters that some services have been delayed or cancelled due to roadworks\n\nOn the rail network, the 18:04 BST Portadown to Belfast Grand Central service was cancelled. Translink said the 18:43 Belfast Grand Central to Lisburn service was also cancelled. A number of other trains, including the Enterprise service between Belfast and Dublin, and the Bangor to Belfast line, faced delays. \"Due to operational reasons, we have disruption to train services this evening,\" Translink posted on X, adding a further apology for the inconvenience.

It said that on Thursday afternoon, there were a number of collisions across the city, including an eight-vehicle crash on the M1 southbound between Broadway and Stockmans Lane. This brought traffic to a standstill. The DfI said the crash resulted in long delays back long the M1 and Westlink and onto the M3 and M2. \"The recovery operation took quite some time and again traffic was brought to a standstill at peak rush hour,\" the DfI said. During this recovery operation, another collision happened on the M3's Lagan Bridge east-bound. This caused delays for traffic approaching from the Westlink and M2. \"Both incidents occurred during the peak rush hour period and the time required to ensure that emergency services could attend, and the vehicles could be recovered also had a knock-on effect on some public transport services,\" the DfI said. The Department said it understands that traffic delays are \"frustrating\" and urged commuters to consider using public transport.\n\nOn Friday, Hospitality Ulster and Retail NI called for a return of a pre-Christmas moratorium on city centre roadworks. In a joint statement, the two organisations said the call \"comes admist further traffic congestion in the city... causing major disruption\". The organisations' chief executives have written to the DfI to seek a meeting with Minister for Infrastructure John O'Dowd to discuss the possible move. Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster and Glyn Roberts from Retail NI said: \"For weeks now we have seen bad traffic congestion in the city centre associated with the roadworks, but as seen yesterday, one accident can turn bad congestion into a complete standstill.\" \"If traffic and public transport congestion continues as is and worsens the closer, we get to Christmas, people simply won't come to the city centre.\"\n\nInfrastructure Minister John O\u2019Dowd earlier this week urged people to use public transport\n\nEarlier this week, John O\u2019Dowd, who oversees bus and rail services in Northern Ireland, urged commuters to consider public transport, instead of driving. A year-long closure of Durham Street, a busy road in central Belfast, has led to fears of more congestion in the city. O'Dowd had hoped the start of rail services on Sunday from the new Grand Central Station in the city would encourage more people to use public transport. However, the redevelopment of the area surrounding the new station is blamed by many drivers for causing the traffic problems in the first place.",
    "BBC presenter Paddy McGuinness will start his ultra-endurance challenge later\n\nTV presenter Paddy McGuinness has said Sir Chris Hoy pushed him to his \"absolute limits\" when they trained together ahead of his ultra-endurance cycling challenge for BBC Children in Need. McGuinness, 51, is set to ride nearly 300 miles (483km) when he sets off from Wrexham in Wales later, before aiming to arrive at the finish line on Friday in Glasgow, Scotland. \"Chris Hoy has been absolutely, as you can imagine with someone like him, outstanding, first class, brilliant with his advice,\" McGuinness said. \"When I go on a bike ride with Chris, I really know about it, because he pushes me to my absolute limits,\" he added.\n\nPaddy McGuinness said Sir Chris Hoy had been \"brilliant with his advice\"\n\nMcGuinness, who hosts a Sunday morning show on BBC Radio 2, will cycle through three nations and eight counties on a modified Raleigh Chopper bike.

    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nThe father of 10-year-old Sara Sharif called police from Pakistan and admitted he killed her at their Surrey home, a court heard. Urfan Sharif made the confession in an eight minute-call about an hour after his family\u2019s flight had landed in Islamabad on 10 August last year, before Sara's body was found. Mr Sharif, 42, Sara's stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and her uncle Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murdering the girl at the Old Bailey. Jurors were told Mr Sharif's case was that Ms Batool was responsible for Sara's death and his confession on the phone call and also in a note was false to protect her.\n\nProsecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC told the court Sara had been the victim of violent assaults for \u201cweeks and weeks, at least\u201d, before he listed a series of injuries she had suffered. He said Sara had external and internal injuries, including extensive bruising, burns and broken bones, old and new. She had burns to her buttocks, caused by a domestic iron, and six \u201cprobable human bite marks\u201d to her arms and legs, the prosecution said. Dental impressions ruled out that the bite marks had been caused by the male defendants, but Ms Batool had refused to provide the impressions, the court heard. Sara also suffered injuries to her ribs, shoulder blades, fingers and 11 separate fractures to her spine, as well as signs of a traumatic brain injury, the prosecution added.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nMr Sharif called Surrey Police from Pakistan where the family had fled before her body was found and told the operator that he killed his daughter. The prosecutor said that in the call, which lasted eight minutes and 34 seconds, Mr Sharif told the operator that he \u201clegally punished her\u201d and she died. Later in the call to police, Sara\u2019s father was said to have told the operator that Sara had been naughty and that he then beat her up, jurors heard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much\u201d, the prosecutor said Mr Sharif went on to tell the operator.\n\nHowever, Mr Emlyn Jones KC added: \u201cSara had not just been beaten up. Her treatment, certainly in the last few weeks of her life, had been appalling and brutal.\u201d The court also heard that next to Sara\u2019s body was a note in Urfan Sharif\u2019s handwriting. Mr Emlyn Jones KC said it read: \u201cWhoever see this note it\u2019s me Urfan Sharif who killed my daughter by beating. I am running away because I am scared but I promise I will hand over myself and take punishment. \u201cI swear to God that my intention was not to kill her but I lost it.\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC added: \u201cAs in the 999 call, on the face of it, the note appears to be a confession to having caused Sara\u2019s death by beating her up.\u201d\n\nJurors also heard that police found Sara\u2019s body on a bottom bunkbed under covers as if she was asleep. \u201cBut she was not asleep, she was dead,\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC told the jury. The three defendants, who lived with Sara before her death in August last year, are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they deny. Mr Emlyn Jones KC added that each defendant was seeking to \u201cdeflect the blame\u201d onto one or both of the others. The prosecution said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that any of the adults could have carried out the abuse \u201cwithout the complicity, participation, assistance and encouragement of the others\u201d. \u201cNone of them ever reported Sara\u2019s abuse to any outside agency, who could have intervened,\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC added.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "Joe Freeman with James and Arthur Dunley, who all took part in the contest\n\nThey came in their flat caps, waistcoats and with an ice-cool stare - all hoping to be crowned the best lookalike of Peaky Blinders' Tommy Shelby. The contest took place on Saturday in Birmingham city centre and follows the craze of celebrity doppelganger competitions currently sweeping the globe. Over 100 spectators gathered outside the Bullring to watch participants step forward with their best impression of Cillian Murphy's character. Based on levels of applause and a judges' opinions, 66-year-old Derek Brennan was named the winner.\n\nDerek Brennan said he thought he'd be too old to be crowned the winner\n\n\"My looks and my personality won me the competition, I can't help but be the best,\" Mr Brennan joked. Speaking to the BBC, he said he thought of himself as too old to be called a lookalike but friends had always said he resembled the hero of Steven Knight's hit series. \"People would tell me I look like him [Cillian Murphy] but I always thought I'd be too old so I joke and say I could be his dad.\"\n\nStudent Joe Freeman braved the rain and donned a suit after hearing about the contest on Instagram. He was so committed he got his hair cut the day before. \"I really love the Peaky Blinders and my auntie who is American always says I look like Thomas Shelby - I was going all out and here to win.\"\n\nA prize of a \u00a3500 shopping spree was up for grabs\n\nJames Dunley, 22, and his dad Arthur travelled from Telford, Shropshire, to take part. James said being amongst fans made the event exciting. \"I'm Irish so I share that connection with Cillian and I'm told that I have similar features as him as well,\" he said. \"I'm more here for the fans, the excitement and just meeting everybody. \"I became a huge fan of the show after people kept telling me I looked like Tommy.\" The series, which ran from 2013 to 2022, followed the escapades of a Birmingham crime gang in the years after World War One.

    "No one can doubt Israel\u2019s determination to defend its people, helped enormously by the might of the United States. It is clear though, that the war has shown that nobody can fool themselves that Palestinians will accept lives lived forever under an Israeli military occupation, without proper civil rights, freedom of movement and independence.\n\nAfter generations of conflict Israelis and Palestinians are used to confronting each other. But they are also used to living alongside each other, however uncomfortably. When a ceasefire comes, and with a new generation of leaders, there will be chances to push again for peace.\n\nBut that is a more distant future. The rest of the year and into 2025, with a new president in the White House, are uncertain and full of danger.\n\nFor months after Hamas attacked Israel, the fear was that the war would spread, and get worse. Slowly, and then very quickly, it happened, after Israel\u2019s devastating attacks on Hezbollah and Lebanon.\n\nIt is too late to say the Middle East is on the brink. Israel is facing off against Iran. The warring parties have plunged over it, and countries not yet directly involved are desperate not to be dragged over the edge.\n\nAs I write Israel has still not retaliated for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. It has indicated that it intends to inflict a severe punishment. President Biden and his administration, Israel\u2019s constant supplier of weapons and diplomatic support, are trying to calibrate a response that might offer Iran a way to stop the accelerating climb up the ladder of escalation, a phrase strategists use to describe the way wars speed from crisis to disaster.\n\nThe proximity of the US elections, along with Joe Biden\u2019s steadfast support for Israel, despite his misgivings about the way it has been fighting, do not induce much optimism that the US will somehow finesse a way out.\n\nThe signals from Israel indicate that Netanyahu, Gallant, the generals of the IDF and the intelligence agencies believe they have the upper hand. October 7th was a disaster for them. All the major security and military chiefs, except the prime minister, apologised and some resigned. They had not planned for a war with Hamas. But planning for the war with Hezbollah started after the last one ended in 2006 in a humiliating stalemate for Israel. Hezbollah has suffered blows from which it might never recover.\n\nSo far Israel\u2019s victories are tactical. To get to a strategic victory it would need to coerce its enemies into changing their behaviour. Hezbollah, even in its reduced state, is showing that it wants to fight on. Taking on Israeli infantry and tanks now that south Lebanon has once more been invaded might negate some of Israel\u2019s advantages in air power and intelligence.\n\nIf Iran answers Israel\u2019s retaliation with another wave of ballistic missiles other countries might get pulled in. In Iraq, Iran\u2019s client militias could attack American interests. Two Israeli soldiers were killed by a drone that came from Iraq.\n\nSaudi Arabia is also looking on nervously. Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman has made clear his view of the future. He would contemplate recognising Israel, but only if the Palestinians get a state in return and Saudi Arabia gets a security pact with the United States.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s role, simultaneously trying to restrain Israel while supporting it with weapons, diplomacy and carrier strike groups, exposes the Americans to getting involved in a wider war with Iran. They don\u2019t want that to happen, but Biden has pledged that he will come to Israel\u2019s aid if it becomes necessary.\n\nIsrael\u2019s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, and the damage done to Iran\u2019s strategy and its \u201caxis of resistance\u201d is fostering a new set of illusions among some in Israel and the United States. The dangerous idea is that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the Middle East by force, imposing order and neutering Israel\u2019s enemies. Joe Biden \u2013 and his successor \u2013 should be wary of that.\n\nThe last time that restructuring the Middle East by force was contemplated seriously was after al-Qaeda\u2019s 9/11 attacks on America, when US President George W Bush and Tony Blair, the UK\u2019s prime minister, were getting ready to invade Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq did not purge the Middle East of violent extremism. It made matters worse.\n\nThe priority for those who want to stop this war should be a ceasefire in Gaza. It is the only chance to cool matters and to create a space for diplomacy. This year of war started in Gaza. Perhaps it can end there too.",
    "MP Chris Webb said he was not injured in the attack in the capital\n\nLabour MP Chris Webb has described being mugged in London by a gang who stole his mobile phone. Writing on X, external, the member for Blackpool South said he was attacked as he returned from parliament along Lambeth Walk to his flat in the capital at about 22:00 GMT on Monday night. The Labour MP said that while he is \"not an easy target\" as a \"big guy\" of 6ft 2in, a \"stealthy\" group on bikes clad in balaclavas managed to catch him off-guard. \"Luckily I have no injuries and I am ok,\" he said.\n\nDowning Street said Sir Keir Starmer's thoughts were with Mr Webb. A spokesman for the prime minister said there had been a shocking rise in people snatching bags and phones, and more must be done. Mr Webb told how he was mugged: \"I was walking to the shop. I was on the phone to my wife. \"I then literally said I think I jinxed myself, that I better get off my phone. I don't know this area and it's a bit dark. \"Got to the shop, said that and, as I'm walking away, went to reach into my pocket to get my phone to phone my wife back, and that's when they grab me. \"They grab my arm to stop me and then off they went,\" he said.\n\nThe MP was targeted in the robbery in central London on Monday\n\nThe gang made a quick getaway on their bikes, he added. Webb said he then locked his iPhone using his smartwatch and when police came, he helped them to track the phone to a location where a suspect was caught with a bag of phones and arrested. However, the MP's phone was not recovered. He added: \"I wasn't on the phone at the time and I didn't hear them, which is remarkable in itself, of how stealthy they are, because these are on bikes,\" he added. \"So the fact that, you know, and I'm normally pretty aware of my surroundings, I've got pretty decent reflexes and things like that from training and boxing training. \"And I'm just surprised, because if I grabbed hold of one of them, they would have gone flying on the bike, because I wouldn't have let go. So I'm kind of surprised how they managed to get so close to me without me realising.\"\n\nHe said his first instinct was to chase the group but he quickly realised he should instead get the phone tracked and locked and call the police. \"I don't think I was targeted as an MP,\" he continued. \"While I was in a suit and shirt and tie, they would not have known I was a member of parliament.\" He said the police went \"above and beyond\" to help him. The Metropolitan Police said officers were called at 21:55 GMT on Monday. \"The victim was approached by a group of men who stole his phone from his hand. Inquiries remain ongoing,\" the force said.\n\u2022 None MP sworn in at Commons after by-election win",
    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTasha Ghouri was in tears on Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday night as she opened up about the negative reaction she has experienced online due to her disability. The former Love Island star, 26, and dancer partner Aljaz Skorjanec impressed the judges and got a joint series high score of 39 as they performed to What About Us by Pink. But before the dance, Ghouri, who was born deaf and uses a cochlear implant, became visibly emotional as she told viewers about online trolls who made videos about the way she speaks. She revealed that after her stint on dating show Love Island in 2022, she received an onslaught of cruel comments, leaving her feeling like she had let down \"the whole deaf community\".\n\nThe model, author and podcaster, from North Yorkshire, became Love Island's first deaf contestant when she appeared on the ITV show, eventually finishing joint fourth with boyfriend Andrew Le Page, who she is still in a relationship with. Ghouri said she joined the show to find love, as well as to raise awareness for the deaf community, but instead found herself the victim of online hate. \"When I left the show, I remember my dad sat me down and he looked at me straight and said 'Tash, there is a lot of horrific stuff that was written about you, especially on social media,'\" she said. \"There are videos made about my voice and the way I speak, it became a trend at one point.\"\n\nGhouri said the experience made her hit \"rock bottom\". \"Because I wanted to go on for representation and I feel like I failed, not just myself but, the whole deaf community,\" she said. But she insisted she would not let the trolls win. \"I'm going to use my platform and educate people,\" she said.\n\nToday, Ghouri has more than 2.2 million followers across her social media platforms. She has worked with Number 10 Downing Street and the Department for Education to champion issues on behalf of people who are deaf. Speaking ahead of the start of this year's Strictly series, Ghouri admitted how much the moment meant to her. \u201cI can't believe I'm going to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I\u2019ve been watching the show since I was little and it's a firm Ghouri family favourite, so this is a total dream come true,\" she said. Her appearance comes three years after Rose Ayling-Ellis became Strictly's first deaf contestant, and went on to win.\n\nJB Gill performed with Lauren Oakley, as Amy Dowden watched from the studio\n\nThe remaining 10 celebrities and their professional dance partners took to the ballroom floor on Saturday evening as part of Strictly Come Dancing's inaugural icons week. Taylor Swift and Beyonce were among the stars who were honoured during the show. JLS singer JB Gill and stand-in professional partner Lauren Oakley joined Ghouri and Skorjanec at the top of the leaderboard, scoring the joint highest number of points of this year's series. Professional dancer Amy Dowden, who is partnered with Gill, was forced to miss last Sunday's results programme after being taken to hospital as a \"precaution\" after she began \"feeling unwell\". Oakley stood in for her, performing a Bruno Mars medley with Gill on Saturday's show, which gave the pair a score of 39. The celebration of icons continues on Sunday night, when the professional dancers will perform a Beyonce medley with Johannes Radebe channelling the singer's alter-ego, Sasha Fierce.",
    "New Paddington film charming but slow, critics say\n\nThe nation's favourite bear is back for another adventure\n\nThe much-anticipated new Paddington in Peru film has had mixed reviews over its opening weekend, with critics calling it \"charming-enough\", but some agreeing the film struggles to reach the heights of its predecessors. The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy. The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November. Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.\n\nOf the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian, external that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\". In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote, external that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\". Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, external, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\". He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".\n\nBen Whishaw returns to voice the bear for the third time\n\nThe Telegraph's Tim Robey, external was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant. Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire, external: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears. \"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\" Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, external, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love. \"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"\n\nColman brings a musical charm to the film as the Reverend Mother\n\nThe director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton. Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, external, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\". Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, external, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\". She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\" Away from the big screen, a new Paddington musical is being developed for the stage, with McFly's Tom Fletcher set to write the music and lyrics. On November 7 the cast of the upcoming film unveiled special livery on a Great Western Railway (GWR) train that will travel through Devon and Cornwall.",
    "The city's roads have been blocked with shipping containers to stop the march reaching the centre\n\nSupporters of jailed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan have been pushed back by security forces after reaching the heart of the heavily-barricaded capital earlier on Tuesday. The convoy of opposition protesters has been marching towards Islamabad's D Chowk - or Democracy Square - since the weekend, demanding Khan's release, among other things. At least six people were killed - four paramilitary soldiers, and two protesters - as the march moved through the city, clashing with security forces at points. A number of protesters did make it as far as D Chowk however, and were seen scrambling over shipping containers placed to block their way.\n\nBut hours after protesters reached the square, security forces successfully cleared the area. As darkness fell, the lights were switched off - only police officers and paramilitary soldiers left behind. A police officer nearby said that some protesters had made it beyond the three-tier stack of shipping containers, but only a few hundred metres before they were pushed back. However, thousands of Khan supporters remain in the area - to keep warm in the biting cold, protesters have started burning paper and other materials inside rubbish bins. Many have even resorted to burning grass and bushes on the footpaths and greenbelts, where people are gathered. Muhammad Shahid, who came with his family all the way from Punjab province, says they\u2019re here because of Imran Khan\u2019s message: \u201cHe says we must fight for our rights.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand up for our fundamental rights. Imran Khan has been illegally arrested, and we will fight to make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nKhan, who has been in prison for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated, has urged his supporters not to give up - encouraging people to continue towards D Chowk. \"My message to my team is to fight till the end, we will not back down,\" the former prime minister said on X. Even from behind bars, the former cricket star has proved a powerful player in Pakistan politics. During elections in February, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been banned from standing and was forced to run candidates as independents, emerged as the single largest bloc. However, they fell short of the majority and their rivals united to form a new government. As a result, protesters are also calling for the overturning of election results they say were rigged - a claim disputed by the government. It was Khan who called on his supporters to take to the streets at the weekend, issuing a \"final call\" and asking them to stay in the capital until their demands are met.\n\nThe government - which had already introduced a ban on public gatherings -responded by blocking Islamabad's streets with shipping containers, and bussing in police from across the country. Restrictions also appear to have been brought in on some internet services, while schools and colleges have been shut because of fears of violence. Pakistan's interior minister said the protesters had been offered an alternative venue for their protest but had refused. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who blamed the protesters for the deaths of four soldiers on Tuesday, dismissed the march as \"extremism\". \"These disruptive elements do not seek revolution but bloodshed,\" he said in a statement. Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party, told news agency Reuters at least two protesters had been killed - one shot, and one run over by a vehicle. At least 50 people have been injured.\n\nAdditional reporting by Farhat Javed, Malik Mudassir and Fakhir Munir in Islamabad",
    "Bianca Gascoigne has alleged that she was groomed and sexually assaulted by former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed when she worked at the department store as a teenager. The TV personality, who is the adopted daughter of ex-England footballer Paul Gascoigne, was 16-years-old at the time, and said Al Fayed would grope her and force her to kiss him. She told Sky News, external that she did not speak out sooner because she did not want to bring \"embarrassment and shame\". Gascoigne's comments come after Harrods confirmed to the BBC on Monday that more than 250 people were now in its process to settle compensation claims brought by women who allege historical sexual misconduct again Al Fayed.\n\nWarning: this story contains details some may find distressing The 37-year-old reality TV star and DJ told the broadcaster she used to visit the luxury department store with her parents when she was growing up, and described Fayed as \"charming\" and \"personable\", saying he used to bring the family gifts. \"He used to tell me how much of a bad father my dad was, because he used to come into the store drunk,\" she said. \"He used to tell me that he was an embarrassment, that I should look to him as a father figure.\" She added she felt a \"false sense of security with him early doors\". Gascoigne joined Harrods as a shop floor worker but was later promoted to her \"dream \" job of becoming a fashion buyer. But she said Al Fayed would grope her and force her to kiss him during their weekly meetings.\n\nOn one occasion, Gascoigne was offered the opportunity to stay in the Harrods Park Lane apartment before an early morning work flight. But when Al Fayed turned up at the apartment, she said she was \"gobsmacked\", \"shell-shocked\" and did not know what to do. \"He came in, and then he sat me down on the sofa and was obviously very forceful with the touching and the kissing,\" she said. \"He got his privates out and got my hand and was trying to manoeuvre it on his parts, and when that didn't work, he was trying to force my head on his lap.\" She said she managed to \"wiggle away\" and the encounter was \"horrific\". She thinks Al Fayed knowing who her parents were was what saved her in the moment. \"He was doing all these things to me and I was close to people that he knew, and I felt like I couldn't even tell them either because I didn't want to bring embarrassment and shame,\" she said, adding that not even her mum and dad knew what was going on. Gascoigne said she was also scared of losing her job, and that Al Fayed had warned her that she would if she said anything.\n\nGascoigne, who gave birth to a daughter last year, said she was compelled to talk about her experience after several victims went public with their stories of abuse at the hands of Al Fayed. \"I feel like I have to do this, I want to do this, and I want to stand for the women and just hopefully make any kind of change (so) that in the future, my daughter wouldn't have to go through something like this,\" she said. Lawyers from the Justice for Harrods Survivors group, who represent the accusers of the former Harrods boss, have praised Gascoigne for her bravery, adding they are \"proud to represent her and our other survivors as we move forward together in our quest for justice\". The BBC has approached Gascoigne for further comment. Al Fayed, who died last year aged 94, is accused of sexual misconduct by several women who worked for him - many of whom felt unable to report what had happened until recently. At the time of many of the alleged attacks, the billionaire businessman was the owner of Harrods, the Ritz Paris hotel and football club Fulham FC. The BBC heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-employees at Harrods during its investigation for the documentary and podcast - Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods. The documentary, which aired last month, claimed that during Fayed's ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene but helped cover up abuse allegations. Responding to the investigation, Harrods' current owners said they were \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the allegations and that his victims had been failed - for which the store sincerely apologised.

    "A man was found with a gunshot wound on Linton Road in Barking, said police\n\nA murder investigation has been launched after a man was fatally shot in east London. The Metropolitan Police was called to reports of a man injured in Linton Road, Barking, at about 04:35 BST on Sunday. Officers and the London Ambulance Service found a man, believed to be in his 30s, with a gunshot injury. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

    "How a woman murdered her parents and hid the secret for four years\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"You caught the bad guy\": McCullough's confession was captured on police bodycam footage\n\nVirginia McCullough knew why the police had smashed through her front door, but part of her wondered why it took them so long to discover she had murdered her parents. \"Cheer up, at least you've caught the bad guy,\" she calmly told the officers handcuffing her. Neighbours thought John and Lois McCullough had retired to the seaside, but the reality was they were callously poisoned by their daughter. Why did she do it? The goings-on inside the McCullough family home in Great Baddow near Chelmsford, Essex, were becoming increasingly secretive in 2019. Relatives were asked to stay away and friends were told Mr and Mrs McCullough had retired to the Clacton area on Essex's sunshine coast. The gruesome reality was very different. It would be four years before anyone found out the horrors that took place behind closed doors on Pump Hill. John McCullough, a retired business studies lecturer, had been fatally poisoned and the 70-year-old's body was hidden in a crudely-built tomb made out of breeze blocks and blankets. The corpse of his 71-year-old wife, Lois, was stashed behind sleeping bags and duvets in an upstairs wardrobe. Mrs McCullough had been battered with a hammer and stabbed, but she too had also been poisoned with prescription medication administered by her daughter. Virginia McCullough, 36, was handed a life sentence at Chelmsford Crown Court for their murders, to serve a minimum of 36 years, on Friday.\n\n\"The curtains were always drawn and you couldn't see if anybody was in the house,\" said Phil Sargeant, who lived next door to the McCulloughs for 20 years. \"They were just like shadows, they'd move very quickly from A to B.\" Mr Sargeant now knows why there was such secrecy at his neighbours' house. \"I find it quite difficult even to say that Virginia murdered her parents or killed her parents,\" he added. \"She\u2019d come across as quite pleasant; she was funny, she was irreverent as well. She had a dark sense of humour.\"\n\nIn September 2023, Essex Police took a call from Essex County Council's safeguarding team. A GP at Mr and Mrs McCullough's registered practice had raised a concern for their welfare, having not seen them for some time.\n\nThe corpses of Mr and Mrs McCullough lay inside the family home for four years\n\nJohn McCullough's body was hidden in a makeshift tomb, covered with blankets and paintings\n\nTheir absences had been explained by their daughter, who offered a range of excuses for each appointment she cancelled on her parents' behalf. Conveniently for her, the country had been in Covid-enforced lockdowns for a large period of time they had not been seen. But when police spoke to McCullough, it became clear something was not adding up - why were her parents always out of the area? Alan Thomson, who rented a television to the McCulloughs, also had his suspicions. It followed a phone call from McCullough, abruptly cancelling the rental on her parents' behalf. When Mr Thomson's staff arrived at the family home to pick it up, they were told they could not enter the property - and the TV was already prepared by the front door. \"I got the feeling perhaps she was a bit of a fantasist, but no way would I have thought she\u2019d be a murderer,\" he said.\n\nWhen police raided the property, it was not the first time they had visited. Weeks prior to the discovery of the bodies, McCullough invited officers inside to discuss an allegation of an assault against her. Only she knew the intent of this call, but some believed she was testing the water. Ultimately, the assault allegation came to nothing.\n\nPost-mortem examinations found Mrs McCullough died of stab wounds and her husband was fatally poisoned, although both had been poisoned\n\nMcCullough was more forthcoming when officers returned in September 2023. \"I did know that this day would come eventually,\" she confessed. \"I deserve to get what's coming, sentence-wise, because that's the right thing to do and then that might give me a bit of peace.\" Documents recovered inside the property painted a picture of a woman desperately trying to keep her parents from discovering a financial black hole she had dug. Abusing their goodwill, she had been living rent free, spending their money and racking up large credit card debts in their names. Forged letters showed McCullough had been tricking her parents into thinking they had lost money through scams. In reality, it was money \"frittered away\" by their daughter.\n\nVirginia McCullough continued to spend her parents' pensions after murdering them\n\nTo them, she was well-qualified, suitably employed and working hard towards becoming an artist - a future she claimed would also bring financial benefits for her parents. Instead, she was reaping the financial rewards of manipulating, abusing and taking advantage of her parents' kindness. In total, McCullough benefited from \u00a3149,697 as a result of murdering her parents - combined from their pensions and spending on their credit cards, as well as selling assets. The court also heard she spent \u00a321,000 on online gambling between 2019 and 2023. Her lies - and the fear of being exposed - ultimately led to her cruelly killing her parents.\n\nThe McCullough family home has since been blocked up with metal security barriers\n\nPaul Hastings, a greengrocer at the Vineyards shopping centre near their home, had also noticed their disappearance. He was told by McCullough that her parents, who used to purchase goods from his shop, were no longer living in Great Baddow. Mr Hastings said her peculiar nature meant she could say things without arousing much suspicion. \"She came in to the shop and said 'The police are after me, they think I killed my mum and dad',\" Mr Hastings said. \"I thought 'That\u2019s a bit odd' but didn\u2019t think anything else of it, I just thought it was her eccentric nature.\" He explained McCullough would sometimes visit his shop four times a day, before disappearing for the next fortnight.\n\nVirginia McCullough was \"clearly taking advantage of her parents\u2019 goodwill\", Det Supt Rob Kirby said\n\nDebbie Pollard said McCullough would visit the flower shop she ran and bombard her with food and presents. \"We knew she was odd but I would never have dreamt she would ever be capable of doing what she actually did,\" she said. \"She\u2019s actually lived in that house all those years with her mum and dad\u2019s remains in there - that horrifies me. Horrifies me.\" Both Mr Hastings and Ms Pollard said McCullough had also pretended to be pregnant, even creating a fake bump under her clothing.\n\nDet Supt Rob Kirby said: \"The details of this case shock and horrify even the most experienced of murder detectives.\"\n\nThroughout her sentencing on Friday, McCullough stared at the floor, emotionless. It was only when she listened back to her interview with police, describing how she murdered her mother, that she began to weep. \"She looked so innocent; she was just sat there listening to the radio,\" McCullough told the officers. \"I did go in three times to build up some gumption but I knew I had to get it done and can\u2019t hesitate. \"She was just staring at me in disbelief.\"\n\nVirginia McCullough was jailed for life on Friday, to serve a minimum of 36 years behind bars\n\nDet Supt Rob Kirby, from Essex Police, said her otherwise composed reaction in court was typical of the \"considered, meticulous\" murderer she was. \"Throughout the course of our investigation, we have built a picture of the vast levels of deceit, betrayal and fraud she engaged in,\" he said. \"It was on a shocking and monumental scale. \"McCullough lied about almost every aspect of her life, maintaining a charade to deceive everyone close to her and clearly taking advantage of her parents\u2019 good will. \u201cShe is an intelligent and adept manipulator who chose to kill her parents callously and without a thought for them or those who continue to suffer as a result of their loss.\"\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Essex?",
    "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it \u201cAmerica First\u201d. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington\u2019s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\n\nNato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.\n\u2022 None What Chinese people want from the US The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

    "David Cameron has urged the UK to consider sanctioning two Israeli ministers as a way of \"putting pressure\" on the country to act within international law. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the former Conservative foreign secretary said before the election he had been \"working up\" plans to put sanctions on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. He described the two men as \"extremist\" and said using sanctions would send a message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that \"this is not good enough and has to stop\". The BBC has contacted Smotrich and Ben-Gvir for a response.\n\nLord Cameron said both men had \"said things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into Gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the West Bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out\". Earlier this year, Smotrich suggested it might be \"justified and moral\" to starve Gazans and has called for Palestinian residents to leave and make way for Israelis who could \"make the desert bloom\". Asked why the planned sanctions did not go ahead, Lord Cameron, who was foreign secretary between 2023 and 2024, said he had been advised that it would have been \"too much of a political act\" during the election. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned comments by the Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as \"entirely unacceptable\". Speaking at a Labour conference event, external last month, he said: \"We are very worried about escalatory behaviour, about inflamed tensions. \"I\u2019m absolutely clear, if we have to act, we will act. I\u2019m in discussions with G7 partners, particularly European partners, on that. I\u2019m not announcing further sanctions today but that is kept under close review.\" Asked in Parliament about sanctioning the Be-Gvir and Smotrich, Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said that the government kept its sanctions regime \"closely under review\" and would announce any changes.\n\nItamar Ben-Gvir (L) and Bezalel Smotrich (R) are part of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition in the Israeli parliament\n\nWhitehall sources have told the BBC that Lord Cameron's plan to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on both men had been well advanced and ready to go. The imposition of sanctions requires a detailed and legally binding case which takes time to compile. But they said the decision was put on hold for fear of inflaming political tensions during campaigning for the general election. There were concerns about triggering violence in constituencies where views about the Middle East were polarised. It is also understood the United States at the time opposed sanctioning Mr Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The UK tends to impose sanctions alongside US and the European Union to maximise their impact. The Foreign Office never comments on or predicts future sanctions decisions; however, some sources said any decision on sanctioning the two Israeli ministers might be delayed until after the US election. They also said that with such little UK leverage over Israel, domestic political factors may play a bigger part in any decision. Labour has already restricted UK arms sales to Israel, refunded the UN agency helping Palestinians, and lifted opposition to the International Criminal Court having the right to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.\n\nAnother decision against the Israeli government might be seen as one step too far. The sources also said there was the risk UK sanctions could be seen as a badge of honour by the two ministers. Tom Keatinge, from the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told the BBC that putting sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would be a \"significant move\" aimed at sending a \"major political message\" to Israel. He also said there was \"not a precedent\" for the UK government sanctioning elements of an ally country. He added that there were \"practical issues\" as sanctions required \"a lot of work\" and that the Foreign Office's sanctions director was already \"heavily overworked\" due to issues related to Russia. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office announced new sanctions targeted at illegal settler outposts and four organisations it said had \"supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank\". The three settler outposts hit by the financial restrictions are Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost, Meitarim Outpost, and Shuvi Eretz Outpost. The four organisations targeted are Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva, a religious school; Hashomer Yosh, a non-governmental organisation that provides volunteers for illegal outposts; Torat Lechima, an Israeli charity and Amana, a construction company that has overseen the establishment of outposts. The announcement follows previous sanctions announced in February, external and May., external The foreign secretary said the measures would \"help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights\".\n\nLord Cameron argued the UK government should seek to influence Israel by putting restrictions on some of its ministers instead of pursuing the \"wrong path\" of suspending arms exports. Last month, the UK government restricted arms sales to Israel saying there was a \"clear risk\" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. But Lord Cameron said restricting arms sales to Israel while simultaneously helping to protect the country from Iranian attacks \"made no sense\". The former PM said everyone wanted to see the conflict end, but \"end in a sustainable way\". He said Israel had faced attacks from Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north and it was right to back the country's right to self-defence. \"But it is not a blank cheque, it is not unconditional,\" he said. \"We do want to make sure aid gets through into Gaza, we do want to see the role of the UN in Lebanon to be respected.\"",

    "Woman who starved to death was unlawfully killed\n\nDebbie Leitch's deterioation was concealed by her mother a coroner says\n\nA woman who starved to death after being neglected by her mother was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded. Debbie Leitch, 24, who had Down's syndrome, was found dead at her home in South Shore, Blackpool, on 29 August 2019. Alan Wilson, senior coroner for Blackpool and Fylde, said Debbie died from \"the combined effects of her severely emaciated and neglected state, and debilitation caused by widespread Norwegian scabies mite infection\". Her mother and full-time paid carer Elaine Clarke, who was jailed in 2022 for gross negligence manslaughter, refused to give evidence at the inquest.\n\nElaine Clarke refused to give evidence at the inquest\n\nIn his ruling Mr Wilson stated: \"Debbie [...] had care and support needs, and a range of carers and social care professionals would attend the home regularly to provide that care. \"Unbeknown to them, the standard of care shown by Debbie's mother was at times inappropriate, and she would take steps to actively try to mask how she was treating Debbie.\" He added: \"At other times, she may use disguised compliance to give professionals the false impression that she was doing what she could to comply with any plans to safeguard or promote Debbie's welfare when this was not the case, such as by agreeing to medical appointments which would then be missed, often providing a seemingly plausible explanation.\" Mr Wilson said when Debbie's cousin raised concerns after visiting the family home on 26 July 2019 with social services and her GP practice but by the time the GP arrived, Clarke had \"taken steps to make both Debbie and the house more presentable, and she reassured the GP that Debbie was being appropriately cared for\".\n\nSix days later, a visiting social worker attending the home \"was similarly reassured\". The coroner said Debbie was significantly neglected over the following weeks, remaining largely in her room. On 29 August, emergency services were called to the house and found Debbie lying on her bedroom floor. She had been dead for a number of hours. Mr Wilson said: \"The conditions in which she had been living were described as uninhabitable. \"As a result of the way she had been neglected over the preceding four weeks, a subsequent post mortem examination revealed she died from the combined effects of her severely emaciated and neglected state, and debilitation caused by widespread Norwegian scabies mite infection, which is regarded as a treatable condition. \"Significantly, the fact that Debbie had Down's Syndrome, a learning disability, made it more likely that her mother would be able to persuade others she was providing an acceptable level of care for Debbie.\"",
    "Smart meters enable people to monitor their electricity and gas use\n\nThe way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told. The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers. The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills. The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC. In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers. But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies. It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d. The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan. By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed. As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.\n\nHartesh Battu says he has had six different smart meters and none of them have worked\n\nThe cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly. As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights. Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place. Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car. His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d\n\nWhen the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily. But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us. She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland. This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama. One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date. \u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.\n\nSmart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story? Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).\n\nEnergy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita. Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead. However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d. Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed. It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d. In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits. Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills. The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly. The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d. It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly in, the north. Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home.\n\nDo you use a smart energy meter?

    "Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"very pleased\" MPs will get the chance to debate and vote on the issue of assisted dying. The prime minister confirmed his government would remain neutral on the subject and that his MPs would be given a free vote, rather than having to follow a party line. Asked how he would vote, Sir Keir said his views were \"pretty well known\" but that he would look at the details of the bill being proposed. In 2015, Sir Keir supported an assisted dying bill and last year told reporters: \"I personally do think there are grounds for changing the law\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, Labour MP Kim Leadbeater confirmed she would introduce a bill giving terminally ill people in England and Wales the right to choose to end their life. Leadbeater's bill has yet to be finalised but is likely to be similar to Lord Falconer's proposal which would give terminally ill adults with six months or fewer to get medical help to end their own lives. Assisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Assisted dying is generally used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves.\n\nBackbench MPs do not normally get time in Parliament for their bills to be debated, but the Spen Valley MP's proposal will be allotted space after she came first in a ballot. The bill is expected to be formally introduced in Parliament on 16 October, and a debate could take place within weeks. Even if it is approved at an initial vote, the bill would still be debated at further stages in the parliamentary process. It would also need to be agreed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, before becoming law. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former paralympian and crossbench peer in the House of Lords, said she had concerns \"about the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis\". However, broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has been calling for change, welcomed the bill, telling the BBC: \"All I\u2019m asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice. \"If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die. It\u2019s a choice.\" The Childline founder has lung cancer and last year said she had joined Dignitas, the assisted dying clinic in Switzerland.\n\nDame Esther Rantzen has called for the law to change\n\nAsked about the issue during a visit to Liverpool, Sir Keir said: \"I made a promise to Esther Rantzen before the election that we would provide time for a debate and vote, but that it will be a free vote, and obviously that opportunity has now arisen.\" He added: \"I'm very pleased... that I'm able to make good on that promise to Esther Rantzen.\" Asked by BBC North West Tonight if he would vote in favour of changing the law, Sir Keir said: \"I think my views are pretty well know. Obviously I\u2019ll look at the detail of whatever legislation is proposed. But the government will be neutral.\"\n\nIt is not easy to predict how MPs will vote on Leadbeater's bill. The last time MPs voted on the subject was nine years ago, and the make-up of the House of Commons has changed greatly since then. In 2015, MPs rejected a bill allowing some terminally ill adults to end their lives with medical supervision by 300 votes to 118. Sir Keir was among the MPs backing a change, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson all opposed the bill. Health Secretary Wes Streeting voted in favour in 2015 but is now understood to be \"conflicted\" on the subject. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Breakfast he would vote in favour of the assisted dying bill and described the current law as \"cruel\".",
    "Almost \u00a31bn in funding will go to delivering London-style buses across England as part of a massive Budget boost, the government has promised. The Department for Transport (DfT) has given more details on its plans for 2025 after announcing the funding last month. It has promised to deliver what it calls \"London-style\" services to every corner of the country, and said funding would be allocated based on levels of deprivation and population, instead of making areas compete for investment as it has in previous years. The DfT says Leicester, the Isle of Wight, Torbay, Southend, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are set to receive \"unprecedented\" levels of funding.\n\nIn urban areas, some of the biggest allocations are being given to combined authorities representing South Yorkshire and the Liverpool City Region. In total, there will be \u00a3712m for local authorities to improve services, alongside a further \u00a3243m for bus operators. About 3.4 million people in England travel regularly by bus, making it the most commonly used mode of public transport. Local authorities in all English regions will be able to introduce new bus routes, make services more frequent and protect crucial routes, the DfT says. It added the money will allow more urban areas to maintain high levels of service. Meanwhile, rural communities and small towns will be able to offer more services. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the funding would \"vastly improve\" the reliability and frequency of services, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of the Buses Bill, which aims to give local transport authorities across England new powers to take control of bus services. Under the plans, local authorities would be allowed to introduce a London-style franchising system, meaning they can decide routes, timetables and fares, with operators bidding to run the services for a fixed fee. The government has also pledged to remove a ban on publicly owned bus companies. An extra \u00a3151m will also fund a cap in single bus fares outside London, which rose to \u00a33 last month, until the end of 2025. The Liberal Democrats have called for the government to U-turn on the decision to raise the cap, with the party saying it will hit both commuters and local businesses. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said on Friday: \"The fare cap increase is like a bus tax for people across the country, impacting bus users and commuters already struggling to make ends meet. \"MPs must be given a say on this bus fare hike on behalf of their constituents.\" Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Labour have chosen to increase bus fares by 50% in a further attack on rural communities, working people and pensioners. \"They didn\u2019t have the courage to tell people their plans in the election. This is another broken promise that raises costs on working people.\" But the DfT said the fare cap introduced by the previous Conservative government was due to expire at the end of 2024 and some fares would have soared unless it intervened. \u201cFares will only be allowed to increase with inflation in the normal way, and the \u00a33 bus fare cap will lead to savings of up to 80% on some routes, keeping bus tickets affordable across the country,\" it said.\n\u2022 None More bus services could come under control of councils",
    "Robert Jenrick has accepted the job of shadow justice secretary in Kemi Badenoch's senior team, the BBC understands. The new Tory leader is also expected to name Dame Priti Patel as her shadow foreign secretary and Mel Stride as her shadow chancellor. Dame Priti, Stride and Jenrick were all candidates against Badenoch in the Tory leadership race, with Badenoch beating Jenrick in the final round. By appointing not only former rivals but also figures from different wings of the party, Badenoch will be hoping to unite the Conservatives after a bruising election defeat.\n\nHowever, there was wrangling over which, if any, job Jenrick would take and during negotiations one Conservative source, not close to the leadership, told the BBC: \"Kemi just doesn\u2019t like Rob. She thinks his whole schtick about her and whether she has any policies has done her lasting damage with the right and with Reform voters. \"This is only likely to further unravel.\"\n\nThe pair clashed during the final weeks of the leadership campaign, with Jenrick accusing Badenoch of being \"disrespectful\" to Tory members by failing to set out policies. Badenoch said she would not have used that word and, defending her own approach, said she would not make a promise \"unless I know how I am going to deliver it\". However, following the conclusion of the contest the two candidates exchanged warm words. In her victory speech on Saturday, Badenoch praised Jenrick\u2019s \"energy and determination\", adding: \"You and I know that we don't actually disagree on very much, and I have no doubt that you have a key role to play in our party for many years to come.\" Jenrick in turn congratulated his opponent on her win and urged Conservatives to unite behind the new leader. On Monday, a friend of Jenrick's said: \"Rob thinks the party needs to come together and take the fight to Labour. \"Unity could not be more important. He\u2019s eager to expose Labour\u2019s dreadful record on law and order.\" A formal announcement of Badenoch's full shadow cabinet is expected before its first meeting on Tuesday. Former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott has been given the job of shadow education secretary, with Neil O'Brien appointed shadow education minister. Trott and O'Brien have already appeared in their new roles in the House of Commons at Education Questions. Nigel Huddleston and Lord Dominic Johnson have also been appointed as joint chairmen of the Conservative party, the BBC understands. It follows the appointment of Castle Point MP Dame Rebecca Harris as Tory chief whip on Sunday evening.\n\nThe new shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti, has represented the Essex constituency of Witham since 2010 and served in several government departments during the Conservatives\u2019 time in power. She was forced to resign as international development secretary in 2017 following unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials but was brought back into government by Boris Johnson, who gave her the senior role of home secretary. At the Home Office she started the Rwanda policy, which aimed to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats by deporting them to the East African country but was later scrapped by the new Labour government. A prominent Brexit supporter, she is seen as being on the right of the party. By contrast Stride comes more from the left. Like Dame Priti he joined Parliament in 2010, winning the constituency of Central Devon, and has served in several government departments. A close ally of Rishi Sunak, he was given the job of work and pensions secretary and during the general election was trusted to do frequent media appearances. On Sunday Badenoch told the BBC she thought taxes had been too high under Sunak but has now given one of his most prominent supporters the much sought-after role of shadow chancellor.\n\nLaura Trott served as chief secretary to the Treasury in the Sunak government\n\nNew shadow education secretary Laura Trott has been MP for Sevenoaks in Kent since 2019, and served as number two in the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt when he was chancellor. Neil O'Brien has been MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston since 2017 and was most recently a health minister. He resigned from Sunak's government in November 2023 and took a more critical stance on the then-prime minister from the backbenches. While Trott and Huddleston supported Badenoch in the leadership, O'Brien had supported her rival Jenrick. The current Labour government has 120 ministers, meaning the Tories may struggle to shadow all posts given they only have 121 MPs. Former Home Secretary and defeated leadership candidate James Cleverly last week ruled out serving in the shadow cabinet, telling the FT, external he had been \"liberated\" from 16 years on the political front line and was now \"not particularly in the mood to be boxed back into a narrow band again\". Former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, former Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, former Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell and former Environment Secretary Steve Barclay have also said they will return to the backbenches and not serve in the new shadow cabinet.",
    "Callum Tindal-Draper's family said they have been told their son died on 5 November\n\nA family has paid tribute to their son who has been killed in Ukraine, saying they \"begged him not to go\" but he wanted to help. Callum Tindal-Draper's family said they were informed by the 4th International Legion that the 22-year-old from Cornwall had been killed in action while the foreign volunteer platoon defended an observation point on 5 November. His father Steven Draper said the family were proud of their \"brave\" son, who had told them before going to Ukraine in June he knew the risks he would face and the chances of him coming home were slim. The Foreign Office said: \"We are aware that a British national has reportedly died in Ukraine and stand ready to assist the family in the UK.\"\n\nCallum Tindal-Draper's father Steven said his son wanted to 'stand up to bullies'\n\nForeign Office advice has urged people not to travel to Ukraine while the country is in conflict with Russia. Mr Draper said the family, who live in Gunnislake in Cornwall, had tried to convince his son not to travel out to Ukraine. However, he said once Mr Tindal-Draper had told them he was going out to help no matter what, the family fully supported him with the plan as they knew how passionate he was about it. \"We begged and begged and begged him not to go,\" Mr Draper said. \"But Callum said 'dad, I'm not frightened of bullies and what's going on in Ukraine is awful and someone needs to stand up for these people'.\"\n\nCallum Tindal-Draper's family said they were very proud of him\n\nHis mother Caroline Tindal said the family were all \"so proud\" of Mr Tindal-Draper, who had previously worked at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and as a carer in the community. She went out to visit her son in Ukraine in September and said she noticed he had matured as a person. \"It was such a transformation and he said to me 'mum, coming out here was the best thing that ever happened to me, I've found who I was meant to be',\" Ms Tindal said. \"He found who he was meant to be, he became that person and he lived it.\"\n\nShe added Mr Tindal-Draper's battalion had told the family in video messages and handwritten letters they held him in high-esteem and he was an inspiration to them in Ukraine. Ms Tindal said: \"When we found out he'd died, there was just this hole which I can't describe and it's always going to be there. \"But to know that they are saying he inspired them and they called him their little brother because he was the youngest one out there, they really were a family unit, and that is helping heal us and helping us get by. \"Already that hole I thought could not be mended is being filled with overwhelming love from his family out there and it means so much.\"\n\nSteven Draper and Caroline Tindal said Callum's comrades sent them handwritten notes to say what an inspiration their son was\n\nMr Draper said the hole left by his son's death was \"crushing\", but he was filling it with pride from listening to what his comrades had said to the family. He added: \"It's inspiring me to go out and think what can I do and how can I be as brave and courageous in the things that I do. \"I've got the bravest of the brave as a son as an inspiration and that's really powerful.\" Ms Tindal said the family have not had Mr Tindal-Draper's body back yet, but the family have plans to bury him in Ukraine. She said: \"He wanted to stay in Ukraine and live in Ukraine, so I think even if we had the body we would bury him in Ukraine - that's where he found his home.\"\n\nA tribute to Mr Tindal-Draper has also been paid by Duchy College, where he had been part of its Military and Protective Services Academy. In a Facebook post, external from the academy, Mr Tindal-Draper was described as a \"passionate, articulate and bright student\" who had a strong moral compass. \"He was well liked and respected by his peers, and was not one to shy away from causes he believed in and was instrumental in collecting the three minibus loads of equipment that the learners gathered when the war in Ukraine initially kicked off,\" the post said. \"Callum truly believed in his sense of duty and after working for the NHS after the course, decided it was his duty to help Ukraine and joined the International Legion of Ukraine in the summer.\" It added Mr Tindal-Draper would be commemorated during services being held on Sunday and Monday to mark Remembrance Day.",
    "Why are we building homes when so many are standing empty?\n\nIn an average working day, Claudia Bowring has to play the role of detective, estate agent, family mediator and, occasionally, grief counsellor. She\u2019s an empty homes officer for a borough council in the suburbs of Nottingham. There are just short of 700,000 empty and unfurnished homes in England, according to the most recent government figures, external. Of those, 261,471 are classed as \u201clong-term empty,\u201d meaning no-one has lived there for six months or more. If all empty homes were brought back into use, the housing crisis would be solved at a stroke and, arguably, the government would not have to build 1.5m new homes. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not as simple as that. Bringing derelict and abandoned properties back to life can be a long and complex process. Even finding out who owns properties that have been standing empty for years, or in some cases decades, can be a challenge. Ms Bowring regularly uses a genealogist to track down the owners of long-abandoned houses on her patch in Rushcliffe. They are not always happy to be reminded of their responsibilities. \u201cIn some cases, people don\u2019t really understand the seriousness of their property being empty,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think \u2018well, it\u2019s my house, there is nothing the council can say or do to make me change my mind.\u2019\u201d Often homes become empty when the owners pass away, leading to a long administrative process known as probate, when their assets are divided up. Once that has been settled, families can still be reluctant to part with a property. Claudia Bowring is facing this problem with one of the houses on her patch. \u201cThe children have grown up there, their mum\u2019s died and left them the house, and emotionally they feel quite attached to the property, and me suggesting they should get rid of it or have it for rental is quite difficult to hear. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see someone else living in the property. They\u2019ve got trees that they planted in the garden when they were children, and they don\u2019t want someone coming in and ripping those up.\u201d When persuasion fails, the gloves come off.\n\nLike many local authorities, Conservative-controlled Rushcliffe charges extra council tax on homes that have been unoccupied for more than a year, under the Empty Homes Premium brought in by the previous government. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, the council can take enforcement action. It treats abandoned properties as an environmental health issue - derelict properties can be a magnet for vandalism and vermin, harming the quality of life for people living next to them. In some cases, the council is able to carry out emergency repair work on abandoned homes, and then force a sale at auction to recover its costs. This sometimes results in a windfall for the owners who were so reluctant to sell up in the first place. Another tool at the council\u2019s disposal are Empty Dwelling Management Orders, which give councils the right to take over and make repairs to run-down private properties that have been vacant for at least two years. They can rent the property out for up to seven years to recover costs.\n\nClaudia Bowring keeps an eye out for homes that can be brought back to life\n\nRushcliffe has used these tools and others to bring a modest but steady flow of properties back into use since it started taking the issue seriously in 2019. But it does not have to do this. There is no legal requirement for local authorities to bring empty homes back into use \u2013 and some councils choose not to. Rushcliffe is motivated by a desire to improve the quality of life for its residents and ease the housing shortage. But unlike many councils around the country, it is not in financial trouble \u2013 and does not have a serious homelessness problem. For some hard-pressed authorities \u201cempty homes work is a luxury,\u201d says housing expert Adam Cliff. \u201cIt is not against the law to own an empty property,\u201d he adds, and \u201cdifferent councils have different priorities\u201d. As secretary of professional support group the Empty Homes Network, he wants to raise the profile of empty homes among the public and politicians, as an alternative to building on the green belt land. He argues that there needs to be a central government programme, with a \u201cpot of money for councils to dip into as and when they need money to carry out enforcement,\u201d along the lines of a scheme operated by the Welsh government.\n\nAbandoned homes can be a blight on the neighbourhood\n\nProbate law needs to be reformed to prevent properties \u201csitting empty in perpetuity,\u201d he adds, but above all he believes empty homes need to be put back in the spotlight as a national issue. Campaign group Shelter is also concerned about the growing number of privately-owned empty properties, even if its main focus is on getting more social-rented homes built. Chief executive Polly Neate said: \u201cWe desperately need more genuinely affordable social homes and if the government is serious about its commitment to deliver them, it must do more to bring long-term empty homes back into use. \u201cConverting empty homes is not the silver bullet to ending the housing emergency, but it offers a cost-effective and green way to get more social rent homes built.\u201d Last year, Shelter produced a 10-city plan to rapidly convert 10,500 empty homes, external in the first three years of a new government. But the issue was rarely mentioned during the general election campaign, with only the Green Party putting it in their manifesto. And so far, there are few signs the Labour government regards it as a priority. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"Councils have a range of tools at their disposal to bring empty homes back into use, including charging additional council tax on vacant properties. \u201cWe are committed to building 1.5 million homes and delivering the biggest increase in social and affordable housing in a generation. This will unlock thousands of homes and make the dream of homeownership a reality for more people across the country.\u201d People working with empty homes all seem to have a strong sense of vocation. Adam Cliff said he first got interested in the issue as a teenager, and wrote his university dissertation on it. Claudia Bowring talks about the satisfaction she gets from putting life back into \u201cdead properties\u201d. But with little apparent interest from central government, and council budgets being squeezed, they are unlikely to be joined by new colleagues in the field any time soon.",
    "The Roman archaeological site of Pompeii will limit the number of daily visitors to the site to 20,000 a day after a steep rise in visitors. A record high 36,000 tourists visited the site on the first Sunday of October, when entry was free, local media reported. The park\u2019s management said on Friday that the site would cap its daily visitor number from 15 November. Pompeii, the ancient city buried in an eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in AD79, is one of the best-preserved Roman sites anywhere in the world.\n\nPompeii and its Roman inhabitants were buried in a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius\n\nNearly four million people, external visited the main Pompeii site in 2023, a third more than the previous year. Visitor counts had been climbing in the run up to the pandemic and in 2023 were above pre-Covid levels. In October 2024, there were more than 480,000 visitors, putting the average at about 15,500 a day. The busiest month so far this year was May, when about 517,000 people visited, or some 16,700 a day. The 20,000 cap is likely to only lead to tourists being turned away on a handful of occasions. A spokesperson for the park told Reuters that it had only exceeded 20,000 visitors when entry is free on the first Sunday of the month, as well as three or four fee-paying days.\n\nNearly 4 million people visited the main Pompeii site in 2023, a third more than the previous year\n\nGabriel Zuchtriegel, the park's director, said that reducing the effects of human visitors at Pompeii was important for conservation and safety reasons. The city was devastated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which preserved swathes of it almost intact under a layer of ash for over 1,000 years. About a third of the site has yet to be excavated. It continues to be of huge interest to archaeologists, providing the most complete picture of daily Roman life anywhere in the world. Earlier this year, archaeologists revealed frescos of mythical Greek figures including Helen of Troy and Apollo. The artworks were found in a banqueting hall with dramatic black walls and a mosaic floor made of more than 1 million white tiles.",
    "Workers have been warned their pay will be hit by Budget tax rises aimed at employers. Firms will bear the brunt of the Budget's \u00a340bn total tax rise due to an increase in the National Insurance rate for employers as well as a reduction in the threshold at which they start paying it. Businesses are likely to respond by holding back on pay rises, influential think tanks, the government's independent forecaster and the chancellor herself have all said. \"It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been,\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC.\n\nJames Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank which aims to improve living standards for low-to-middle income families, agreed. \"Even if it doesn't show up in pay packets from day one, it will eventually feed through to lower wages,\" he said. \"This is definitely a tax on working people, let's be very clear about that.\"\n\nOther Budget measures, including a big boost to spending on public services are expected to raise inflation in the short term, which could prevent interest rates falling more quickly. That will also have a knock-on effect on people's spending power. The government has pledged to make economic growth its priority and said people would have more \"pounds in their pockets\" by the end of the parliament. In its general election manifesto, Labour promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\" - explicitly ruling out a rise in VAT, National Insurance or income tax. The pledge has come under scrutiny, with some claiming that Labour have broken it with the rise in employer's National Insurance Contributions (NICs), something the government has denied. The Budget has sparked a debate over how much of the tax rise firms can absorb. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that by 2026-27, some 76% of the total cost of the NICs increase will be passed on through a squeeze on workers' pay rises and increased prices. The OBR expects that as a result of the Budget, average household income - which includes the impact of tax changes directly and indirectly, and benefits - will increase only slowly over the parliament.\n\nHowever, projected income growth is slightly faster than the 0.3% annual average between 2019 and 2024, a period which saw a series of economic blows including Brexit, the pandemic and energy price rises following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The effect of an ageing population is also putting more stress on public finances, especially through higher demand for health services. By 2028 real weekly wages - with price rises taken into account - will have grown by just \u00a313 over the past two decades, according to the Resolution Foundation.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the rise in employer NICs will affect larger firms hiring people on low wages the most, and could lead to fewer minimum wage jobs being available in future. It also warned that lower pay rises could mean the measure raises significantly less than a forecast \u00a325bn. It highlighted a forecast by the OBR that it could end up raising \"just\" \u00a316bn if, for example, businesses award smaller wage rises. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, also warned of likely further spending and tax increases part way through the parliament. He accused the chancellor of playing the \"same silly games\" as previous governments by \"pencilling in implausibly low spending increases for the future in order to make the fiscal arithmetic balance\". \"I suspect we\u2019ll end up with even more spending, possibly considerably more spending than is currently planned,\" he said. \"That will probably mean, unless she gets lucky with growth, more tax rises to come next year or the year after.\" Economic forecasts published by the OBR alongside the Budget suggest UK growth will pick up over the next two years, but then fall back to a more moderate pace, in large part due to Budget measures that are likely to push up prices and interest rates. Mr Johnson described the forecasts as \"pretty awful\".\n\nThe Resolution Foundation also warned that the decision to frontload increases to spending on public services into this year and next means the Spending Review in the Spring will be tough. Reeves has also left herself with a \"relatively slim margin of headroom\", it said. The chancellor's new debt rule allows more room for manoeuvre but most of that money has already been used up, which means that even a small economic downturn could force the government to increase taxes further in the future, the think tank said. Opposition parties were quick to criticise Reeves, with shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying she had taken the \u201ceasy route\u201d by \u201cpicking the pockets of businesses\u201d to fund public spending. He said the strategy would lead to \u201clower growth, lower living standards, lower wages, businesses employing fewer people. \u201cIt\u2019s businesses paying their taxes that pay for our public services and what we did not hear yesterday is a plan to grow the economy and that is what we need,\u201d he said. Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey said the chancellor was repeating the mistakes of her Conservative predecessors. \u201cRaising employer\u2019s National Insurance is a tax on jobs and High Streets, and it will make the health and care crisis worse by hitting thousands of small care providers,\u201d he said. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, said his government had taken a \"responsible\" approach in order to \"fix the foundations\" of the economy.",
    "Kat Booker said she felt told what to do, instead of being given neutral information during her pregnancy with Nancy\n\nA mum whose daughter has Down's syndrome said she felt \"pushed towards termination\" during her pregnancy. Kat Booker, 42, said information about her daughter Nancy's condition was \"very negative\" and made her feel \"horrendous\". Charity group Seren Dwt said language used in pregnancy could have a \"massive impact\" on experience. Antenatal Screening Wales said it was important information was offered in an \"unbiased and non-judgemental way\".\n\nMs Booker, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she felt she was being told what to do throughout her pregnancy, rather than being given information neutrally. \"I felt like I was being pushed towards termination, because it was the easier thing to do,\" she said. \"I was just being told how difficult everything was going to be and all the things that Nancy quite possibly wouldn\u2019t do, but not being given any other information as in there are children living quite happily with Down's syndrome.\"\n\nKat Booker said she had no doubts about her decision to carry on with her pregnancy\n\nShe said Nancy, four, was a \"dream\" who \"wears her out in the most fun way possible\". Born during the Covid-19 pandemic, she remembered being alone at appointments, needing more support. \"I couldn\u2019t really compute what was going on,\" she said. \"It was only after I left, and I was thinking about it, I got really quite angry about the way that I\u2019d been spoken to.\"\n\nOther mums of children with Down's syndrome said they had similar experiences. Laura Howard, mum to \"cheeky and feisty\" Tomos, four, said receiving his diagnosis after he was born felt \"very much like a bereavement situation\". \"We had a nurse coming in and being quite upset, saying 'oh, you\u2019re too nice a people to have this happen to you',\" she said. \"It\u2019s from good intentions that they\u2019re trying to say that, but it is still creating this whole negative situation around what is just a baby first and foremost.\"\n\nLaura Howard, Laura Thomas and Lou Kennedy (far right) set up a charity after their experiences of having babies with Down's syndrome\n\nAlong with two other mums - Lou Kennedy and Laura Thomas - she set up Seren Dwt, a charitable organisation gifting Welcome Boxes to babies with Down's syndrome across Wales. \"Having these boxes is saying there is a support group for you,\" Ms Howard said. \"You are not alone, and your child will be alright, there\u2019s lovely, positive things that they can achieve and there is a community ready and waiting with open arms for you.\" All three agreed language was incredibly important. \u201cI wish I could go back and tell myself two hours after she was born, when we realised, that you\u2019re going to be OK and she\u2019s going to be OK and life is not going to be doom and gloom,\u201d said Ms Kennedy.\n\nThe welcome boxes, which include knitted hats, cuddly toys and biscuits, are given as gifts to celebrate babies with Down's syndrome\n\nThe organisation provides the policies, standards, and framework to enable maternity services across Wales to provide screening tests, usually ultrasounds or blood tests, for those who choose to have them. She said their role was to ensure information was \"robust\" and \"evidence-based\", offered in an unbiased and non-judgmental way. \"For example, we would use language like 'probability' or 'chance'. We would not use the term 'risk'.\n\nSarah Fox says unbiased information should be given to expectant parents\n\n\"We would talk about 'conditions' not 'diseases',\" she explained. Ms Fox said they trained all student midwives around how to verbally offer screening tests, as well as providing written information in different formats. It is just one part of the entire maternity care system, but she said she understood the need to listen to feedback. \"We are up for the challenge. \"We want to consistently improve and make better training and collaborate more closely with maternity services and with families to make sure that the training is fit for purpose, and the information is fit for purpose to enable that unbiased, informed choice.\"\n\nGareth Thomas, a sociologist at Cardiff University University, has done extensive research with healthcare professionals, and written a book about the language around disability in pregnancy and antenatal care. He said he wanted to see \"why we're so invested in screening and how it affects healthcare professionals, as well as expectant parents\". He said it was simplistic and offensive to blame staff, when so many are \"conscientious\" and the \"victims of various pressures, not least time\". His research from 2017 found the term \"risk\" was being used in clinics, which might suggest how deeply ingrained that discourse around disability is, in systems and society.",
    "Bradley Nelson was left with disabilities, after being shaken by his dad as a baby\n\nA boy left blind and brain-damaged after being attacked as a baby by his father has died in hospital, prompting a fresh police investigation. Bradley Nelson, nine, was left severely disabled and unable to walk after being assaulted by Darren Spreadbury in April 2016, when he was seven months old. Despite being born \"fit and well\" Bradley was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Nearly nine years later, Bradley, from Whitby, died at Scarborough General Hospital last month after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn May 2018, Spreadbury was sentenced to four years in prison, after scans found Bradley\u2019s brain injuries had been caused by shaken baby syndrome. \"Bradley was blind because he shook him that hard, he snapped his optic nerve and he had a can of Coke\u2019s worth of blood between his brain and his skull,\" Bradley's mum, Sharon Boocock, said. Doctors later determined he had suffered a brain injury that was \"unexplained and non-accidental\", leading to the arrest of Spreadbury. He pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was handed a 10-year restraining order, as well as being sent to prison.\n\nBradley underwent several operations in the years following the attack\n\nIn the years following the attack, Bradley needed \"24-hour care\" and was unable to walk, talk or feed himself, according to his mum. He underwent several operations and suffered complications and infections. Ms Boocock said her life at the time was devoted to staying in to look after Bradley. \"I couldn\u2019t go anywhere after 17:00 because Bradley would come home from school and that was me housebound,\" she said. She explained how she had juggled her job as a bartender to earn \"whatever money she could\" and said she was \"learning to live again\". Last month, Bradley was sent home from school after complaining about feeling sleepy. He was taken in to hospital and Ms Boocock and her partner, Jonny Nelson, were told he had suffered a seizure after falling unconscious. Bradley died on 22 October after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nBradley was described by his mum as \"always smiling and happy\"\n\nSharon said, despite everything, Bradley had been \"always smiling and happy\". Last week, police informed her they were investigating the cause of his death. A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: \"We have been made aware of the death of a nine-year-old boy from the Whitby area, who sadly passed away in hospital on October 22. \"The child had complex medical needs and an investigation into the cause of his death is currently under way, reflecting due process in such circumstances.\" A fundraiser has been launched on GoFundMe by Sharon\u2019s friends to help cover Bradley\u2019s funeral costs.

    "Janette Ward consults a paper timetable at her bus stop - she says the tracking app can be unreliable\n\nThe 12:40 bus has just driven past Janette Ward\u2019s stop seven minutes early as she watches from the other side of the road, waiting to cross. There won\u2019t be another for two hours. \u201cIt makes it very difficult when you\u2019re going for an appointment or you\u2019re connecting to a rail service or other bus service,\u201d says Ms Ward, 74. There\u2019s also been further changes to make her journey more complicated, she says. Janette now has to take four buses to see her daughter in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Before, she only needed to change buses once. Her situation is by no means unique. The frequency of rural bus services in England has reached a historic low, according to a report by the County Councils Network. They found more than a quarter of rural routes had been lost over the decade to 2023.\n\nAnd last week's UK Budget revealed that the \u00a32 cap on bus fares in much of England will increase by \u00a31. It could mean an extra \u00a340 a month for someone who gets a return five days a week. Since then dozens of people have got in touch with BBC News, many saying that buses remain fundamentally unreliable. Some passengers say there's a lack of digital screens at bus stops and live app updates for some routes outside of cities, unlike trains and Ubers where many are used to tracking journeys in real time.\n\u2022 None What issues really matter to you? Let us know\n\nAnd even where tracking exists, it can sometimes be out of date. Take Leeds, for example, where some locals claim they've had to endure \u201cghost buses\u201d - they\u2019re advertised as coming on live displays at bus stops, but never do. \u201cFor people who rely on the bus as their only means of getting to work it\u2019s impossibly frustrating,\u201d says Cllr Eleanor Thomson, who runs a Facebook group for bus passengers in the Yorkshire city. \u201cSome people in the area have moved because they\u2019re that fed up of it, or they\u2019ve bought a car, which is costing them a lot of money.\u201d Bus operators told the local authority in January they\u2019re installing 4G technology to improve tracking, but Cllr Thomson says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be getting any better\u201d.\n\nJanette Ward relies on her local bus to see her daughter and go to appointments\n\nJanette has similar experiences of unreliable service updates in Hereford. \u201cOn bank holidays, sometimes the tracking service doesn\u2019t know if a bus is coming at all,\u201d she says. Campaigners think bringing the entire bus network into the 21st Century would give people more confidence in the service and make them more likely to use it. \u201cIf you know that your bus is coming in five minutes, then you know you have that certainty,\u201d says Silviya Barrett, director of policy and research from the Campaign for Better Transport. \u201cWhereas in some bus stops there isn't even the basic timetable, let alone the live arrival updates.\u201d\n\nDoreen Gower, who doesn\u2019t drive, uses the bus regularly to attend hospital appointments in Hereford. Now that her service only runs once every two hours, she feels she sometimes has to find alternatives because of the inconvenience. \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling very well, you don\u2019t particularly want to have to wait for another two hours for a bus. It means that I maybe have to pay \u00a325 for a taxi to get me home,\u201d she tells us. She also relies on volunteers, who provide a ring-and-ride service, to bring her to and from her local GP surgery in a neighbouring village around 20 minutes away.\n\nAs well as passengers, poor rural bus services are costing employers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty grim, some businesses are completely cut off from public transport,\u201d says Natalie Fryer, who has been appointed by Cumbria\u2019s tourism board to improve the situation. \u201cEmployees are walking down dark roads from their closest bus stops or train stations, with employers concerned for their safety. Some businesses say they put up staff in their own homes just so they can stay open.\u201d In an attempt to work around the problem, Gilpin Hotel, which lies in the heart of the Lake District, spends \u00a38,000 per month on taxis bringing some of its 137 staff to and from work. Many don't drive, a common occurrence in the hospitality sector. Helen Tappenden, who oversees personnel at the hotel, says the business has to \"put our hand in our pocket\" to avoid recruitment and retention problems. \u201cFor our staff it can feel very isolating because, while they might love working here, without a bus route they struggle to have some normality - like popping to a coffee shop or a cinema,\" she tells the BBC. And 40 miles away at Muncaster Castle - which is popular with visitors and wedding guests - Ewan Frost-Pennington lets some staff stay in a house on the grounds because of the lack of transport connections. \"That's got six young people living in it, of which I think two can drive,\" says Ewan, whose family have lived in the castle for 800 years.\n\nEwan Frost-Pennington provides staff housing to help keep Muncaster Castle running\n\nThe UK Government insists it recognises the current service offered by bus operators is unsatisfactory for many passengers - particularly in rural areas and it will introduce a new law to address that. Officials say the forthcoming buses bill will allow councils in England to deliver better services as they could choose to take control of them. Under this franchising system, councils could be able to decide routes, timetables and fares - with operators bidding to run services for a fixed fee. In London and Greater Manchester, where this system is active, bus fares will remain capped at \u00a31.75 and \u00a32 respectively after the new England-wide cap rise - and some passengers told the BBC they felt this risked widening regional inequality. But experts warn this kind of system is not suitable for all communities and that it works best when a council area includes both urban and rural parts.\n\nCampaign for Better Transport Silviya Barrett says some councils may choose not to run bus services as they don't have the expertise\n\n\u201cThe benefit is that if you have both of these, the more profitable ones in urban areas can pay for the services in rural areas,\u201d says Silviya. She adds that another reason why some councils may choose not to operate a franchised bus system is that they no longer have the expertise. \u201dThey haven't managed buses to this extent since privatisation,\u201d she says. In 1986, services outside of London were deregulated and privatised. Before then most bus services were operated by publicly owned companies, which were often run by councils. Some experts say bus services would also be made better if the way they are funded was made simpler - as currently there are six separate pots councils can apply to for money. \u201cStreamlining bus funding into a single, long-term pot would give councils greater control over services and spending and residents more long-term certainty over future services,\" says Cllr Adam Hug, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association.\n\nA bus belonging to DRM who operate the service in Herefordshire used by Janette and Doreen\n\nGraham Vidler, from the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus operators, tells us: \"We accept that passengers face a mixed picture depending on where they live.\" He said better technology at bus stops was the responsibility of local councils but that many would struggle to find the money to upgrade them given their tight budgets and the fact there are so many. \"In contrast to the rail network, where there is a manageable number of stations, there are tens and tens of thousands of bus stops across the country.\" Louis Dyson, managing director of DRM Buses, which operates the route in Herefordshire that Janette and Doreen use, says the company had cut the route from hourly to two-hourly because of a drop in passenger numbers. \u201cIf as much funding was given to support rural services, rather than making city buses run every 15 minutes, then perhaps there would be more options for the public,\u201d he says. Dyson says that when buses were running late it was usually caused by bad traffic, roadworks, bad weather and a lack of bus lanes - factors outside of drivers\u2019 control. And in response to claims that passengers can\u2019t always view accurate information about when DRM\u2019s buses are arriving, he says vehicles have ticket machine tracking software but that the rural location of services interfered with their connectivity. Dyson says the service that Janette and Doreen regularly take would be changing to hourly \u201cin the next month or two\u201d if it gets approval from officials. For people like Janette and Doreen, that can\u2019t come soon enough. For them buses are what give them their independence and a chance to see family and friends. \u201cWe\u2019re only asking for the service we had before to be reinstated,\u201d says Janette. \u201cNothing more.\u201d",
    "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it \u201cAmerica First\u201d. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington\u2019s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\n\nNato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.\n\u2022 None What Chinese people want from the US The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

    "Badgers are mainly nocturnal animals and dig setts underground that can extend some distance\n\nBadgers tunnelling under a road in Lincolnshire have caused \u00a3100,000 worth of damage, a council has said. The mammals had dug a sett under the A52 at Seaholme Road, in the middle of Mablethorpe, according to Lincolnshire County Council. Emergency repairs to the road would have to be carried out to stop it falling apart, a spokesperson for the authority said. However, the council had had to wait for a licence from Natural England before the work could be carried out because badgers were a protected species, they added.\n\nThe authority had wanted to carry out the repairs earlier, but now the licence had been granted, it was running out of time to do the emergency work, according to the spokesperson. All work on badger setts must be completed between July and the end of November so the repairs did not interfere with the badgers' mating season, they explained.\n\nSeaholme Road joins the A52 which runs along the seafront at Mablethorpe\n\nCouncillor Richard Davies said: \u201cIn total, these works are going to cost us an additional \u00a3100,000 to complete.\u201d The Mablethorpe area already has road closures on the A1104 for resurfacing work, and Davies said the authority was aware of traffic flow issues in the town. The A1104 scheme could not be paused as it was at a critical point, he said. \u201cOur hands are tied about scheduling these conflicting works,\" Davies explained. \"We have no option but to get this additional programme up and running straight away. \"If there was any other option available to us, we\u2019d take it.\" Davies added that it was \"extremely frustrating we have not been given this licence until now\". The council spokesperson said the work would be carried out between 09:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT from Saturday 8 November and Wednesday 20 November. A three-way traffic light system would operate outside those hours so the road could be used. Natural England has been approached for a comment.

    "Primark owner Associated British Foods (ABF) has said the recent Budget may lead it to invest more outside the UK over fears the High Street will bear the \"weight of tax rises\". George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"We\u2019re an international business as well, we have choices about where we will invest.\" It comes as the owner of the fast fashion brand reported a 43% rise in profits before tax, reaching \u00a31.9bn over the year to 14 September. It said \"challenging weather\" had hit the number of people visiting its shops between April and June, but expects a strong performance over Christmas.\n\nFollowing its latest update to investors on Tuesday, the boss of ABF said it is preparing for a rise in costs after new measures were introduced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. During Labour's first Budget in 14 years, the chancellor set out changes including an increase in employers' national insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Weston said they would see ABF's wage bill \"go up by tens of millions\". \"It's quite clear to me that this a Budget where the weight of the tax rises are falling on business - within that, it's fallen particularly on the high street,\" he added. During an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Ms Reeves said that she was not \"immune\" to the criticism her plans have received. She suggested that the money raised would help put public finances on a \"firm footing\". The decision to increase NI contributions made by employers has come under fire from many businesses. Despite the prospect of rising costs, Mr Weston said in an interview with the PA News agency that there was \"no intention\" for Primark to raise its prices for the rest of year. Overall, Primark sales across the UK and Ireland grew by 0.7% in the year to 14 September, stripping out the effect of new shops opening. It said that sportswear, jumpers and pyjamas had done particularly well among its womenswear ranges.\n\nThe fashion giant said that it had seen a strong start to the sales of its autumn and winter ranges, despite wetter weather washing out those of summer shoes and beachwear. Primark saw a 6% growth in sales in the year overall and saw shirts and leisurewear items do well among men. It comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned of a \"disappointing\" October. The BRC suggested that shoppers were holding back on spending on bigger-ticket items until the \"Black Friday\" sales. Its latest figures suggest that total retail sales across the UK increased by 0.6% year-on-year in October, a drop against 2.6% seen in October 2023. \"This was part driven by half-term falling a week later this year, depressing the October figures, and November sales will likely see more of a boost,\" its chief executive Helen Dickinson OBE said. Ms Dickinson suggested that the Budget and rising energy bills might have \"spooked some consumers\" and blamed more mild weather recently for delaying winter purchases of items like coats and jackets. Elsewhere on Tuesday, online retail giant Asos reported mounting losses, reaching \u00a3393m in the year to 1 September. The group's turnaround plan has seen it reduce stock and launch clearance sales to shift old ranges. Chloe Collins, head of apparel at research firm GlobalData, suggested that the retailer has failed to \"combat the enormous threat\" from other companies include the likes of Shein, as well as the rise of second-hand clothing markets like Vinted. But Asos boss Jose Antonio Ramos Calamonte said there were some \"green shoots\" in the performance of its new clothes ranges in recent months. \"We will do things in the right way and we're going to be patient,\" he said.",
    "Seven new lawsuits filed against Sean 'Diddy' Combs\n\nSeven new civil lawsuits have been filed against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in a federal court in New York. Four men and three women accuse the hip-hop mogul of sexually assaulting them at various parties in Los Angeles, New York and Las Vegas. The youngest plaintiff was 13 at the time of the alleged incident. Mr Combs remains in custody at a Brooklyn jail. He is separately facing federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, which he denies. The BBC has approached his legal team for comment on the new cases.\n\nHis lawyers recently dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity\", stressing that \"Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d All seven of the new civil cases allege that Mr Combs - or by proxy through his associates - drugged alcoholic beverages at the events that made the plaintiffs dizzy, nauseous and feel outside their bodies. In several of the suits, plaintiffs allege that Mr Combs raped them, forced oral sex on them, or aggressively groped them. Mr Combs is currently awaiting trial in May of next year for the federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. The hip-hop icon has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has been denied bail multiple times. The indictment, along with several lawsuits, implicates his various business enterprises, alleging they played a role in facilitating and funding his abusive actions both inside and outside the music industry. The lawsuits further accuse Mr Combs of leveraging his power and influence in entertainment to manipulate, intimidate, and silence those around him.\n\nOne new case alleges Mr Combs and another male celebrity raped a 13-year-old girl at an after-party for the 2000 VMAs. The second male celebrity is not named in the lawsuit. Another alleges Mr Combs drugged an independent musical artist at a party and raped her. She says she woke up in pain and with imprints on her arms suggesting she had been tied with ropes while she was unconscious. In a third case, Mr Combs allegedly exposed himself to a man, and then grabbed the man's genitals in a \"rough\" and \"sexual\" manner. A fourth involves a celebrity personal trainer, who Mr Combs allegedly assaulted at a party at his Hollywood Hills home in 2022. The trainer says he saw many high-profile celebrities engaging in group sexual activities at the party, where he was later brought into a small room with Mr Combs, who removed the personal trainer's pants and performed \"non-consensual oral sex onto him\". The fifth new filing concerns a woman who alleges she was drugged at a party at Mr Combs' hotel room and woke up naked in bed with the rap musician talking on the phone in the corner of the room. The sixth case involves a man who ran a security firm. He alleges that he was invited into a private room by Mr Combs at a party, and he was then given a drink that made him feel dizzy and nauseous. He claims that Mr Combs then stuck his hands in his pants and grabbed his genitals. The seventh case, as reported by US media, was a 17-year-old aspiring musician who alleges he was assaulted at a party by Mr Combs. Mr Combs has faced almost a year of allegations, ranging from rape and sexual assault to grooming and domestic violence. One lawyer recently said more than 100 clients plan to sue the musician for sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. He is currently in jail while he awaits his trial in New York. Prosecutors alleged that he also engaged in kidnapping, forced labour, bribery and other crimes. They described him as the head of a criminal enterprise that abused women, using threats of violence to force them into participating in drug-fuelled orgies with male prostitutes. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was denied bail. His trial is due to take place in May 2025.",
    "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, external and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US. Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad. Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\" But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy. Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering. Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.\n\nMr Adani, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire, is a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n\nIndia\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share), seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market). With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide. His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa. Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.) \u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.\n\nAdani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday\n\nThis crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI. \u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC. For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects. \"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"\n\nMr Adani has faced challenges in Kenya over a planned takeover of an international airport\n\nThe latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal. \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC. What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes. Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.\n\nOpposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded the arrest of Mr Adani\n\nWhile the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong. \u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says. Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says. \"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d",

    "Disability Wales chief executive Rhian Davies has also added her concerns about the cut in the winter fuel payments\n\nMore pensioners will die because of the decision to withdraw the winter fuel payment, Wales' older people's commissioner has said. Rhian Bowen-Davies said UK ministers needed to reverse the decision that will see 90% of pensioners between 66 and 79 lose the payment. The Labour-run UK government said cuts were necessary to address what it called the financial \"black hole\" it inherited from the Conservatives. \"People will feel the impact of this,\" said Ms Bowen-Davies. \"We know that this could impact on 4,000 additional deaths this winter.\"\n\nShelia Burgess from Magor, Monmouthshire, began working at 15 and thought she would be able to claim her state pension at 60, but was then caught out by government changes to the rules. She is one of the so-called Waspi women who were born in the 1950s and say they didn't have enough time to prepare for the fact that they would have to work years longer before being able to claim their state pension.\n\nMs Burgess is now expecting to lose the winter fuel payment, external which had been \"something that made us not have to worry if the weather got very cold\". \"I appreciate it's not a huge amount of money but that \u00a3300 during the winter months is a big help,\" she said. The UK government's own figures showed 83% of people over 80 would lose the payment, rising to 90% of those aged 66 to 79. Other groups will lose out too, with 71% of pensioners with disabilities having the payment taken away.\n\nRhian Bowen-Davies, the older people\u2019s commissioner for Wales, is warning that more people will die as a result of the winter fuel payment cut\n\nDisability Wales chief executive Rhian Davies said some people needed every penny. \"They need to have warm homes [and] perhaps because of vision impairment they'll need to have good lighting. They need to be running equipment,\" she said. \"Many disabled people of whatever age often have higher fuel costs and need to have greater use of electricity, heating, directly related to their impairment.\"\n\nCaerfyrddin MP Ann Davies highlighted concerns about one of her constituent losing the winter fuel payment during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions\n\nThe plight of Welsh pensioners was raised by Plaid Cymru's Caerfyrddin MP, Ann Davies, during Prime Minister's Questions, external when she highlighted the case of constituent, Janette Crawford, whom she said suffered with ME and chronic pain. \"The cold, damp conditions of a Welsh winter are going to mean a lot more muscle soreness and fatigue for her,\" she said. \"She has lost her winter fuel payments due to having a very small savings pot. \"With 86% of pensioners in poverty, or just above that line, to miss out in Wales, will the prime minister establish a social energy tariff to help people like Janette?\" Sir Keir Starmer said his government had \"inherited a \u00a322bn black hole\" and Conservative MPs \"should be apologising... for leaving the country in such a state\". He said government was committed to the pension \"triple lock\" which would increase by \u00a3460 next year. \"That means pensioners under Labour will be better off because we are going to stabilise the economy after that lot lost control of it,\" he said.\n\nPension expert Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said people who have lost the payment had options such as applying for pension credit. \"You can look to see if you can qualify for the warm home discount, external, which is a rebate of \u00a3150 off your fuel bills\u2026 if you are genuinely really struggling with these energy bills this winter, speak to your supplier and see if they can help you,\" she said. She does not think Chancellor Rachel Reeves will change course during this month's Budget but \"one thing that could perhaps happen is to maybe soften it around the edges a bit\". She said that could include some kind of support for people who \"don't quite qualify for pension credit\".\n\nConservative social justice spokesman Joel James said Labour ministers \"must listen to the stark warning\" by the commissioner. \"Tens of thousands of people from Wales alone have signed petitions calling on Labour to reverse this nonsensical decision,\" he said. \"There is still time to change course before the winter and give pensioners the reprieve they deserve - before it's too late.\"",
    "The government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since Labour won the general election. It is the week where farmers are heading for Westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them. Among those expected outside Parliament on Tuesday is the country\u2019s most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, Jeremy Clarkson. Guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.\n\nNearly three weeks on from the Budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing. There is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected. BBC Verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers. But beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors. Indeed, speaking on The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and the president of the Countryside Alliance, said the government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax relief \u201csmell of incompetence\u201d and that a \"large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community\". Two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from Sir Keir Starmer down that they are not going to change their minds. And secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows Labour had with many in rural Britain the last time it was in power. Twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central London to highlight the needs of rural communities. The initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting. As farmers head for Westminster, the prime minister has been heading for South America - he is at the G20 Summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies in Brazil for the next few days. But the issue followed him into the skies of the south Atlantic, where he said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the \u201cvast majority of farms and farmers\u201d would not be affected by the changes. \u201cIt's important for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d he said. The truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the Budget. I asked Sir Keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.\n\nSir Keir Starmer says supporting farmers is \"very important\"\n\nAsked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, Sir Keir said \u201cit's very important that we support farmers.\u201d He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside. \"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming. \"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union. Incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in England as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas. It shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don\u2019t handle this well. So why has this row become so noisy so quickly? From the conversations I have had, I think there are three main reasons.\n\nFirstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it. The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21. Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed. For others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone. Secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by The Economist magazine: \u201cNever pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children\u2019s book.\u201d Trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes. Think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food. Thirdly, I am told it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context. \u201cIt is the straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back,\u201d is how one farming source put it to me. There was the new trade deal with Australia, which many farmers think undermines them. There are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after Brexit. And there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. There have been five farming ministers in the last five years. Put them all together and there is a disillusion and a widespread sense among farmers of not being listened to. Westminster is certain to hear them this week.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Cowboys, murderous revenge plots and family secrets have kept Yellowstone fans hooked since 2018. It is one of the most watched shows in the US and turned creator Taylor Sheridan into the king of prime time television. But last year, Paramount announced that the fifth season, which is due to end next month, would be the last. Its star, Kelly Reilly, tells me it will be \"an ending to the Yellowstone world we have known\". \"Does it mean it's the end of me playing her? Maybe, maybe not,\" she says. \"We don't know yet is the honest answer.\" There have already been two Yellowstone spin-offs, with more in the works. Reilly, who plays the troubled and volatile Beth Dutton, says she would \"love\" to keep playing her character, but any spin-off \"would be a new beginning somewhere\". It sounds like something is possibly in the works, though, with Reilly saying she \"can't talk about the future because there are so many conversations happening\".\n\nYellowstone's drama on screen has been mirrored off screen, with the departure of its leading man, Kevin Costner. He only filmed half of season five because of what he says were contract and scheduling issues, external. Sheridan has said, external it was down to Costner's wish to focus on his Horizon film series, which the star is directing, co-writing, producing and starring in. Either way, it leaves British-born Reilly as arguably the star of the show. The daughter of a police officer and a hospital receptionist, the actress was born and brought up in Chessington, Greater London. A far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nShe has previously starred in True Detective, Prime Suspect and Above Suspicion. But Yellowstone has introduced her to a huge international audience. I ask how it feels to be an in-demand leading lady. \"Well, I'm 47 years old, it hasn't happened overnight, you know. So it's not like I'm getting whiplash,\" she laughs. \"I have been a working actor for 30 years. It's not lost on me that there's a unicorn of shows that have such success worldwide and a character that has had this amount of attention or appeal. \"But I treat it at arm's length. I don't spend too much time thinking about it. I have a very normal life. It's very important to me that my life is normal. Nothing has changed, other than I'm really busy. \"I don't get to sleep at home very often, which is annoying because I love home!\"\n\nKelly Reilly with her on screen husband Cole Hauser\n\nMost fans assume Reilly is herself an American, not the softly spoken Brit she is in reality. She tells me that when Yellowstone started, she \"didn't do any press\" because she wanted people to believe in her character. \"People talk to me as if Beth is real,\" she says. \"We all talk about Beth like she's a real-life person. \"I'm always going to be a bit of a let down when people meet me. I go into the local bakery and the lady is like, 'I'd love to drink with you.' \"I know what she means - she wants to drink with Beth. People want to feel part of that energy... someone so connected with their primal self. \"And we're so disconnected. We're all on our phones, on social media. It is like it doesn't happen if someone doesn't take a picture of it. Beth is the opposite of that. She is just so alive.\" To say Reilly's character has been put through the wringer would be an understatement. Beth has survived attempted rape, attempted murder, crushing heartbreak and being betrayed by family members. She even exclaims: \"I am the rock therapists break themselves against.\" Reilly describes Beth as a \"powerhouse\", telling me it's been \"such a fun adventure to put her on\". \"I'm very introverted,\" she adds. \"I don't have any dreams of vengeance in my life. \"There\u2019s something really exciting about playing her. I feel like I\u2019m on an adrenaline rush for four months while I play her, and when I\u2019m finished I\u2019m like, I now have to go back to my quiet, boring life. And I'm very grateful for my quiet, boring life after I've played her. \"But by the time every summer comes around where I'm sort of gearing up again and the scripts start coming in, I get excited again to meet her. \"I'm very aware of the gift of her as a character, but I lock her up in a padlocked box for six months of the year.\"\n\nKelly Reilly on set on Yellowstone with Luke Grimes\n\nThe character of Beth quickly became a fan favourite, with articles devoted to getting her character's look, and thousands of social media posts about her. One of Beth's most memorable lines of dialogues, \"You are the trailer park, I am the tornado\", is even printed on T-shirts. What does Reilly put that popularity down to? \"She\u2019s unequivocally herself and unapologetic about that,\" she says. \"And as a woman, it is so refreshing and so much fun to play.\" The actress believes Beth \"has penetrated a zeitgeist in women specifically\". \"I think it is that unencumbered kind of freedom that she moves through the world with. She is not afraid of dying, she is not afraid of losing. \"There is a scene in season two where she is being attacked by a man who is in the process of raping her and is about to kill her and she is covered in blood. \"She will not be a victim to him. And I think for women and for me, I love that. She is fierce.\" After all the trauma her character has experienced, Reilly says she \"goes through different phases\" of considering what a happy ending would be for Beth. \"I trust Taylor and his vision for her. He loves her so much,\" she says. \"I would like something cathartic, potentially. I would hate to leave her out in the wilderness. But I don't know if happiness is something any of these characters strive for. \"They strive to protect, they strive to kill, they strive to be killed. These are not looking for peaceful lives.\" Yellowstone season five part two is on Paramount from Sunday, 10 November.",

    "There were more than 440,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March\n\nShoplifting is at \"unacceptable\" levels and not being tackled properly, a Lords inquiry has found. The crime is seriously under-reported and the problem is so urgent police forces need to take \"immediate action\", according to the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee. It says retailers need to be able to report crimes more easily, more funding is needed for offender rehabilitation, and regulations should be introduced to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods online anonymously. The Home Office said it was making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence and deploying \"thousands\" of police officers dedicated to tackling shoplifting.\n\nThe Lords committee held an inquiry into tackling shoplifting in which it heard evidence from police chiefs, retailers and industry experts in May and September. In a letter published today, it said there were more than 443,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March 2024 \u2013 the highest ever since records began 20 years ago. But they were \"a drop in the ocean\" when compared with likely real figures estimated at 17 million annually \u2013 which has \"devastating consequences for businesses and families\". Shop theft has evolved from \"individualised offending to relentless, large-scale, organised operations accompanied by unprecedented levels of violence\", it added. Tracey Robertson, co-owner of Paw Prints \u2013 a small chain of pet shops across Yorkshire \u2013 says shoplifting costs her business around \u00a38,000 a year. \"It\u2019s a financial impact on a family business. It\u2019s bad in the fact that it affects the staff that work for us because sometimes it\u2019s aggressive and violent,\" she said.\n\nTracey Robertson, who owns a small chain of pet shops in Yorkshire, says shoplifting costs her around \u00a38,000 a year\n\nThe committee supported schemes like Project Pegasus - a partnership between retailers and police to tackle organised shoplifting gangs - but said there needs to be a strategy to deal with local prolific offenders too. \"The scale of the shop theft problem within England and Wales is totally unacceptable and action, like that under way in the Pegasus scheme, is vital and urgent,\" said Lord Foster of Bath, chair of the committee. The committee found there is a widespread perception that shop theft is not treated seriously by the police which \"risks undermining confidence in the police and wider criminal justice system\". It said shoplifting cost the retail sector nearly \u00a32bn last year \u2013 which resulted in price rises impacting individuals, families and communities. \"We acknowledge the pressures on police resources, but we believe that the urgency of the situation relating to shop theft requires immediate action within existing police staffing levels,\" the letter said. It has made a series of recommendations to the government which it says would \"help tackle the problem and keep the public and our economy safer\".\n\u2022 None Phasing out the use of the outdated term \"shoplifting\" which serves to trivialise the severity of the offence\n\u2022 None Developing improved reporting systems to enable retailers to report crime to the police quickly and easily\n\u2022 None Introducing regulations to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods on online marketplaces anonymously\n\u2022 None Introducing regulations and best practice guidance for the use of facial recognition technology by private companies Shop owner Tracey Robertson believes the recommendations do not go far enough and wants to see much tougher sentences for repeat offenders. Professor of criminology Emmeline Taylor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said the committee recommendations are \"far-reaching\" and understand the multiple root causes of shop theft. \"If adopted by the police, the industry and the government it will certainly do a huge amount to begin to turn the tide on the tsunami of shop theft that has impacted the retail sector across the UK.\"\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said it welcomed the report which further highlights the significant impact retail crime has on its victims. \"We are doing all we can to reduce thefts and pursue offenders, especially those prolific and habitual offenders, who cause misery within the community,\" said Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman, the NPCC\u2019s lead for acquisitive crime. The Home Office said it understands the \"devastating impact\" of shop theft has on communities. A spokesperson added: \"We are taking immediate action through our commitment to scrap the \u00a3200 shop theft threshold, and making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence. \"We will also put thousands more dedicated police officers on our streets, and establish a Retail Crime Forum for retailers to confidently implement tactics against shop theft.\"",
    "Trump ally says Ukraine focus must be peace, not territory\n\nTrump has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources\n\nA former adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in Ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by Russia. Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a \"realistic vision for peace\". \"And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious,\" he said. \"Crimea is gone.\" A spokesperson for Trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza \"does not speak for him\".\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's east. The president-elect has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on US resources, in the form of military aid to Ukraine. But he has yet to divulge how he intends to do so - and will likely be hearing competing visions for Ukraine's future from his various advisers. Mr Lanza, a Trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern Ukraine, but he said regaining Crimea from Russia was unrealistic and \"not the goal of the United States\". \"When Zelensky says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once Crimea is returned, we've got news for President Zelensky: Crimea is gone,\" he told the BBC World Service\u2019s Weekend programme. \"And if that is your priority of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you're on your own.\" The US has never deployed American soldiers to fight in Ukraine, nor has Kyiv requested American troops fight on its behalf. Ukraine has only requested American military aid to arm its own soldiers. Mr Lanza said he had tremendous respect for the Ukrainian people, whose \"hearts are made of lions\". But he said the US priority was \"peace and to stop the killing\". \"What we're going to say to Ukraine is, you know what you see? What do you see as a realistic vision for peace. It's not a vision for winning, but it's a vision for peace. And let's start having the honest conversation,\" he said. In response, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn characterised Mr Lanza's remarks as placing the pressure for peace on Ukraine when it was \"Putin who wants more war\". \"Putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front. What does this indicate? It is obvious that he wants to fight on,\" he said. \"Ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals. And it is Russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of Russian strikes.\" A spokesperson for Trump's transition team - which prepares the incoming administration for office - said Mr Lanza was \"a contractor for the campaign\", but \"does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him\". Trump is expected to handle peace talks with a close circle of aides once in office. An unnamed National Security Council aide who previously served under Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday: \"Anyone - no matter how senior in Trump\u2019s circle - who claims to have a different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn\u2019t know what he or she is talking about.\" They said that the former president \"makes his own calls on national security issues\" and had done so \"many times in the moment\". Trump spoke to Zelensky after his election win, with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part in the call.\n\nZelensky and Trump after a meeting in the US earlier this year - they spoke on the phone on Wednesday\n\nA source in Ukraine's presidential office told the BBC that the \"good lengthy conversation\" between Zelensky and Trump lasted \"about half an hour\". \u201cIt was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things, but overall it was very warm and pleasant.\u201d Trump's Democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for Ukraine that will endanger all of Europe. The prime minister of Estonia told the BBC that if Ukraine backs down from the conflict, \"Russia\u2019s appetite will only grow\". Kristen Michal told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"The question probably is that if you start giving up, then you should be prepared to give more. \"For Russia it\u2019s quite understandable that if you draw a line somewhere and use the force to back it up, they will back up too, but not by politeness, that\u2019s not the plan.\"\n\nLast month, Zelensky presented a \"victory plan\" to the Ukrainian parliament that included a refusal to cede Ukraine\u2019s territories and sovereignty. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d, but never gave further details. A paper written by two of his former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue supplying weapons, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, the paper said, but it should negotiate based on current front lines. Earlier this week, Putin congratulated Trump on his election victory and said Trump's claim that he can help end the war in Ukraine \"deserves attention at least\". Mr Lanza also criticised the support the Biden-Harris administration and European countries have given to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"The reality on the ground is [that] the European nation states and President Biden did not give Ukraine the ability and the arms to win this war at the very beginning and failed to lift the restrictions for Ukraine to win,\" he said. Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives approved a $61bn (\u00a349bn) package in military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion. The US has been the biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - between February 2022 and the end of June 2024, it delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $55.5bn (\u00a341.5bn), according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation. Clarification: This article has been amended to reflect that Bryan Lanza stopped working as an adviser to the Trump campaign after the election.",
    "Ben Earl scored his first try of England's Autumn Nation Series campaign\n\nEngland ended their five-match losing run with a nine-try hammering of Eddie Jones' Japan at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium. The victory marked a first and only win of a difficult Autumn Nation Series campaign for Steve Borthwick's side after close defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Captain Jamie George scored twice in a clinical opening period, which saw Ben Earl, Sam Underhill and Ollie Sleightholme also grab tries. The Brave Blossoms managed one eye-catching score in the first half through captain Naoto Saito. Full-back George Furbank gathered Tommy Freeman's sublime behind-the-back pass to score England's sixth try in the second half, before replacement hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie burrowed over the line for the first of his two tries. Flanker Kazuki Himeno's try gave Jones' side a deserved second-half score, but the hosts finished the strongest with Tom Roebuck adding to Cowan-Dickie's score for his first international try. It was Borthwick's side's first win since June when they comfortably beat Japan 52-17 in Tokyo. Former England head coach Jones, who was sacked by the Rugby Football Union in 2022 and later replaced by Borthwick, kept a low profile in the build-up to his return, having been in charge during England's joint-worst run since 2018 of five straight defeats. His successor ends the year with five wins from 12 games as Borthwick continues to navigate a tough transition period following a third-placed finish at last year's Rugby World Cup. At least one statement scalp would have been expected after signs of progress in this year's Six Nations and during the summer Tests against New Zealand, meaning a sole win over Japan to end a dreadful run will instead go down as an autumn to forget.\n\nDespite three intense fixtures on the bounce, Borthwick opted against wholesale changes as he offered his regulars a chance to finish the autumn on a high. The final quarter of matches has proved to be England's sticking point in recent games, with late leads blown against New Zealand and Australia. What has remained a strength is their ability to start fast and that continued when Marcus Smith sent Ollie Lawrence through a hole and the Bath centre found Earl who ran under the posts for the opening score. Flanker Underhill then showed his power for the second week in a row close to the try-line to extend the lead, before captain George dotted down twice from rampaging mauls. That ability to close out a tight Test match was never likely to be challenged by the Brave Blossoms, who despite improvement under Jones, were heavily defeated by New Zealand and France this autumn. However, Japan's high-paced attacking style finally clicked as Saito got on the end of Dylan Riley's break after some slick handling from inside their own half. But the hosts were able to respond through an equally impressive flowing move when Will Stuart's initial break led to Sleightholme's sharp finish in the corner, as the Northampton Saints wing showed his instinctive finishing ability by regathering his own grubber kick for a fourth autumn try.\n\nTommy Freeman set up George Furbank's try with a sublime behind-the-back pass\n\nAn outrageous piece of skill from Freeman, who flung the ball behind his back to set up club team-mate Furbank, then raised the volume in an Allianz Stadium. In their games against the All Blacks and world champions South Africa, England had failed to score after the 60th minute. Following Himeno's try, any concern over whether they could finish strongly was quickly answered by Cowan-Dickie's second try from close range. Replacement Roebuck, who impressed off the bench, showed his lethal finishing skills from Fin Smith's crossfield kick, fending off one defender before a sharp step sent him over. For England, a full house of victories over rugby's big three southern hemisphere sides was always a big ask. Small margins prevented them from picking up at least one other victory than this, but ending their miserable run was at least a step forward for Borthwick after a challenging month.",
    "Pubs face widespread closures unless the chancellor announces an extension to business rates relief in next week's Budget, the UK's biggest pub company has warned. David McDowall, boss of Stonegate Group, whose pubs include Slug & Lettuce, Yates's and Walkabout, said thousands of landlords currently make just 12p of profit for every pint of beer they sell. Help on business rates for the hospitality sector in England and Wales is set to run out in April. Mr McDowall said that if it is removed, small publicans will see their business rates bill quadruple from April.\n\nAlong with other costs the businesses are facing, he feared \"they don\u2019t have any more to give\". Rates relief was introduced for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes in 2020 in response to the Covid pandemic when businesses were forced to close. In the Budget in November last year, the then Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced it had been extended until April next year. The measure means that companies in England can claim 75% relief on business rates up to \u00a3110,000, or 40% for firms in Wales. Mr McDowall told the BBC's Today programme that the hospitality industry has faced a \"barrage\" of challenges in recent years. These include recovering from Covid as well as high inflation, energy costs in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the effect of the cost of living on customers. \"The complete removal of that rate relief would prove very, very costly for pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes up and down the length and breath of the UK\", he said. The British Beer and Pub Association recently revealed that landlords make 12p profit per pint. The average price of a pint of draught lager was \u00a34.79 in September, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile, a freeze on alcohol duty is scheduled to end on 1 February next year. Mr McDowall is one of a number of representatives from the hospitality industry who this week signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves asking for relief to be extended. It warned about \"the onrushing business rates cliff edge\" facing firms 153 days after she delivers the Budget.\n\nOn Thursday, UKHospitality and the British Retail Consortium, whose members also benefit from relief, said that in the year to March, businesses in these sectors paid nearly \u00a39bn in business rates. This is nearly a third of the total amount of revenue the government raises from business rates. They said that if relief is removed, it would cost hospitality and retail an additional \u00a32.5bn. Earlier this week, UKHospitality also called on the chancellor to stick to Labour's manifesto pledge to reform business rates. The amount businesses pay is based on how much annual rent could be charged on the premises - which is known as the rateable value. UKHospitality argued that, because its businesses can usually be found in central locations such as High Streets, the cost to companies is high. Without reform \"investment in our high streets will be curtailed, employment opportunities will be squandered and ultimately, we will see higher levels of business failure,\" it said. A spokesperson for the Treasury, said: \u201cWe\u2019re supporting businesses like our well-loved pubs through pledges to make the business rates system fairer, cap corporation tax at 25% and to publish a corporate tax roadmap so that they have some welcome certainty to plan for the future.\u201d\n\nWhat do you want to see in the Budget, how do you think it will affect you personally and what would you like us to explain?",
    "Comedian Godley to go on 'final tour' before funeral\n\nGodley died on 2 November while receiving palliative care for terminal cancer\n\nThe funeral of comedian Janey Godley will take place over two days across two cities as part of a \u201cfinal tour\u201d of Scotland. A hearse will travel through Edinburgh on 29 November in tribute to her \u201cbeloved festival home\u201d before returning to Glasgow on 30 November for the ceremony. The funeral for the comic, who died on 2 November aged 63 after receiving palliative care for terminal cancer, will take place at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral in the city\u2019s west end. Her daughter, Ashley Storrie, confirmed the arrangements on social media.\n\nGodley, who found viral fame with her dubbed parodies of then Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon's coronavirus news briefings during the pandemic, revealed she had ovarian cancer in November 2021. She had been due to embark on a tour entitled \u201cNot Dead Yet,\u201d but was forced to cancel it after her condition worsened. Godley was given the all-clear in 2022 but later that year announced another scan had shown signs of the disease in her abdomen. In the social media post her daughter said: \"Here's the details of Janey's final tour, thank you for all the love and kindness in this past week. \"For the past few years of Ma's life, it was important to her that she shared her journey with everyone, to offer support for others on the same path and to highlight the symptoms of Ovarian Cancer - all of course in her very singular Janey style, with laughter and candour. \"So many of you who have travelled with us on this journey wish to bid her a final farewell, so here's the details of my mum's final tour, in the two cities she loved with all her heart.\"\n\nThe hearse will travel along the Royal Mile and Lawnmarket in Edinburgh with a \"pause for reflection\" at St Giles' Cathedral before travelling along Cockburn Street, Market Street and on to Glasgow. After the funeral on Saturday there will be a private service at a crematorium. Ms Storrie said her mother asked that instead of traditional funeral attire, those who wish to do so should wear bright colours to celebrate her life. She also asked that no flowers be sent but said people were invited to contribute to the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice or any charity of their choice. Godley won the inaugural Sir Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow Award at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival. She died peacefully in the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow, surrounded by her loved ones, her management company said last weekend.",

Aftermath of deadly Israeli strike on press building in Lebanon\n\nThree Lebanese journalists have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a building known to be housing reporters in south-eastern Lebanon, witnesses have told the BBC. The attack was carried out on a guesthouse in a compound in Hasbaya being used by more than a dozen journalists from at least seven media organisations - with a courtyard containing cars clearly marked with \"press\". The men worked for broadcasters Al-Manar TV and Al Mayadeen TV, which issued statements paying tribute to their killed employees. Lebanon's information minister said the attack was deliberate and described it as a \"war crime\". The Israeli military says it targeted a Hezbollah structure, but is reviewing the incident.\n\nThose killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda from pro-Iranian news channel Al Mayadeen, as well as camera operator Wissam Qassem from the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar. The Lebanese ministry of health said three others were injured in the blast. Five reporters had been killed in prior Israeli strikes in Lebanon, including Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah. Footage broadcast by Al-Jadeed TV - whose journalists were also sharing the house - showed a bombed-out building with a collapsed roof and floors covered in rubble. A vehicle used for TV broadcasts was overturned on its side, its satellite dish mangled with cabling nearby. \"All official parties were told that this house was being used as a stay-house for journalists. We coordinated with them all,\" an Al-Jadeed journalist, caked in concrete dust, said in a live broadcast while panting and coughing. Lebanese journalists covering the conflict in the south of the country had to relocate from nearby Marj'youn to Hasbaya, as the former became too dangerous. In a statement hours after the incident, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had struck a Hezbollah military structure in Hasbaya from where \u201cterrorists were operating\u201d. The incident showed that proximity to \"terrorist infrastructure poses a danger\u201d, the force said. It added: \u201cSeveral hours after the strike, reports were received that journalists had been hit during the strike. The incident is under review.\u201d\n\nYoumna Fawwaz, a reporter for broadcaster MTV Lebanon, told the BBC that journalists in the compound were awoken at around 03:00 local time (01:00 BST) by the strike. She said ceilings had fallen in on them, and they were surrounded by rubble and dust, with the sound of fighter jets overhead. Each news organisation had their own building in the compound, she said, and the building housing the Al Mayadeen reporters was \"obliterated\" while Al-Manar employees were inside. Ms Fawwaz said it was a media compound known as such to both Israel and Hezbollah. \"The airstrike was carried out on purpose. Everyone knew we were there. All the cars were labelled as press and TV. There wasn't even a warning given to us.\" She added: \"They are trying to terrorise us just like they do in Gaza. Israelis are trying to prevent us from covering the story.\" Lebanon's information minister accused Israel of intentionally targeting journalists, in contravention of international law. \"The Israeli enemy waited for the journalists' nighttime break to betray them in their sleep,\" Ziad Makary wrote in a post on X. \"This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with prior planning and design, as there were 18 journalists there representing seven media institutions.\"\n\nHasbaya, about five miles (eight kilometres) from the Israeli border, is inhabited by Muslims, Christians, as well as people from the Druze ethnic and religious minority. It has seen attacks on its peripheries in recent weeks, but this was the first strike on the settlement itself. The attack comes as part of an expanding conflict in Lebanon, where Israel has been intensifying air strikes for weeks - as well as launching a ground invasion on border towns and villages in the south. On Friday UN peacekeepers said they were forced to withdraw from an observation post in Zahajra, in the south-west, after it was fired on by Israeli forces earlier this week. Unifil has accused Israel of targeting its bases several times in recent weeks, causing injuries to peacekeepers. Israel denies this and has blamed previous incidents on clashes with nearby Hezbollah fighters. In the northern Bekaa area, the Israeli military has confirmed it attacked the Jousieh border crossing between Syria and Lebanon overnight - which it said was being used by Hezbollah and Syrian security forces to smuggle weapons. Lebanese authorities have recorded over 1,700 air strikes across the country in the past three weeks. Hostilities broke out between Israel and Hezbollah on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people. The Iran-backed armed group has since been firing rockets and drones into Israel in what it described as \"solidarity\" with Palestinians in Gaza. Nearly 2,600 people in Lebanon have been killed in the current conflict, according to the country's health ministry - many of the deaths occurring since Israel began escalating its attacks on 23 September. Around 60,000 people in northern Israel have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire, and the Israeli government has declared returning them to their homes to be a key objective. Two people were killed on Friday in a Hezbollah rocket attack on Majd al-Krum, a town near Karmiel in Israel's north, according to a statement, external from the country's foreign ministry. In southern Lebanon, satellite imagery examined by the BBC shows Israel's intensified bombing campaign has caused more damage to buildings in two weeks than occurred during a year of cross-border fighting. Data shows that more than 3,600 buildings in Lebanon appear to have been damaged or destroyed between 2 and 14 October - about 54% of the total damage. The attack on journalists in Lebanon comes days after the Israeli military accused six Al Jazeera journalists working in northern Gaza of being affiliated with Hamas or other armed Palestinian groups. The Qatari broadcaster said it denies and \"vehemently condemns\" the allegations. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 123 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a war in the territory last year. Gaza's Hamas-run health authority has reported more than 42,000 people killed since. Two Israeli journalists have also been killed in the conflict.",
    "Lucy Letby discussed the death of a baby in a \"gossipy way\", the inquiry has heard\n\nLucy Letby emailed her colleagues at the Countess of Chester Hospital claiming she had been \"exonerated\" and asking them to be \"sensitive and supportive\". The Thirlwall Inquiry into Letby's crimes heard the former nurse wrote the email in January 2017, six months after she had been removed from frontline clinical duties. She claimed that \"a thorough investigation\" had established that \"all allegations were unfounded and untrue\u201d and that she had \"received a full apology\" from the hospital trust. Letby had been moved into an administrative role after a group of consultant paediatricians persistently raised concerns about the deaths and collapses of babies on the neonatal ward.\n\nSix months later the consultants were told to apologise to Letby after two independent reviews reported there was no evidence of deliberate harm. A grievance procedure against her removal from the ward had also been upheld. The email said: \"As you can imagine this whole episode has been distressing for me and my family. \"I will begin my return to the unit in the coming weeks. I will need colleagues to be sensitive and supportive at this time.\" Letby never returned to the unit, which the inquiry previously heard was down to the \"persistence\" of consultants who suspected her of being a murderer. The inquiry also heard from a nurse who recalled Letby telling her about the death of a child in an \"excited\" and \"gossipy\" way. Melanie Taylor said she could not remember which baby's death Letby was referring to, but recalled how she spoke about it. She said: \"It was almost in a way that she was excited to tell me, almost in a gossipy manner.\" The inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall is examining how the killer nurse was able to murder and attack babies at the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2015 and 2016.\n\nLady Justice Thirlwall is chairing the inquiry, which is being held at Liverpool Town Hall\n\nRachel Langdale KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Ms Taylor if the way Letby spoke about the baby's death struck her as unusual or disrespectful. Ms Taylor said: \"Yes, it did. There were parts of [Letby's] personality that were a little strange to me, so I took that as a personality difference between me and her.\" The inquiry also heard about text messages Letby had written about the death of a baby who was later found to be one of her victims. Ms Taylor said the message showed a \"lack of compassion\". In the messages, Letby said she wanted to get back to the nursery where the boy died to get over the death. Her colleague replied Letby needed to \"let it go or it'll eat you up\". Letby said: \"I need to go back and have a sick baby [to take care of], otherwise the image of the one you've lost never leaves you.\"\n\nMs Taylor told the inquiry she had never heard of going back to the unit where a death occurred as a way of dealing with or getting over trauma. When asked what she thought about Letby wanting to go back to the nursery where the baby had died, Ms Taylor said it was \"highly inappropriate\", adding: \"The text messages I've seen show a lack of compassion.\" Ms Taylor told the inquiry she did not have any suspicions at the time that Letby could be harming babies. \"That's an unthinkable thing in a way. \"Nursing is a profession where you put your trust in each other, and I mean this is not an event that happens in anybody's lifetime.\" Another nurse told the inquiry Letby had shouted at her for suggesting she should take a break from working on the intensive care unit after a baby died. Nurse Kathryn Percival Calderbank said she had made the suggestion for Letby to spend time on the special care unit - where babies were not as poorly - so she could do nice things like feed and cuddle babies. \"She was really angry with me. She felt it was boring looking after special care babies,\" she said. Letby, 34, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after being convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. The inquiry is expected to sit until early next year, with findings published by late autumn 2025.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Man who got on 'wrong plane' arrested\n\nEasyJet said a passenger had \"incorrectly\" boarded the plane\n\nA flight was delayed at Manchester Airport after a man \"incorrectly\" boarded the plane, EasyJet has said. The BBC understands an airport passenger had been due to fly on another EasyJet flight but gained entry to the Milan-bound flight on Friday evening in error. All passengers had to disembark the plane as extra security checks were carried out in line with standard procedure. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said a man had \"embarked on a flight without the correct documentation\".\n\nNothing suspicious was found on board and there was no suggestion that it was terror-related. An EasyJet spokesman said that the flight was \"subject to additional security checks, in line with procedures, due to a passenger incorrectly boarding the flight\". \"Safety and security is our highest priority and so we will now work with our ground partner at Manchester Airport to understand how he was able to board the flight.\" On Saturday, a GMP spokesman said a man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of hiding himself with the purpose of \"being carried in an aircraft without consent and intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\". An EasyJet spokesman said the company was \"not able to provide further details while [the investigation] is ongoing\".",

    "Stokes doubtful for first Test against Pakistan\n\nBen Stokes has not played for England since the end of July\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes is a doubt for the first Test against Pakistan in Multan as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury. Stokes, 33, has been out since the beginning of August, missing the 2-1 series victory over Sri Lanka. England trained in Multan for the first time on Friday. All-rounder Stokes batted in the nets and bowled a handful of deliveries off a few paces. He indicated last week he is unlikely to bowl at the beginning of this three-match series, which gets under way on Monday. Opener Zak Crawley told BBC Sport: \"He seems to be going well, recovering well from his injury. \"We don't know just yet. I think he's got to do a few more tests, but he's been doing some running and stuff.\" If Stokes is fit to play, but not bowl, England will have a decision on how to balance their side. Against Sri Lanka they played five specialist bowlers, which would mean leaving out one of their regular top order.\n\nTo avoid dropping a batter, or even leaving out wicketkeeper Jamie Smith and handing the gloves to Ollie Pope, England could play four specialist bowlers and lean on Joe Root's off-spin. Curiously, balancing the side might be easier if Stokes is ruled out completely. Pope would continue to deputise as skipper, Smith could remain at six, leaving space for the five bowlers, which seems particularly necessary in temperatures of around 36 degrees. Crawley said the Multan pitch currently has a \"green tinge\", so England may feel the need for three seamers and two spinners. With pace bowler Olly Stone set to leave the tour for his wedding and Josh Hull ruled out of the tour with a quad injury, Brydon Carse could be in line for a Test debut, possibly vying for a place in the side with Durham team-mate Matthew Potts. \"We've got a really deep squad, with plenty of options with the ball and with the bat as well,\" added Crawley. \"We've got bowlers who can bat really well, as proven in the summer. We feel ready. Whatever team comes out, it will be a nice balance either way.\" Crawley is also returning from an injury after spending more than two months out with a broken finger. The 26-year-old damaged the little finger on his right hand attempting a slip catch as England wrapped up a 3-0 series win over West Indies at Edgbaston in July. He was unable to hold a bat for five weeks, then returned to training just over two weeks ago. Though Crawley believes he is fit to return to his usual fielding position of second slip, he has been given medical advice to refrain from doing so yet. \"I feel brand new,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to getting out there. I've certainly missed it, so I can't wait to get out there again with the boys. \"I've come back with a new hunger. I feel like I've got a lot of energy. No one wants any time out and I wouldn't choose to do it again, but I've taken some positives from it for sure.\" Test Match Special will have live ball-by-ball commentary of England's tour of Pakistan on BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Cardiff woman quits drinking over fear she would die by Christmas\n\nAfter an 18-hour bender that finished at 9am, the \"beer fear and anxiety\" got too much, and Jessie Hallett knew she had to quit drinking. For more than a decade, weeks would go by without a day of sobriety - but now the 29-year-old realised she had a problem, and may not make it to Christmas if she didn't stop. New figures from DrinkAware, external - a charity that works with the alcohol industry - show that 89% of drinkers in Wales are using at least one technique to moderate their drinking. The statistics show a rise in 18 to 34 year olds who never binge drink, with more in the Generation Z age group turning to \"intermittent sobriety\" where they want to give up drinking at least for periods of time.\n\n\"I was burning the candles at both ends, I was working long days and instead of going home after those shifts I would go out after it,\" said Jessie. \"I would drink the next day to avoid the hangover. \"Then all of a sudden weeks go by and you realise you haven't had a day go by without a drink.\" Jessie, who lives in Cardiff, said she drank socially from a young age - but it's when she started working in hospitality she noticed her drinking habits changing, going out after shifts finished. Then the pandemic hit, which made her drinking much worse. \"I was severely depressed at the time, my mental health was in the bin,\" she added. \"I was having panic attacks and anxiety and the only way to mask that was through drugs and alcohol.\"\n\nJessie uses her social media to raise awareness about sobriety\n\nThings came to a head on Beaujolais Day 2022 - a French event that toasts the wine harvest every November, that has become popular in Wales. Jessie said: \"I'd gone on an 18-hour bender. I got home at nine in the morning after being out all day. \"The beer fear and anxiety was too much. \"After that moment, I knew. If I hadn't given up drinking, I wouldn't have made it to Christmas.\" The next day she told friends and family, and their reaction made her realise she had made the right decision. \"Not one person who was close to me questioned it,\" said Jessie. \"That to me was alarm bells, everyone knew that was something I had to do.\"\n\nSince going sober, Jessie goes to the gym five or six times a week and has lost five stone in weight\n\nAfter almost two years of being sober, her whole life has changed. \"I could never have imagined the life I'm living now. I was really unhealthy when I was drinking,\" she said. \"I've lost five stone [31.75kg], I go to the gym five or six times a week, I have a new passion for fitness. I get up at 5am every day. \"My career has absolutely taken off, I haven't even had a cold since being sober.\" Jessie runs a social media company and says it's quite \"ironic\", because 90% of her clients are involved with alcohol. \"It empowers me that I can be around booze and the industry and say you don't have the power over me anymore,\" she said.\n\nNon-alcoholic events are becoming popular in the UK, especially with students. Intermittent sobriety is the new buzz term among Gen Zs who want to give up drinking, but not completely. Chris Evans, 23, from Aberaeron, Ceredigion, has teamed up with business development service FOR Cardiff, external to launch the My Drink, My Choice campaign. It aims to promote alternatives to evening activities centred around drinking, while normalising the decision to avoid alcohol. \"I come from a small town, and coming to Cardiff it is easy to get into a culture of drinking alcohol,\" Chris said. \"I didn't even drink much until coming to university, it's easy to get swept up in it all.\"\n\nAlthough Chris still drinks he is aware of why people make the choice not to. \"International students who can't or choose not to drink alcohol didn't even cross my mind,\" he said. \"Events like this gives a chance to give somewhere safe for people to socialise and to be confident to be yourself.\"\n\nGP Dr Will Mackintosh, who is based in St Clears, Carmarthenshire, believes younger people have better insight into how alcohol and binge drinking can affect them. \"Traditionally, older people, when they think of alcohol abuse, they think of liver disease,\" he said. \"But younger people are more aware of the different harms alcohol can have on you.\" He added that while other generations think of alcohol issues as liver disease, which you get much later in life, younger people see the fuller picture of all the associated dangers - such as taking risks and acting impulsively.\n\nJessie said social media is a great way to hold herself accountable\n\nJessie's best advice for anyone wanting to go sober would be to \"de-clutter your social media\". \"Fill your feed up with people who inspire you. I still to this day, nearly two years on, take one day at a time,\" she said. \"That's why I still count how many days sober I am, because I don't know what's going to happen when I wake up tomorrow. \"But I do know I am going to wake up hangover-free.\"\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

London Zoo has asked for any sightings to be reported to them, adding the two blue and yellow-feathered birds were likely to stick together.\n\nThe macaws are \"ambassadors to their species\", London Zoo has said\n\nThis species of parrot was believed to be extinct until some were recognised in the Bolivian savannah in 1992.

    "A British businessman caught on camera confessing he was illegally selling luxury perfume to Russia is not facing criminal charges, the BBC has learned. David Crisp admitted to an undercover investigator that he had \u201cignored government edicts\u201d on sanctions by selling the \u00a31,000-a-bottle perfume in Russia. The BBC can now exclusively show the undercover video, which has previously only been shared in court. Mr Crisp was arrested in 2023 by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) - the UK government agency responsible for sanctions enforcement - but the investigation was dropped earlier this year. This is despite the discovery of evidence that he tried to conceal more than \u00a31.7m of illegal sales. Mr Crisp, from Surrey, denies knowingly breaching sanctions or concealing trades with Russia. There has not been a single UK criminal conviction for violating trade sanctions on Russia, the BBC understands, since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago. Failing to punish violators is \u201ca bad signal to send\u201d and makes the UK look like a \u201csoft touch,\u201d says senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who has been calling for tougher action against Russia.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Undercover filming: David Crisp tells a private investigator how he sells perfume to Russia\n\nMr Crisp travelled the world selling high-end perfume, regularly rubbing shoulders with celebrities and VIPs, who were unaware of his activities in Russia. But when he started chatting to a friendly American in the lift of a luxury hotel in Dallas in July last year, he had no idea he was actually speaking to a private investigator. Posing as a Las Vegas businessman, the agent said he was interested in stocking Mr Crisp\u2019s perfumes. They later met in Crisp\u2019s hotel room to smell the fragrances - where the investigator secretly filmed the conversation. \u201cHow\u2019s your Russian market?\u201d the investigator asked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Mr Crisp replied, \u201cWe\u2019re doing really well\u2026 we ignore government edicts.\u201d After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the UK government introduced sanctions banning trade with Russia in several areas - perfumes are specifically named. Breaching these regulations is a serious offence, with a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years. Following the introduction of sanctions, Mr Crisp had agreed with his then-business partner, David Garofalo, to cease trading with Russia. But Mr Garofalo later became suspicious after a whistleblower claimed that Crisp continued to sell perfume in Moscow. Mr Garofalo then hired the private investigators. The undercover footage is \u201csickening\u201d David Garofalo told me as we watch the footage together, adding \u201che knows that he\u2019s violating the sanctions\u201d.\n\nDavid Garofalo halted all sales to Russia once he took full control of the company\n\nWithout Mr Crisp\u2019s knowledge, the company also compiled a dossier of evidence that he had knowingly violated sanctions. Staff also found pallets of goods in the company\u2019s UK facility with paperwork showing recipients in Russia, and international shipping data confirming deliveries. Products were discovered on sale in Moscow that the company had only launched after the imposition of sanctions. \u201cHe had actually gone out of his way to disguise the fact that he\u2019d continued selling to Russia,\u201d Mr Garofalo told us. \u201cHe had deceived our in-house lawyer and misled our auditors.\u201d Mr Garofalo reported Mr Crisp to HMRC and it opened a criminal investigation. At the same time, Mr Garofalo pursued a civil case against his partner to remove him from the company. In July this year, a High Court judge granted a rare provisional injunction, meaning Mr Crisp would be removed immediately pending the full civil trial. In his ruling, the judge said the undercover video was \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that Mr Crisp knew he was breaching sanctions and the company accounts showed he \u201cconcealed the Russian trading\u201d. After taking full control of the company, Mr Garofalo immediately halted all sales to Russia. In a statement, David Crisp told the BBC: \u201cI strongly refute the allegations made against me by Mr Garofalo, at no point did I knowingly trade in breach of Russian sanctions\u2026 at no point did I attempt to conceal those trades\u2026 the companies' trades with Russia were well known to those within the business\u2026 I look forward to being fully exonerated.\u201d\n\nHMRC officers arrested Mr Crisp upon arrival at Gatwick Airport in October 2023 and seized his passport. But, by July this year, HMRC had dropped its investigation and told Mr Crisp that it would take no further action against him, returning his passport. Mr Garofalo told us he was shocked HMRC had showed no interest in the evidence he had collected. \u201cIt was an open and shut case. The evidence was just irrefutable.\u201d HMRC does not comment on individual cases, but it told the BBC that failure to comply with sanctions is a serious offence, and those who breach them could face enforcement actions including financial penalties or referral for criminal prosecution. Its statement added: \u201cHMRC has fined five companies for breaches of the Russia sanctions regulations in the last two years, including a \u00a31m fine issued in August 2023.\u201d But the BBC understands there haven\u2019t been any criminal prosecutions for violating trade sanctions on Russia since February 2022.\n\nTim Ash says the \u201callure of doing business with Russia... is too much for some people\u201d\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith MP, the chair of a committee of MPs working on sanctions against Russia, told the BBC the Crisp case isn\u2019t a \u201cone-off\u201d. \u201cIn terms of prosecution and seriously pursuing people over sanctions, the UK is very poor indeed,\u201d said Sir Iain. \u201cIf we don't prosecute, who the hell is deterred from breaching sanctions? He said other countries including the US, were \u201clight years\u201d ahead of the UK in terms of prosecuting violators. \u201cThere needs to be arrest, prosecution and incarceration. And if we don't do that, then there's no such thing as sanctions.\u201d The former Conservative Party leader said that HMRC often reached settlements, instead of issuing large fines or criminal convictions. \u201cThe authorities may say the sanctions breaches are too small to prosecute, but the answer is you prosecute the small ones, because the big ones need to know that you're coming after them as well,\u201d he added. The UK government had hoped sanctions would be a deterrent, without the need for robust enforcement, according to Tim Ash from the foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe reality is, the allure of doing business with Russia, the huge profits to be made, are too much for some people,\u201d explained Mr Ash. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in their bottom line, as opposed to the bottomless pit of Ukrainians dying.\u201d He said cases like Mr Crisp\u2019s sent a clear message that there would be no consequences for continuing business with Russia. \u201cWe are almost three years into the [full-scale] invasion, and the fact that we haven't got our sanctions regime together is pretty extraordinary.\u201d",
    "Spacecraft launches towards asteroid knocked off course by Nasa\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA spacecraft is on its way to visit an asteroid that US space agency Nasa knocked off course in 2022. The Hera craft launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 10:52 local time (15:52BST) on Monday. It is part of an international mission to see if we can stop dangerous asteroids hitting Earth. The project will look at what happened to a space rock called Dimorphos when Nasa intentionally collided with it.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Hera will reach Dimorphos, around seven million miles away, in December 2026. The Hera mission, which is run by the European Space Agency, is a follow-on from Nasa\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) project. Dimorphos is a small moon 160m-wide that orbits an asteroid close to Earth called Didymos in something called a binary asteroid system. In 2022 Nasa said it successfully changed Dimorphos\u2019s course by crashing a probe into it. It altered the rock\u2019s path by a few metres, according to Nasa\u2019s scientists. The asteroid was not on course to hit Earth, but it was a test to see whether space agencies could do it when there is genuine risk. When it arrives in two years, the Hera craft will look at the size and depth of the impact crater created on Dimorphos.\n\nTwo cube-shaped probes will also study the make-up of the asteroid and its mass. \u201cWe need to understand what are the physical properties of these asteroids? What are they made of? Are they blocks of rock? Are they made of sand inside?\u201d says Naomi Murdoch, a scientist involved with the European Space Agency mission. That should help scientists understand the best way to attempt to intercept other asteroids, which can be many different sizes and shapes, in the future. Scientists do not believe that we are currently at risk of a dinosaur-style extinction caused by an asteroid hitting Earth. An asteroid of that size could be easily spotted in space. The size of asteroid that DART and Hera are targeting are about 100-200m wide and are very difficult to see from our planet. From time to time they hit Earth. On 2013 a house-sized asteroid exploded in the sky above the town of Chelyabinsk in Russia. The shock wave blew out windows for over 200 square miles and damaged buildings. Over 1,600 people were injured in the blast. Scientists hope to one day be able to identify asteroids like this and knock them off course. \u201cIt's not to avoid an extinction of the human race. It's to create a system to minimize the damage as much as we can. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, but we do,\u201d says Prof Murdoch. But scientists warn that even though Nasa has proved it is possible to alter one asteroid\u2019s course, it does not mean it can easily be done on all space rocks. Intercepting an asteroid before it hits Earth also relies on being able to spot the incoming hazard in the first place.\n\nThe Hera craft will take two years to reach the Dimorphos asteroid",

In mid Wales, Aberystwyth Royal Pier in Ceredigion attracts both amusement arcade enthusiasts and roosting starlings who draw crowds when they flock to create magnificent murmurations. In the north, visitors to Bangor Garth Pier are drawn to its art gallery, craft shops and tearoom. On a sunny day in October, angler Jay Lewis was enjoying the peaceful views over the Severn Estuary on Penarth Pier in the Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales.\n\nVisitors can enjoy the sunrise from Penarth's 117-year-old pier\n\nThe 55-year-old had travelled for close to an hour from his home in Pontypool, Torfaen, for the experience. \"I suffer with depression and it's the only thing that helps,\" he explained. \"It's just relaxing and you get plenty of time to think.\"\n\nUnder Penarth pier lies a beach which is popular with cold dippers\n\nJay, a member of Penarth Sea Angling Club, comes for the bass, cod, rays and eels, and also the social interaction. \"I enjoy people coming on to me to see what I\u2019ve been catching,\" he said. \"And it\u2019s easy fishing, you've got the toilets, you\u2019ve got the shops and the views are lovely.\" Penarth Pier, now 117 years old and instantly recognisable with its art deco styled pavilion building, permits fishing for nine months of the year.\n\nPenarth pier is one of John Atkinson's favourite spots to fish\n\nJohn Atkinson, 69, from nearby Llandough, has been angling for 45 years and the pier is his regular spot. \"It takes your mind away from other things. You can just concentrate on the fishing and it takes away all your problems,\" he said. \"You strike up friendships with people where you\u2019ve got something in common. \"I\u2019ve met people from America, Canada, Australia, all over - tourists ask you what you're catching and you strike up conversation.\"\n\nWales' longest pier is in the coastal resort of Llandudno\n\nAlmost 200 miles (321 km) north of Penarth is Wales\u2019 longest pier - Llandudno in the county of Conwy. Originally 242 ft (72m) long on its opening day in 1858, it was extended in 1877 and now stands at 2,295ft (700m).\n\nThe Grade II-listed structure won the National Piers Society, external pier of the year award in 2005. Earlier this year, it was announced its fishing platform would be closed off for the foreseeable future following a number of incidents.\n\n\"The frequency in verbal abuse we\u2019re receiving and constant damage to the gate is relentless,\" its general manager posted on social media, external. \"We wanted everyone to enjoy themselves and unfortunately the minority has ruined it for others.\"\n\nThe town made the headlines during the Covid pandemic when a herd of about 122 Kashmiri goats ventured from the Great Orme and took over the deserted town centre, eating hedges and flowers from gardens. A line of Llandudno goats merchandise, including t-shirts and tote bags, quickly followed and has since raised thousands for the town's hospice. Visitors to New Quay's pier in Ceredigion, mid Wales, can encounter an altogether different wildlife experience.\n\nCardigan Bay is home to about 200 dolphins\n\nMarine life-spotting trips leave from the pier and head into Cardigan Bay, which is home to about 200 dolphins, the only semi-resident population of bottlenose dolphins in Wales, and the largest in the UK. The bay is also home to harbour porpoise, Atlantic grey seals and a variety of bird life including razorbills and guillemots. The stone pier was built in the 1830s and remains essential to industry in the seaside town.\n\nBoat-trippers can also spot seals from Cardigan Bay\n\n\"It is the main focus of the town,\" said skipper Jonathan Evans, who spends his days collecting visitors off the pier before dazzling them with the area's wildlife from his boat the Suncatcher. After spending 19 years as a photographer in London he decided to move home to Wales to help his dad with family business. \u201cWe are privileged to have wild dolphins here and that never gets old, every single day you see wild dolphins and its exciting,\" he said.\n\nJonathan Evans spends his days introducing visitors to the wildlife of Cardigan Bay\n\nSuncatcher crew member Lauren Walthour, who has a degree in Marine Biology, said the structure of the pier created the perfect conditions for dolphins to feed. \"The pier juts out to sea and so when the tides come in and out it forces the fish around the very tip of it, kind of trapping them, and these dolphins will use those tides to get some easy pickings for a meal,\" she said.\n\nNew Quay's stone pier was built in the 1830\n\nShe said it made the pier a \"dolphin hot spot\". She said as Cardigan Bay was shallow, being about 60m at its deepest, it meant the dolphins had no predators, such as orcas or sharks. \"So these dolphins are top of the food chain and the apex predator so this is a really safe, shallow protected nursery for these mothers to raise their calves and that's why their population is currently thriving so well,\" she added.\n\nLauren Walthour is passionate about teaching the public about marine life\n\nShe said everyone who visited was enamoured by the dolphins. \"They are just very charismatic, very playful, very social, very curious and very intelligent and that's why people love them,\" she said. \"Any encounter with them, whether its short or long, is always incredible.\"",
    "Dame Sally Davies said she had worried about someone picking up Novichok from the moment she knew \"Russian agents had been involved\" in the incident\n\nThe former chief medical officer for England said she had experienced nightmares about someone picking up discarded nerve agent after the poisoning of a former spy. Sergei Skirpal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by Novichok in Salisbury in March 2018. The attempted murders were followed by the death of Dawn Sturgess, 44, in July of that year, after she was exposed to the chemical weapon which was left in a discarded perfume bottle. The inquiry into Ms Sturgess' death heard how Dame Sally Davies had worried about someone picking up Novichok from the moment she knew \"Russian agents had been involved\" in the incident.\n\nDawn Sturgess died after being exposed to Novichok in July 2018\n\nIn her witness statement, read to the inquiry by Francesca Whitelaw KC, Dame Sally said she had been concerned \"about the disposal by the foreign agents of any residual nerve agent\". She also said she had raised her concern during at least one meeting, before becoming reassured that the police were hunting for a discarded vial, including by the river in Salisbury, and by the Environment Agency, who would \"monitor the unusual numbers of dead fish appearing in the river\". \u201cThis led to me later saying publicly that no one should pick anything up which they had not dropped,\" she added. Dame Sally said she had later attended a meeting where concerns about the statement and whether it would \"panic the public\" were raised.\n\nShe said the discussion had ended with the agreement that she was independent and experienced and could say what she felt mattered, but she added the only record of her making this statement is her own statement in September when she referred to advice she gave in March. However, the counsel for Ms Sturgess' family, Jesse Nicholls, said Dame Sally had said she had given the advice publicly, \u201cbecause that obviously should have happened but it didn\u2019t\u201d. She replied: \u201cNo, you are trying to suggest there was a cover-up, there was no cover-up.\u201d The inquiry also discussed a letter, dated 16 March, from Dame Sally to Sir Jeremy Heywood which said that on March 7, at the request of No 10 and the Metropolitan Police, she had issued a statement alongside Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley announcing the risk to public health as a result of the incident was \u201clow, based on the current evidence available\u201d.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

Last month, Khao Kheow Open Zoo had to warn visitors not to try to wake up Moo Deng, after the hippo soared in popularity and sparked a surge in visitors to the zoo.",
    "United by loyalty, Trump's new team have competing agendas\n\nIf personnel really does amount to policy, then we\u2019ve learned a lot this week about how Donald Trump intends to govern in his second term. More than a dozen major appointments, some of which will require Senate approval, offer a clearer picture of the team entrusted to drive his agenda as he returns to the White House. On the outside they appear united by one thing - loyalty to the top man. But beneath the surface, there are competing agendas. Here are four factions that reveal both Trump\u2019s ambition and potential tricky tests ahead for his leadership.\n\nTheir agenda: This trio have been among the most vocal politicians actively opposing US policies, particularly under President Biden. Choosing Gaetz as his attorney general nominee is possibly Trump\u2019s most controversial pick. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. A graduate of William and Mary Law School, he led the removal of California congressman Kevin McCarthy as the sitting Speaker of the House in October 2023. He has come under investigation by a House ethics committee for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl, using illegal drugs and misusing campaign funds. He denies wrongdoing and no criminal charges have been filed.\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week Tulsi Gabbard, picked to be Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, is a military veteran who served with a medical unit in Iraq. She is a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who switched parties to support Trump. Gabbard has routinely opposed American foreign policy, blaming Nato for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 then casting doubt on US intelligence assessments blaming Assad for using chemical weapons. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee health, is a longtime lawyer and environmentalist. He also spread fringe theories \u2013 about vaccines and the effects of 5G phone signals.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A look at Trump's cabinet and key roles... in 74 seconds\n\nWhat this tells us: Like Trump, Gaetz, Gabbard and Kennedy are aggressive challengers of the status quo. All three frequently tip over into conspiracy. They may be among the most determined supporters of Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d. The president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health. But bomb-throwers can also make unruly subordinates. Kennedy wants stricter regulation across food and farming industries, which may collide with Trump\u2019s government-slashing agenda. Gaetz\u2019s views on some issues - he favours legalisation of marijuana - are outside the Republican mainstream. And Gabbard, a fierce critic of American power, will be working for a president who is not afraid to use it - for instance, against Iran.\n\u2022 None What RFK could do on vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nTheir agenda: The three hardliners tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s border and immigration policies have vowed to strengthen security and clamp down on undocumented immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. Domestically, they - and the wider incoming Trump administration - have called for a drastic uptick in deportations, beginning with those considered national security or public safety threats, and a return to workplace \u201cenforcement operations\u201d that were paused by the Biden administration.\n\nWhat it tells us: Aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with Mexico were primary concerns for many voters. The possibility of increased deportations and workplace raids, however, could put Trump on a collision course with Democratic-leaning states and jurisdictions that may decide to push back or not co-operate. Some Republican states - whose economies rely, in part, on immigrant labour - may also object.\n\nTheir agenda: Trump has named the world\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk, to lead a cost-cutting effort dubbed the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d. He will share the role with 39-year-old investor-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy, who became an ardent Trump backer after bowing out as a candidate in the Republican primary. The two men are among the loudest and flashiest tech bros, a group that swung towards Trump this year, seeking a champion to disavow \u201cwoke\u201d political correctness and embrace a libertarian vision of small government, low taxes and light regulation. Musk has floated a possible $2tn in spending cuts, vowing to send \u201cshockwaves\u201d through the government. Ramaswamy, who has backed eliminating the tax-collecting agency, the IRS, and the Department of Education, among others, wrote after the announcement: \u201cShut it down.\u201d\n\nWhat it tells us: The appointments are an acknowledgment of the help Trump got on the campaign trail from Ramaswamy and Musk, the latter of whom personally ploughed more than $100m into the campaign. But time will tell what power this faction goes on to have. Despite its name, the department is not an official agency. The commission will stand outside the government to advise on spending, which is partly controlled by Congress. Trump, who ran up budget deficits during his first term, has shown little commitment to cutting spending. He has promised to leave Social Security and Medicare - two of the biggest areas of government spending - untouched, which could make cost-cutting difficult. RFK Jr\u2019s pledge to increase regulation of food additives and ultra-processed foods could also clash with Musk and Ramaswamy\u2019s mandate to cut red tape.\n\nTheir agenda: These men will run Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. They are all hawks on China. Rubio, nominee for secretary of state, is among Beijing\u2019s harshest critics, having argued for travel bans on some Chinese officials and for the closure of Hong Kong\u2019s US trade offices. The three are likely to push through Trump\u2019s pledge for much higher tariffs on Chinese imports. They see Beijing as the top economic and security threat to the US. Waltz - picked for national security adviser - has said the US is in a \u201cCold War\u201d with the ruling communist party. Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director who served as an intelligence chief in his first term, has likened countering China\u2019s rise to the defeat of fascism or bringing down the Iron Curtain.\n\nWhat it tells us: While Trump often signals his own hawkish economic views on China, he has also vacillated - which could spark tensions with his top foreign policy team. In his first term, Trump triggered a trade war with Beijing (attempts to de-escalate this failed amid the pandemic) and relations slumped further when he labelled Covid the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d. But he also heaped praise on President Xi Jinping as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader ruling with an \u201ciron fist\u201d. This unpredictability could make managing America\u2019s most consequential strategic relationship even harder. Rubio might also clash with Gabbard, Trump\u2019s pick for director of intelligence, who previously criticised him on foreign policy, saying he \"represents the neocon, warmongering establishment\".",
    "Two months ago, few outside Minnesota knew Tim Walz. But now the state\u2019s governor is six weeks away from possibly becoming vice-president. What do we know about him?\n\nWalz, 60, taught geography at Mankato West High School in Minnesota and led the school to its first American football state championship. Some of his former players lined up on stage at the Democratic National Convention in August to sing the praises of their former coach. \u201cHe believed in us,\u201d said one.\n\nHe came out of nowhere to be picked as running mate for Harris Few people were talking about the governor of Minnesota as the possible vice-president pick for Kamala Harris in her run for the White House. But some impressive TV performances - including one where he described some Republican policies as \u201cweird\u201d - catapulted him into contention. With a love of hunting and ice fishing, he was seen as representing rural America in a way that Harris, the prosecutor from San Francisco, never could.\n\nHe once taught in China After obtaining his teaching degree, he started a one-year post in China two months after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when the authorities crushed a mass protest. In the vice-presidential debate, he said he had \u201cmisspoken\u201d in the past by saying he was in Hong Kong at the time of the protest. \u201cI\u2019m a knucklehead,\u201d he told the TV audience.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 at the urging of his father who died of lung cancer two years later. He served in the volunteer force for 24 years.\n\nAs governor he became known for free school lunches During the Covid pandemic, access to free school meals was expanded nationwide. After that elapsed, Walz signed a Minnesota state law in 2023 that gave all children access to breakfast and lunch. It became one of his signature, most talked-about achievements.\n\nHe has had to clarify other misleading statements Walz was never deployed to a combat zone and had to correct a speech which resurfaced in recent weeks in which he implied he had. He was also criticised for misstating his rank at retirement. Then he had to clarify what kind of assistance he and his wife Gwen received to help them conceive, to dispel the impression they received IVF.\n\nHis interactions with his daughter are big on TikTok The happy outcome of that difficult fertility journey was their eldest child Hope, now 23. She and her father appear in several widely shared, light-hearted videos that make fun of the generation gap.\n\nHis speech at the Democratic convention was folksy He introduced himself to a national audience in Chicago with Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder in the audience. Teed up by John Mellencamp\u2019s Small Town, he began by emphasising his community values and went on to champion reproductive rights and praise Harris as a tough and experienced leader. Leaning heavily on football metaphors, he finished with: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna leave it all on the field.\u201d\n\nHis son Gus also made headlines that day His children, Hope and Gus, were in tears as he addressed them by name, saying: \u201cYou are my entire world.\u201d Walz\u2019s 17-year-old son could be seen saying \u201cthat\u2019s my dad\u201d, a moment that went viral.\n\nHe faced Republican JD Vance in the VP debate The televised showdown between two Midwesterners was a mostly polite affair in contrast to the presidential candidates a month ago. After a faltering start, Walz had some good moments, notably on teenagers and guns, abortion and the uprising by Trump supporters on 6 January.",
    "Gudjohnsens back at Stamford Bridge and ready to beat Chelsea\n\nEidur Gudjohnsen with son Andri, who faces Chelsea on Thursday\n\nThere are images of a four-year-old Andri Gudjohnsen celebrating the 2005 Premier League title win with his father on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. Now 22 and returning as a striker for KAA Gent, the Iceland international will on Thursday play at the 40,000-seater capacity stadium where his father made history. \"It's quite typical, wasn't it, to get Chelsea in the draw?\" he says. The Gudjohnsen name is legendary around Stamford Bridge as Eidur helped secure the club's first title in 50 years under Jose Mourinho, which helped kickstart the Roman Abramovich era. \"I remember glimpses of those victories,\" Andri adds as he also returns to the city where he was born. He added: \"The first thing I did was call my father. He already knew. It's special for me and for him. I was born when my father played there; it's kind of a unique draw.\" Of course, not only are Chelsea part of the Gudjohnsen family history, but they are the highest-ranked team in the Conference League and will be a huge test for a developing football talent in the Belgian league.\n\nThe Gudjohnsens have all been forwards, inspired by the goalscoring feats of the previous generation.\n\u2022 None Arnor: The grandfather, regarded as a legend at Anderlecht.\n\u2022 None Eidur: Iceland\u2019s most famous and successful player, now watching his sons with pride.\n\u2022 None Sveinn: Eldest son, playing in Norway with Sarpsborg in a career spanning six countries.\n\u2022 None Andri: Middle son - a striker who signed for Gent this season. Andri continues, refering to his grandfather's spell at Anderlecht and his dad's at Club Brugge: \"It's just strange, really, that three generations of a Gudjohnsen player also end up here in the Belgian League and in one of the big teams. \"I wanted to be a goalkeeper when I was younger, but I think seeing my dad score a lot of goals throughout his career probably just inspired us boys. \"We want to score also, and to be kind of the main man up front, the one who scores all the goals. So yeah, it's probably just something that was passed on down the generations.\" Eidur came on for his father when making his international debut. He was also assistant manager when Sveinn set up a goal for Andri in 2021, but being from a footballing family has its pitfalls. \"My father, for example, in Iceland, could barely go out on to the streets without people asking for pictures and signatures, and also in Chelsea and Barcelona. But at the end of the day he was just my dad to me. It's just something that you grow up with. \"My oldest brother perhaps took the biggest hits when it came to being compared to our father since he was the first born. \"You kind of get used to it, and you learn how to deal with it.\" Talking about his father's influence, Andri adds: \"He's found a kind of good balance between not being too critical or too involved in our business when it comes to football, but also being there for us when we need support or his advice.\"\n\nRemarkably, Andri was educated in both the Barcelona and Real Madrid academies during his youth career, never training at Chelsea despite interest from English clubs. It meant training under Madrid's legendary striker Raul in the B team and getting to meet Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Xavi and Andres Iniesta while his father was at Camp Nou. The middle Gudjohnsen son had a turbulent summer as Danish club Lyngby triggered his release clause after a successful loan spell from IFK Norrkoping, before Gent swooped in to sign him less than two months later, which represents an important step in his footballing development. Gent have lost only three of their 15 games this season in all competitions and are also one of the strongest teams in this competition. \u201cThis is a game that any footballer wants to play,\" Andri says. \"We're all excited and we go there with the mindset of taking something out of it. \"We have high expectations this season. We're putting together a young squad full of potential. \"We want to go as far as we possibly can, both in the league and in the Conference League. \"I think we have the quality, the players and the will to do very good things this season.\"",

    "New allegations over surgeon convicted of rape\n\nSalil Korambayil was jailed in 2023 for 14 years for raping two women and in August he was given a further 12 months for the misuse of patient data\n\nMore women have come forward with allegations about a trainee surgeon who was convicted of raping two women in Devon and Cornwall. Salil Korambayil, 33, was jailed in 2023 for 14 years for raping two women and in August he was given a further 12 months for the misuse of patient data. The new allegations made to the BBC include one of rape and one from a woman who says he accessed her medical records and later turned up at her house. The claims have been put to Korambayil\u2019s legal team, but they have not responded.\n\nEmma, which is not her real name, told the BBC the surgeon was a \"predator\" who had stolen everything from her, but she had been afraid no-one would believe her because of what he did for a job. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. Korambayil first made contact with her when he added her as a friend on Facebook in July 2020. Emma said: \"I messaged him and said: 'Have you added me by mistake?' \"He said he thought he recognised me from the hospital. \"I thought he was probably genuine and then when I found out what he did for a living, very quickly I suppose, I thought he was trustworthy because of what he did.\" At the time Korambayil was working at the North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple.\n\nAfter exchanging messages, Emma said they went on several dates before he invited her to his bedsit. Emma said: \"We started kissing and had consensual sex but during that he had his hands around my throat which I was uncomfortable with as I couldn't breathe properly.\" She said she tried to roll away but could not and he raped her. Emma said she reported it to police at a later date but she was too traumatised to take it further. \"It's taken years for me to piece back who I was before,\" Emma said. \"But I want it public so that other women can come forward if they\u2019ve been in the same position as me, because I think there are others out there.\"\n\nIn 2021, Emma received a letter from the NHS saying her medical records had been unlawfully accessed by an unnamed doctor. A second letter, sent after the surgeon had been jailed, revealed it had been Korambayil. Another woman spoke to the BBC about Korambayil after finding out her medical records had also been accessed without authorisation.\n\nStacey told the BBC she had received letters from the NHS saying her medical records had been accessed by a doctor without authorisation\n\nStacey Loder said Korambayil first contacted her on Facebook in 2020 saying she had come up as a suggested friend and he thought he recognised her from the hospital. He also told her he was a surgeon. Later she was in the North Devon District Hospital to have her appendix out and Korambayil was the surgeon. Stacey told the BBC she raised concerns to the hospital but she has since been told they could not find any record of her complaint. When she returned home she said she received a Facebook message from Korambayil. \"I went home and we messaged that evening,\" she said. \"He made a comment about the operation, saying maybe wait a couple of weeks before I make it up to him for operating on me.\"\n\nStacey said at first she engaged in the messages, but when they became more explicit she stopped replying. She alleges that after she ignored him he turned up at her house, but she did not let him in and told the BBC she had never disclosed her address to him despite him \"asking four times\". Stacey said she \"felt sick\" looking back at the situation. \"He is a surgeon, he knew how vulnerable I was and he just didn\u2019t care.\" Stacey told the BBC she had received letters from the NHS saying her medical records had been accessed by a doctor without authorisation. She said the hospital later confirmed it was Korambayil who had unlawfully accessed her records on two occasions after her surgery. She believes this is how he got her address.\n\nThe Royal Devon University Healthcare Trust said it could not comment on individual cases but had contacted people whose data was accessed \"to provide support\u2026 to patients who wanted to raise any concerns\". It added: \"Our focus throughout has been on being open and transparent, and supporting the victims, both those we are aware of and any more that come to light.\" The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, where he later worked, has also contacted those affected and both hospitals said they were \"appalled\" by Korambayil\u2019s \"abuse\" of \"trust\". Korambayil has applied for leave to appeal the rape convictions.\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",

    "What RFK Jr could do on US vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has announced he wants to appoint vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as the head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The position has a broad remit across the US health industry, including food safety, pharmaceuticals, public health and vaccinations. If his post is confirmed by the US Senate, he would be in charge of key health agencies with about 80,000 employees and a trillion-dollar budget. RFK Jr has long expressed views that conflict with scientific evidence, especially on vaccines, and his nomination has provoked opposition from public health experts. But he has also adopted positions with popular support, scrutinising the use of food additives and urging that the power of big pharma be curbed. The nephew of President JFK, he ran for the White House himself as an independent but dropped out and backed Trump. As secretary, Kennedy would be in charge of huge agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This is where he stands on vaccines, food, fluoride and health agencies.\n\nThe vast majority of health experts champion inoculations for their long history of success - guarding against dangerous diseases and even eradicating deadly smallpox. But as founder of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, Kennedy has for nearly two decades been airing debunked claims about jabs. In recent years, he has gained prominence in the US for making the discredited claim that childhood immunisations are linked to autism. But he has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination and says he had his own children immunised. Kennedy has said that if he were to join the Trump administration, he would want to examine government vaccine safety data and share his findings with the public. He recently denied that he would block or ban vaccinations, however. \"If vaccines are working for somebody, I\u2019m not going to take them away. People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,\" he told NBC News last week. The stock prices of vaccine makers like Moderna, Pfizer and Merck fell after Trump announced his pick.\n\nAnnouncing Kennedy's nomination, Trump said Americans had for too long been \"crushed\" by food and drug companies engaging in \"deception, misinformation, and disinformation\". Kennedy has long blamed the food and drug industries - as well as the regulators who oversee them - for Americans' poor health. He has said that he wants to overhaul the systems that oversee pesticides, herbicides, food additives and pharmaceuticals. He has called for a ban on food dyes and additives, regularly citing Europe's regulatory standards. \"We have 1,000 ingredients in our food that are illegal in Europe that are illegal in other countries and they're making our kids sick,\" he alleged in an NBC News interview. \"They're there because of corruption in our agencies.\" An FDA spokesperson told the BBC that it is necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing estimates of authorised chemicals between the US and Europe. Both \"generally apply the same fundamental scientific approach to safety assessment when evaluating the safety of chemicals in food\", according to the FDA spokesperson. \"Different regulatory definitions and different methodologies can influence the results. Without clarity, comparisons can be misleading,\" the official added. Last month Kennedy accused the FDA on X, external of suppressing the use of \"psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented\". He said that those who were \"part of this corrupt system\" should be prepared to \"pack your bags\". Both ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were held up as miracle cures for Covid but such claims have not been supported by science.\n\u2022 None What do we know about Covid and hydroxychloroquine\n\nKennedy recently vowed to remove fluoride - a cavity-fighting mineral - from the US drinking water, which about two-thirds of Americans have in their water supply. Though it is a decision made by state and local health authorities, Kennedy said on X earlier this month that \"the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water\". He alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists \"is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease\".\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week The US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health. Recent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products. Most of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water. Removing it altogether could still pose a challenge, however, as the federal government does not have the final authority over that decision.\n\nKennedy has long claimed that chronic health issues have worsened due to the inaction of federal health agencies. He said at a rally in Arizona earlier this month that he plans to fire and replace 600 employees at the NIH - which oversees vaccine research - as soon as Trump takes the White House. The longtime lawyer also said last month that he intends \"to have every nutritional scientist\" in the health and agriculture departments fired on day one of a Trump presidency because he alleges they are co-opted by corporate interests. He reportedly intends to take a serious look at those who work at other health agencies as well, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "LinkedIn: We're too boring for kids for social media ban\n\nCareer-networking site LinkedIn has told Australian lawmakers it is too dull for kids to warrant its inclusion in a proposed ban on social media for under 16 year olds. \"LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors,\" the Microsoft-owned company said in a submission to an Australian senate committee. The Australian government has said it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to stop children accessing social media platforms. But companies behind some of the most popular platforms with young people - Meta, Google, Snapchat-owner Snap Inc and TikTok - have all challenged the planned law in submissions made to lawmakers.\n\u2022 None Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the proposed law is to address the harm social media was inflicting on Australian children. He said it was for \"the mums and dads\" who like him were \"worried sick about the safety of our kids online.\" Other countries are closely watching what happens with the legislation with some - including the UK - saying they are open to following suit. Australia's Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee gave respondents one day to comment on the bill, which would amend its existing Online Safety Act. Its report to the Senate, external concludes the bill should pass - providing its recommendations, such as engaging young people in the legislation's implementation, are considered.\n\nHowever, in their responses, the world's biggest tech firms have been setting out why they are unhappy with the proposed law. Google - which owns YouTube - and Instagram-parent Meta have said they needed more time to consider the legislation. Meta said its current form \"will fail to achieve its goal of reducing the burden on parents to manage the safety of young people on social media\". It also claimed it \"ignores the evidence\" presented by child safety and mental health experts - a view shared by Snapchat in its own submission. X (formerly Twitter), meanwhile questioned the legality of the bill's proposals. TikTok Australia said it had \"significant concerns\" with the bill as proposed. Like other platforms commenting on the legislation, it said it \"hinges\" on an ongoing age assurance trial looking at technologies that can effectively check user age. Ella Woods-Joyce, director of public policy for TikTok Australia and New Zealand, wrote in the company's submission that the bill's \"rushed passage poses a serious risk of further unintended consequences\". But LinkedIn has adopted a different approach - arguing in its submission that is a platform which is simply not of any interest to children. Its minimum age requirement of 16 means they cannot access it, the company said, adding it removes child accounts when found. If LinkedIn can successfully argue it should not be included in the legislation it will potentially avoid the cost and disruption involved it introducing additional age verification processes to the site. \"Subjecting LinkedIn\u2019s platform to regulation under the proposed legislation would create unnecessary barriers and costs for LinkedIn\u2019s members in Australia to undertake age assurance,\" it said.\n\nThe Australian government has said it wants to bring in the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year. But experts have said the bill's timeframe and current composition fails to provide an opportunity for adequate scrutiny. Carly Kind, the country's privacy commissioner, said in a LinkedIn post, external on Monday after appearing at a public Senate hearing that she was concerned by \"the widespread privacy implications of a social media ban\". Human rights commissioner Lorraine Findlay called the one-day window for submissions of responses to the legislation \"entirely inadequate\" in a LinkedIn post on Thursday, external. \"We need actual consultation, not just the appearance of it,\" she said. Nonetheless, the Australian government's plans have sparked interest elsewhere. In the UK, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, told the BBC this month that similar legislation was \"on the table.\" France has already introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent- though research indicates almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.",
    "Is this the final chapter of the Sue Gray saga?\n\nFive weeks after Sue Gray resigned as the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, with the prospect of her being sacked hovering close, she is off again. And just like last time, even the manner of her departure is contested. We have been told the prime minister had decided to withdraw the offer for Ms Gray to be his envoy to the nations and regions. And, we understand, the cabinet secretary, the most senior civil servant in the country, had spoken to her to confirm this. This chain of events is not disputed by other figures in government. But Ms Gray is adamant it was her decision, we are told, and she never spoke directly to the prime minister about it. A friend of Ms Gray told the BBC: \"Sue has taken a decision not to take the role. She\u2019s going to focus on other things.\" They added: \"She\u2019s taken time to think about it properly, talking to stakeholders, but ultimately she\u2019s decided she doesn\u2019t want to do it.\" It appears the prime minister had grown tired of Ms Gray\u2019s failure to actually start the paid, part-time job that she had been demoted into when she left Downing Street. Given 38 days had gone by since it was publicly known she had been offered the new role, it had been clear for some time that she didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nIt seems reasonable to conclude, at the very least, that both sides were having second thoughts. It also seems reasonable to say that a second bout of messy and not entirely consistent briefing from each camp underlines the central truth in all of this - the hurt, the rows, the anger, the mistrust which has been there for all to see. Her apparent lack of enthusiasm was almost immediately evident, when she failed to turn up at the first ever meeting of a new Council of the Nations and Regions in Edinburgh just days into the job. What followed were daily questions to the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman from reporters about whether she had taken up her post. After weeks of stonewalling, an answer: no. One insider got in touch about the envoy role and said: \"We all thought it was a bad idea that would lead to endless drama and probably another resignation down the line.\" In other words, what might have seemed like a mutually convenient layby into which Ms Gray could be shunted, ended up perpetuating a rather public soap opera. Some sceptics had seen the new gig as a non-job from the start. The government saying it isn\u2019t looking to fill the vacancy will do little to dispel that instinct from those who thought it all along. The Scottish National Party MP Pete Wishart mocked the news, telling the Commons: \"We got the crushing news today that our British envoy to Scotland will no longer be coming there to represent this Parliament.\" \"We were practising the street parties and the haka just to be sure that she was properly welcome to the northern territories,\" he added. So, what might happen next? Some have pondered that Ms Gray may be offered a seat in the House of Lords \u2013 but would that revive all of these issues again? Incidentally, beyond all the noise about Ms Gray it is worth reflecting on other more recent changes in Downing Street \u2013 both in personnel and managerial instinct. Two Blair-era Labour advisers are returning to the heart of government in senior roles \u2013 Jonathan Powell as national security adviser and Liz Lloyd as director of policy delivery and innovation. This reconfiguration coincides with Sir Keir Starmer coming to a view four-and-a-half months into the job as prime minister that it isn\u2019t sufficient for No 10 to merely empower government departments to crack on with their work. They need \"a strong team captain\", as one source put it. \"This is the broader part of the post-Sue reset,\" the source added, saying it amounted to a \"significant reassessment\" in how Sir Keir wanted to approach a job he has been learning how best to grapple with. Ms Gray has been a case study in the early difficulties of that grappling, which Downing Street might now finally hope to have put behind it.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Flames rise from a residential building in Russia after a drone attack from Ukraine\n\nRussia and Ukraine have carried out their largest drone attacks against each other since the start of the war. Russia's defence ministry said it intercepted 84 Ukrainian drones over six regions, including some approaching Moscow, which forced flights to be diverted from three of the capital's major airports. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 145 drones towards every part of the country on Saturday night, with most shot down. The barrages come amid expectations that US president-elect Donald Trump may put pressure on both sides to end the conflict.\n\nUkraine's attempted strike on Moscow was also its biggest attack on the capital since the war began, and was described as \"massive\" by the region's governor. Most of the drones were downed in the Ramenskoye, Kolomna and Domodedovo districts, officials said. In Ramenskoye, south-west of Moscow, five people were injured and four houses caught fire due to falling debris, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. It added that 34 drones had been shot down over the town. In September, a woman was killed in a drone attack that hit Ramenskoye. In May last year, two drones were destroyed near the Kremlin in central Moscow and there were several drone attacks on the Moscow City business district. In Ukraine, at least two people were injured after a drone hit the Odesa region. Images showed flames rising from some buildings, as well as aftermath damage. The Ukrainian air force said 62 of Russia's Iranian-made drones were shot down, while 67 were \"lost\". A further 10 left Ukraine's airspace heading back towards Russia, as well as neighbouring Belarus and Moldova, it added. Further strikes were reported overnight into Monday, with Russia saying it had destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones near the regions of Kursk and Belgorod. Meanwhile, five people were killed in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, following an air attack that left residential buildings on fire, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. He said a 45-year-old woman had also been injured and was in hospital.\n\nIt comes as Russian troops reportedly made their largest territorial gains in October since March 2022, according to analysis of Institute for the Study of War data by the AFP news agency. However, Sir Tony Radakin, the UK's chief of defence staff, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Russia had suffered its worst month for casualties since the start of the war. Russian forces suffered an average of about 1,500 dead and injured \"every single day\" in October, he said. There has been intense speculation about how Trump will approach the conflict since his election win in the US. The president-elect regularly said in his election campaign that he could end the war \"in a day\", but has not offered details on how he would do that. A former adviser to Trump, Bryan Lanza, told the BBC that the incoming administration would focus on achieving peace rather than enabling Ukraine to gain back territory from Russia. In response, a spokesperson for Trump distanced the president-elect from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza \"does not speak for him\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke via state media on Sunday of \"positive\" signals from the incoming US administration. He claimed that Trump spoke during his election campaign about wanting peace and not a desire to inflict defeat on Russia. Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky since his election win, a source telling the BBC that the conversation lasted \"about half an hour\". Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war. In his regular evening address to Ukrainians on Sunday, Zelensky said \"the only way to secure a lasting peace\" is for strength and diplomacy to work hand in hand.",

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Sunday, external for high winds gusting up to 70mph (113km/h) on coasts and hills in Cumbria, which began at 03:00 BST and will last until about midnight. A yellow rain warning was also in place across Devon and Cornwall until midday, with strong winds and heavy rain and Dartmoor among the worst affected areas. Meteorologists said Storm Ashley, the first named storm of the season, would see a rapid drop of pressure as it moves in from the Atlantic - a phenomenon called a \"weather bomb\".\n\nHigh tides, strong winds and large waves are expected to cause flooding on the Cumbrian coastline in the afternoon, the Environment Agency has warned, external. Flood gates have been closed Flimby and Maryport, with areas most at risk including Allonby, Maryport, Flimby, Workington, Parton and Whitehaven.\n\nThe strong winds, combined with high tides, could lead to dangerous conditions, including possible delays or cancellations to travel, the Met Office said. It warned of possible power cuts, minor damage to buildings and large coastal waves in Cumbria, bringing debris onto coastal roads and properties. The warning is for wind gusts of 50-60mph (80-97km/h) inland and 60-70mph (97-113km/h) on coasts and hills.\n\nIn the south west, the Met Office said bus and train services would likely be impacted, while disruption on the roads could increase journey times. Interruption to power supplies and other services was also likely. People have been advised people to check road conditions and amend travel plans if necessary, while also preparing for power cuts, with torches and batteries on standby.\n\nElectricity North West said it would \"monitor the network and ensure supplies and teams are available to respond if the storm causes damage to overhead lines\". Richard Moulton, incident manager for Electricity North West, said: \"The forecast is for extremely strong winds across Cumbria and surrounding areas.\" \"Our local teams are on standby and ready to respond quickly to support our customers,\" he added. Meanwhile, rail operator Northern urged customers to check their journey before travelling, external in the North West on Sunday. It said crew shortages and Storm Ashley would affect travel.",

    "Elsom played 75 matches for the Wallabies, which he captained\n\nAn international arrest warrant has been issued for Australian ex-rugby star Rocky Elsom following a conviction for embezzlement in France, French media say. The former captain of Australia's national team was president of RC Narbonne, one of country's most prestigious clubs, in 2015-16. On Friday a court found him guilty of misappropriating a total of \u20ac700,000 (\u00a3586,000). Elsom was convicted in absentia and given a five-year-prison sentence, according to French media. He recently told Sunday Times newspaper that he was living in the Irish capital Dublin.\n\nIn the interview with the British outlet, published on 6 October, Elsom said he was coaching at the Catholic University School, a private school for boys in Dublin. He said planned to live in the city until December. A sporting celebrity in Ireland, the 41-year-old, played for Leinster Rugby in the late 2000s and helped the team win the Heineken Cup, Europe's top club rugby tournament, in 2009. He also appeared 75 times for Australia's national team - nicknamed the Wallabies - between 2005 and 2011. After his retirement he was part of a consortium that bought RC Narbonne. The French court convicted Elsom of abusing corporate assets and forging documents during his time as president of the club, local media reports say. A lawyer involved in the case, Patrick Tabet, is quoted by Ouest-France newspaper as saying that Elsom made a \"completely unjustified\" payment of \u20ac79,000 to a former coach and gave a monthly salary of \u20ac7,200 to an Australian resident who \"never came to Narbonne\". The club was placed into administration and relegated to lower leagues in 2018. The judge handed down a harsher prison term than the two years requested by prosecutors. Mr Tabet said the former Wallabies star was also ordered to pay back some \u20ac705,000 (\u00a3586,000).",

    "Jon Boutcher says the fine is \u201cregrettable\u201d given the PSNI\u2019s budget problems\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said it is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d after failing to have a \u00a3750,000 fine reduced over last year\u2019s major data breach. It had made representations to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) who first announced the penalty in May. Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said the fine was \u201cregrettable\u201d given the PSNI\u2019s budget problems. The breach involved accidentally releasing some personal details on all 9,400 officers and staff in August last year. The UK's information commissioner has said it was the worst data breach his office has ever seen.\n\nThe surnames, initials, rank and roles of the personnel were released under a freedom of information (FoI) request and published online for several hours. The details were later obtained by dissident republicans. The ICO had previously stated the fine would have been \u00a35.6m had it not applied discretion. This allows for lower fines when public bodies are involved, given payment comes from the public purse. The \u00a3750,000 fine is the largest it has ever imposed on a public body in the UK.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the UK Information Commissioner John Edwards said: \"This is the worst data breach that we have seen.\" He said he believes accountability has been held after the PSNI data breach last year, even if no one loses their job. \"I don't agree that no one is being held accountable,\" he said. He said he had no intention of reducing the fine. He said it was \"impossible to imagine the fear and uncertainty this breach caused PSNI officers and staff\". \u201cA lack of simple internal administration procedures resulted in the personal details of an entire workforce, many of whom had made great sacrifices to conceal their employment, being exposed,\" he said. Whilst acknowledging the financial pressures facing the PSNI, he said \"my role as commissioner is to take action to protect people\u2019s information rights and this includes issuing proportionate, dissuasive fines\".\n\nThe PSNI set to be fined \u00a3750,000 amid budget problems\n\nMr Boutcher said the fine would \u201cfurther compound\u201d the PSNI\u2019s financial situation. It currently has a \u00a334m shortfall in its budget. \u201cAs a service we are in a different place today than we were last August and we have continued to work tirelessly to devalue the compromised dataset by introducing a number of measures for officers and staff,\" he said. \u201cWe have provided significant crime prevention advice to our officers and staff and their families via online tools, advice clinics and home visits.\u201d The Police Federation also expressed disappointment at the fine. \u201cA fine of this magnitude on an already cash-strapped PSNI will have a negative impact on the organisation,\" its chairman Liam Kelly said. \u201cWe would have preferred if PSNI could have been permitted to alternatively spend the funds on enhancing its data security and provide much needed reinvestment in community initiatives such as road safety and CCTV partnerships with councils.\u201d The PSNI is currently involved in settling a damages case brought by up to 7,000 of those impacted.",

    "Why fight for justice isn't over in India's 'horrific' widow-burning case, 37 years on\n\nRoop Kanwar was burned to death on her husband's funeral pyre\n\nIt was a case that made headlines globally and led to widespread condemnation. A teenaged widow was burned on her husband's funeral pyre under the Hindu practice of sati 37 years ago. Now Roop Kanwar\u2019s story has returned to headlines in India after a court acquitted eight men accused of glorifying her death, in the last of the remaining cases in the grisly saga. Sati was first banned in 1829 by the British colonial rulers, but the practice had continued even after India\u2019s independence in 1947. Kanwar is recognised as India\u2019s last sati. The outrage over her death forced the Indian government to introduce a tough new law \u2013 Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 \u2013 banning the practice and, for the first time, also its glorification. It mandated death or life term for those committing sati or abetting it. But over the years, everyone accused of involvement in Kanwar\u2019s death and the glorification that followed has been cleared by courts.\n\u2022 None This report contains some distressing details Last week\u2019s order has also led to outrage, with women\u2019s organisations and activists expressing concern that no-one has been held accountable over her death. Fourteen women\u2019s groups in Rajasthan have written a letter to Chief Minister Bhajan Lal asking him to ensure the government challenges the order in the high court and also makes all attempts to prevent glorification of sati. Coming after such a long delay, these acquittals could \u201creinforce a culture of sati glorification\u201d, they wrote. A lawyer acting for the eight accused told BBC Hindi that they were acquitted because \u201cno evidence was found against them\u201d. I asked Rajasthan\u2019s Justice Minister Jogaram Patel whether the government planned to appeal the decision. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet received a copy of the judgement. We will examine it on its merits and demerits and then decide whether to appeal or not,\u201d he told me. When asked about why the government hadn\u2019t appealed the earlier acquittals, he said those cases had happened before his time and he was not aware of the details.\n\nRoop Kanwar had been married for just seven months to Maal Singh when he died\n\nThe death of the 18-year-old in Deorala village on 4 September 1987 was a huge public spectacle. Watched by hundreds of villagers, it was described as a blot on Rajasthan and India. Her husband\u2019s family and others from their upper-caste Rajput community said Kanwar\u2019s decision had been in keeping with the tradition of sati and was voluntary. They said she had dressed up in her bridal finery and led a procession around the village streets, before climbing into the pyre of Maal Singh, her husband of seven months. She then placed his head in her lap and recited religious chants while slowly burning to death, they added. It was a claim contested by journalists, lawyers, civil society and women\u2019s rights activists \u2013 and initially, even by Kanwar\u2019s parents. They lived in the state capital, Jaipur, just two hours from the village, but learnt of their son-in-law\u2019s death and their daughter\u2019s immolation from the next day\u2019s newspaper. But they later said they believed their daughter\u2019s act had been voluntary. Critics said the retraction had come under pressure from powerful politicians who used the incident to mobilise the Rajput community for \u201cvote-bank politics\u201d.\n\nSome still visit the spot where Roop Kanwar died to light a lamp\n\nIn the days following Kanwar\u2019s death, both sides held high-decibel protests. The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with activists protesting for justice, criticism of the Congress-led state government, and a letter to the Rajasthan chief justice calling for a ban on celebrations. Despite the court ban, 200,000 people attended a ceremony 13 days after Kanwar\u2019s death, where framed photos and posters of her were sold, transforming, external Deorala into a profitable pilgrimage site. Shortly after, two separate reports concluded that Kanwar \u201cwas hounded by villagers to commit sati\u201d and her immolation was \u201cfar from voluntary\u201d. Journalist Geeta Seshu, who visited the village as part of a three-member team three weeks after the incident, told the BBC that \u201cthe situation on the ground was tense and fraught\u201d. \u201cThe Rajput Sabha had taken over the entire place and the atmosphere was very charged. The spot where Roop had died was surrounded by sword-wielding young men. They were going around it in circles and it was very difficult for us to speak to eyewitnesses.\u201d But the trio still managed to get some testimonies from villagers that went into Trial by Fire, external, their damning fact-finding report.\n\nWomen's organisations protested in Delhi and other cities against Kanwar's death\n\n\u201cPreparations for the sati began immediately after Maal Singh's body was brought to the village in the morning. Roop, who got an inkling of this, escaped from the house and hid in the nearby fields,\u201d they wrote. \u201cShe was found cowering in a barn and dragged to the house and put on the pyre. On her way, she is reported to have walked unsteadily surrounded by Rajput youths. She was also seen to have been frothing at the mouth\u201d - suggesting that she had been drugged. \u201cShe struggled to get out when the pyre was lit, but she was weighed down by logs and coconuts and youths with swords who pushed her back onto the pyre. Eyewitnesses reported to the police that they heard her shouting and crying for help,\u201d the report added. Ms Seshu says \u201cone may couch it in the language of valour and sacrifice, but it was nothing but a horrific murder\u201d. She says when she met Kanwar\u2019s parents and brothers, \u201cthey were angry and willing to fight. But they later changed their stance under pressure from community leaders\u201d. Her eldest brother Gopal Singh disputes this, and told the BBC they initially suspected foul play. \u201cBut our aunts who lived in Deorala told us that it was Roop\u2019s decision. So, the elders in the family decided to drop it. There was no pressure on us.\u201d Mr Singh later went on to join the Sati Dharma Raksha Samiti \u2013 a committee formed to valorise Kanwar\u2019s immolation \u2013 and became its deputy chief. After its glorification was made illegal, the group dropped sati from its name. He said he had spent 45 days in prison on charges of sati glorification but was acquitted in January 2004 for \u201clack of evidence\u201d.\n\nRajput organisations organised protests in support of their right to worship goddess Sati\n\nMs Seshu says the general consensus when they visited the village after the incident was that \u201csati happens, women do it. The police and administrations were so complicit in the celebrations that no genuine efforts were made to collect evidence or fix responsibility\u201d. What was most tragic, she adds, was that Kanwar\u2019s death was used by the Rajput community as a mobilising force to benefit them politically and to make money. \u201cThe supporters wanted to build a temple at the site but the new law which banned sati glorification also barred construction of temples or collection of money from visitors. Now this acquittal could open the gates for a revival of religious tourism to the place.\u201d In Deorala, the spot at the edge of the village where Kanwar died, still attracts some visitors all these years later. A photograph taken a year back shows a family lighting a lamp before a framed picture of Kanwar and her husband, placed under a small brick structure draped with a red and gold scarf. But despite Kanwar\u2019s deification, chances of justice for India\u2019s last sati remain dim.",

    "Apple accused of trapping and ripping off 40m iCloud customers\n\niCloud is the online storage service from Apple\n\nApple is facing a legal claim accusing it of effectively locking 40 million British customers into its iCloud service and charging them \"rip off prices\". Consumer group Which? says the legal action - which it has launched - could result in a \u00a33bn payout if it is successful, with the average customer getting around \u00a370. Apple has rejected the suggestion its practices are anti-competitive, saying users are not required to use iCloud. It said many customers rely on third-party alternatives, and insists it \"works hard to make data transfer as easy as possible\". It is another example of the \"growing tide of large class actions against big tech\" which has \"operated without sufficient constraint\", Toby Starr from legal firm Humphries Kerstetter told the BBC. Facebook, Google, gaming giant Steam and the UK's leading mobile providers are among the others facing legal claims at the same court, the Competition Appeal Tribunal. \"Although most of these claims are in their infancy and take a long time to resolve, there will be more decisions coming out over the next couple of years and there will be settlements - these will start to affect the tech giants\u2019 businesses,\" said Mr Starr.\n\nUsers of Apple products get a small amount of digital storage for free \u2013 and after that are encouraged to pay to use its iCloud service to back up photos, videos, messages, contacts and all the other content which lives on their device. Prices for this storage range from \u00a30.99 a month for 50GB of space to \u00a354.99 a month for 12TB. Apple does not allow rival storage services full access to its products. It says that is for security reasons - but it also contributes to the company's enormous revenues, external. Which? says over a period of nine years dating back to 2015 Apple has been effectively locking people into its services - and then overcharging them. \"By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions,\" the body's chief executive Anabel Hoult said. \"Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.\" \"We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anti-competitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise,\" it said in a statement.\n\u2022 None Why it is becoming easier to sue Big Tech in the UK\n\nWhich? says the legal action will be funded by Litigation Capital Management, and the consumer group has instructed the international law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Which? said the firm would be paid fees as the case progressed, getting additional payments if it was successful - but they would not be getting a percentage of any damages. Alan Davis, from law firm Pinsent Masons, said there were very likely to be more, similar cases in the future. \"It is inevitable that further claims of this nature will continue to be brought given the very high value of the aggregate damages and the role of and incentive for litigation funders to support these claims which might not otherwise be brought without that financial support,\" he told the BBC. He added the absence of any infringement decisions under EU or UK competition law meant it would be down to the claimant to prove the market abuse it was alleging was actually taking place. However, he pointed out the regulator had announced a wider investigation into cloud services, external in the UK. Legal actions against big tech firms can take years as they work their way through the courts. Which? has urged Apple to resolve this \"without the need for litigation\", and wants the tech giant to offer consumers their money back and to open up competition further.",

The inquiry heard that:\n\u2022 None Staff received a report in 2015, at the time the hospital opened, which indicated that the water supply was at a high risk of infection\n\u2022 None Head of estates Ian Powrie, who commissioned the mandatory report, admitted he \"dropped the ball\" and had not read the document until three years later.\n\u2022 None The hospital's second in charge, Dr Jennifer Armstrong, admitted being \u201ctaken aback\u201d that the hospital had \u201cnot been built right\u201d - but did not believe there was evidence the problems with the building caused the unusual infections.\n\u2022 None Dr Christine Peters, a senior microbiologist and former infection control doctor who became a whistleblower, said she still had ongoing concerns about the building and that there was a \u201cserious problem with culture which does not value honesty\u201d.\n\u2022 None The chairman of an independent investigation concluded there was a likely link between some infections in child cancer patients and the contaminated water supply. But Prof Mike Stevens said he felt the health board's chief executive had tried to \u201cturn the screw\u201d on him to alter the findings of his review. Affected families told BBC Scotland News that three years on from giving their evidence to the inquiry, they had heard nothing to reassure them the problems at the hospitals had been fully addressed. They also claimed that senior executives were more concerned with protecting the reputation of the hospital than patient safety.\n\nCharly contracted a number of infections during her time in hospital\n\nMark Bisset, from Peebles, still takes his 12-year-old daughter Charly to the Royal Hospital for Children for routine appointments. She was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2019 at the age of seven and underwent a stem cell transplant in the adult hospital because the child cancer wards were closed after a series of infection outbreaks. Charly also contracted a number of infections during her five-month inpatient stay, which he believes could have come from the building. \u201cFour times our other children had to come in and say goodbye to their sister,\u201d said Mr Bisset. Charly is now cancer free but still requires support for ongoing health issues. Mr Bisset says the family are still \u201cpetrified\u201d every time they visit the hospital. \u201cYou get the fear. I\u2019ve asked for her care to be moved to Edinburgh because I just don\u2019t trust that hospital any longer, I don\u2019t feel it is safe,\u201d he said. He said listening to the evidence at the inquiry had been hard, but that \u201cyou need the truth to come out\u201d.\n\nMaureen Dynes\u2019 husband Tony died in 2021 after cancer treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital\n\nLike other families we have spoken to, Mark says he does not trust senior figures at the health board - and that he has never been given assurances that the hospital is now safe. \"They are denying there is a link between the infections and the hospital,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve heard all this evidence where they deny there is a link, but when you go back there are still filters on the taps. \"If there wasn\u2019t a problem then why do they need filters on the taps?\" Maureen Dynes\u2019 husband Tony, 63, died in 2021, after cancer treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Maureen, from East Kilbride, only learned her husband had contracted two infections, stenotrophomonas and aspergillus, after requesting his medical records. She said some of the information coming out from the inquiry made her \u201cfeel sick\u201d and that it was \"disgusting\" the health board could have known about the problems. \"There is a clear lack of transparency,\" she said. \"If there was honesty and transparency about the state of the building it would allay some of the fears for people going in.\"\n\nThe inquiry is examining on the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus\n\nWhile work has been done on the water and ventilation in the children's wards, she was not aware of any changes to the ward where Tony was treated. \"It\u2019s the only bone marrow transplant ward in Scotland, it's where were are told is the safest place to go - but my experience is it's not as safe as it should be,\" she added. Louise Slorance\u2019s husband Andrew died from Covid while being treated for cancer at the hospital in 2020 and also tested positive for aspergillus. She still thinks there is a failure of governance and effective management at the hospitals, and that an interim report is \u201cvital\u201d due to what she believes is \u201can ongoing patient safety risk\u201d. Patrick McGuire - a partner with Thompsons Solicitors, which represents many families at the inquiry - said the evidence at the inquiry made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that the hospital was \u201cunsafe for patients and riddled with management failures from the beginning\u201d. He said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know if the hospital is now safe and this is of huge concern to my clients. \u201cThis is why it\u2019s vital that the inquiry consider publishing an interim report on the current levels of safety and what still has to be done to ensure the welfare of patients.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Hospitals Inquiry is being chaired by Lord Brodie\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the inquiry said: \u201cIn order to get to that final report as quickly as possible, Lord Brodie\u2019s approach is to focus on the final report.\u201d The inquiry is due to hear further evidence next April before closing hearings in August 2025. In a statement, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: \u201cWe can provide absolute assurance to all of our patients, families, staff and the public that our hospitals are safe. \u201cThis is clearly evidenced by publicly available indicators of safety collected and monitored at a local and national level. \"Mandatory surveillance of healthcare associated infections demonstrates NHSGGC consistently performs better than many other boards across Scotland and mortality rates at the QEUH campus are in line with, and at times lower than, the Scottish average.\u201d The health board said it would continue to support the inquiry to fully establish the facts. \"We extend our sympathies to any families who have lost loved ones in our care and all those affected during the inquiry,\u201d it added.",
    "Our era has been labelled \u201cthe algorithmic society\u201d \u2013 one in which, it could be argued, social media platforms and search engines govern speech in the same way nation states once did.\n\nThis means straightforward guarantees of freedom of speech in the US constitution can only get you so far, according to Jack Balkin of Yale University, external: \u201cthe First Amendment, as normally construed, is simply inadequate to protect the practical ability to speak\u201d.\n\nProfessors Riemer and Peter agree that the law needs to play catch-up. \u201cPlatforms play a much more active role in shaping speech than the law currently recognises.\u201d\n\nAnd, they claim, the way in which harmful posts are monitored also needs to change. \u201cWe need to expand how we think about free speech regulation. Current debates focused on content moderation overlook the deeper issue of how platforms' business models incentivise them to algorithmically shape speech.\u201d\n\nWhile Professor Candeub is a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d, he\u2019s also wary of the power concentrated in the platforms that can be gatekeepers of speech via computer code. \u201cI think that we would do well to have these algorithms made public because otherwise we're just being manipulated.\u201d\n\nYet algorithms aren\u2019t going away. As Bertram says, \u201cThe difference between the town square and social media is that there are several billion people on social media. There is a right to freedom of speech online but not a right for everyone to be heard equally: it would take more than a lifetime to watch every TikTok video or read every tweet.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, is the solution? Could modest tweaks to the algorithms cultivate more inclusive conversations that more closely resemble the ones we have in person?\n\nNew microblogging platforms like Bluesky are trying to offer users control over the algorithm that displays content \u2013 and to revive the chronological timelines of old, in the belief that offers an experience which is less mediated.\n\nIn testimony she gave to the Senate in 2021, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said, external: \u201cI\u2019m a strong proponent of chronological ranking, ordering by time\u2026 because we don\u2019t want computers deciding what we focus on, we should have software that is human-scaled, or humans have conversations together, not computers facilitating who we get to hear from.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Professor Narayanan has pointed out, \u201cChronological feeds are not \u2026 neutral: They are also subject to rich-get-richer effects, demographic biases, and the unpredictability of virality. There is, unfortunately, no neutral way to design social media.\u201d\n\nPlatforms do offer some alternatives to algorithms, with people on X able to choose a feed from only those they follow. And by filtering huge amounts of content, \u201crecommendation engines provide greater diversity and discovery than just following people we already know\u201d, argues Bertram. \u201cThat feels like the opposite of a restriction of freedom of speech \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism for discovery.\u201d",

    "Lib Dem leader Ed Davey in bid for Christmas No 1\n\nSir Ed Davey spent much of the summer trying to get to No 10 (Downing Street). Now he has set his sights higher, as he launches a bid to get to No 1 - No 1 in the Christmas singles charts that is. The Liberal Democrat leader is teaming up with the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir to release the charity single, Love is Enough. The song was written by six young carers and former carers, and celebrates the bond they have with the people they care for. Proceeds from the single will go towards supporting the Carers Trust and the Bath Philharmonia.\n\nSir Ed, who as a teenager nursed his mother when she had terminal cancer, said he hoped the song would \"strike a chord\" with carers and their families. \"When I heard the opening lyrics to Love is Enough - 'every second we have left is worth a thousand others' - they struck home and meant so much,\" he said. Jason Thornton, music director of Bath Philharmonia, said: \u201cWhen creating Love is Enough, the young carers shared a profound message: Love is everywhere, even when it\u2019s taken for granted. \"They wanted to remind us all that, no matter who or where you are, there is always someone out there for you.\"\n\nAs far as we can tell, Sir Ed is the first leader of a major political party to release a Christmas single (although in 2017 Lord Buckethead put out his festive song, A Bucketful of Happiness). The single is just the latest in a series of headline-grabbing antics the Liberal Democrats have deployed in recent years. Throughout the general election, Sir Ed took part in increasingly eye-catching stunts, starting with a paddle-boarding excursion in Windemere and culminating in a bungee jump in Eastbourne. It seemed to pay off with the party winning a record number of seats and becoming Westminster's third largest party. At his party's conference earlier this year, he continued to embrace his 'embarrassing dad' persona, leading party members in a less-than-tuneful rendition of Abba's Take A Chance On Me. Those hoping to hear Sir Ed on lead vocals in the new single may be disappointed. In Love is Enough, Sir Ed perhaps wisely leaves the bulk of the singing to the members of the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir. He joins in at the bridge around three quarters of the way through the song and during the chorus - but there is no big show-stopping solo.\n\nSir Ed faces stiff competition from perennial Christmas favourites such as Mariah Carey\n\nDuring the general election Sir Ed's main rivals included Rishi Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage. Now, in his bid for chart-topping glory, he faces competition from the likes of Ed Sheeran, Tom Grennan and the 40th anniversary remake of Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas. There are also other challengers in the field of charity singles. The Celebs (including ex-boxer Frank Bruno and The Chase's Anne Hegarty) have released a cover of All You Need is Love to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital. Reverend and The Makers are putting out Late Night Phonecall to support the Samaritans. Although Sir Ed may be challenging some big names, there is a fine tradition of choirs making it to number one at Christmas - so he may have chosen a perfect musical coalition by teaming up with the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir. St Winifred's School Choir famously kept John Lennon off the Christmas top slot in 1980 with There's No-One Quite Like Grandma. They were followed by the Military Wives in 2011 and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir in 2015. But getting a Christmas number one is more complicated than it used to be, when the winner was simply the one which had sold the most singles. These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded). As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required. But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York. A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year. Wham! racked up 13.3 million streams a year ago to clinch that accolade \u2013 so if over the next few weeks we notice Sir Ed and his fellow Lib Dems frantically tapping at their phones, we will know the reason why.",
    "Number of homeless people in Wales at record high\n\nCharmaine Denton is among the 6,447 households living in temporary accommodation in Wales\n\nCharmaine Denton has been waiting more than two years for a permanent home and she is far from the only one. The 38-year-old is \"scratching at the door\" to move after three years in supported housing, which she said had affected her mental health and left her feeling like her life was on hold. Homelessness is at a record level in Wales and the number using temporary accommodation, such as B&Bs, has risen by 18% to 6,447 in 2023-24. Charmaine, from Carmarthenshire, said: \"I was hoping to put up my own Christmas tree this year. I just want somewhere to call home - that's what everyone deserves, isn't it?\"\n\nShe moved into care when she was three and had a chaotic childhood. By 14 she was living in temporary accommodation and had her first flat two years later. \"I wasn't ready to be self-reliant and run my own property. I don't think many 16-year-olds are,\" she said.\n\nShe takes full responsibility for her actions but said a lack of support and a life of chaos led to her taking heroin and crack cocaine. \"You don't recognise you're going to be really heavily into drugs when you're 16, you just think it's one big party.\"\n\nShe lost her flat, went to prison, slept on the streets and lived in temporary accommodation. \"It was hard trying to stay clean there. I'm not blaming anyone, but there's only so much you can keep away from it when people are fighting in the hallway and they're up at three in the morning, knocking your door flat out.\" Charmaine now lives in a shared recovery-focused house run by homeless charity, The Wallich. Hers is one of nine rooms with a bathroom and kitchenette and she is proud to have changed her life and wants to give something back.\n\n\"My past made me stronger, I don't look at it as bad - I look at it as experience. I'm hoping I can turn it round into a positive,\" she added. She wants to continue voluntary work but cannot until she finds a permanent home. This year will be her fourth Christmas in temporary accommodation.\n\nJamie-Lee Cole from The Wallich said Charmaine's situation was an example of the bottleneck in temporary accommodation where there was a \"swelling\" of people needing it but with nowhere to move them on to. She said as well as the effect on Charmaine's mental health, for some there was a risk of relapse or reoffending.\n\nHomelessness is currently at the highest level since 2015, external - 13,539 households in 2023-24, up 8% in a year. The Bevan Foundation think tank said, external one in every 215 households and six in every 1,000 children now live in temporary accommodation.\n\nNewport, the fastest-growing city in Wales, has the highest homeless rate in the country - it has risen by more than 50% over the past year to a record 1,359 households. In September 2024, 594 households lived in temporary accommodation at a cost of \u00a36.5m to the city's council, up \u00a31.4m on the previous year.\n\nHousing advice and prevention officer for Newport City Council, Hannah Berry, said that each day is different at the housing options drop in service\n\nThursday mornings are busy at the housing drop-in service at Newport Central Library. Housing advice and prevention officer Hannah Berry said: \"People can be very angry, upset, frustrated... they just want a home.\" She said the hardest part of the job was turning people away \"We do our very best to help everybody, but we're restricted by budget, lack of housing, lack of provision and lack of other services.\" As a mother herself, she said it was particularly difficult to see families with children \"facing the toughest thing in their lives\".\n\nKath Howells, service manager for housing at Newport council, said it was the most challenging time in the 20 years she has worked in the sector\n\nKath Howells from Newport council said Wales was feeling the brunt of the housing crisis, with private rented homes too expensive for most people and a lack of other options. She said high demand and a very low turnover of housing association stock meant they could not \"move people into the homes they need and deserve\". She encouraged people at risk of losing their home to speak to the council as quickly as possible.\n\nSteffan Evans from The Bevan Foundation, external said the percentage of social homes as the total of the housing stock had almost halved in 40 years. \"We know that the Welsh government has got its 20,000 affordable homes target... but that target can't be the end, we need to go further than that,\" he said.\n\nThe Welsh government said tackling homelessness was a priority and it had \"allocated record levels of funding\" since 2021 - \u00a31.4bn - and was investing nearly \u00a3220m in homelessness prevention and housing support this year. A spokesman added: \"The increase in people being supported with temporary accommodation reflects the ongoing pressures within the system and the effects of the cost-of-living crisis on individuals and households.\"",
    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nSara Sharif begged her parents for forgiveness for \u201cbeing rude\u201d in a letter discovered after her death, a court has heard. The 10-year-old\u2019s letters and notebook were seized by police after her body was found with dozens of injuries at the family\u2019s home in Woking, Surrey, last year. The court previously heard that Sara had been hooded, burned and beaten during more than two years of abuse. Sara\u2019s father Urfan Sharif, 42, stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder and causing or allowing her death.\n\nOfficers went to the family\u2019s house the day after Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Sara's five brothers and sisters on 9 August 2023. In an undated and misspelled letter to Mr Sharif and Ms Batool shown to jurors, Sara wrote that she was \u201csorry for being rude\u201d and \u201canswering back\u201d. \u201cPlease forgive me. I am so, so sorry,\u201d it said. In a birthday message to her father, Sara wrote: \u201cI love you so much. Thank you for looking after us on the weekends. And making food for us at the weekends. Thank you dad. From Sara. \u201cOur family is the best in town. We spread love all around the world.\u201d Her notebook also contained a short fairy tale about a queen called Beinash and a princess called Sara. Sara also described Ms Batool as the \u201cbest caring and loving mother in the world\u201d in the notebook.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nAt the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Cavanagh also told the jury that they may consider an alternative charge of manslaughter. He said while murder and causing or allowing the death of a child were the charges on the indictment, manslaughter could also be considered if the jury was not certain that murder had been proved. For a conviction on a charge of manslaughter, the jury must be sure that the defendants intended to cause \u201csome physical harm\u201d, he added.\n\nA post-mortem examination found Sara had suffered injuries including \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water before she died on 8 August 2023. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC previously said a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. Under cross-examination, Mr Sharif previously accepted \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Sara's death, but later denied intending to kill her. He also told the jury he was lying when he called his wife, Ms Batool, a \u201cpsycho\u201d earlier in the trial. Mr Sharif admitted beating Sara, but denied biting or burning her.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

The menu at Nottingham's Lace Market Fish Bar is typically a variety of fish and chips, kebabs and burgers, but on Wednesday night it served up something different. In the first night of its kind for the chippy, it hosted local grime and garage MC Window Kid and British DJ Nathan Dawe. The floor shook as the event spilled on to the streets and staff said people could not wait for the next one.\n\nThe Window Kid from Arnold, known to friends as Greg, has been a regular customer of the Lace Market Fish Bar for years. \"It's my local chippy, and we thought it was a place where everyone's welcome,\" he said.\n\nMC Window Kid and DJ and producer Nathan Dawe performed a new song\n\nWith 24 hours' notice, the micro-rave sold 35 tickets, but hundreds more attended, the MC said. \"It couldn't have gone any better.

    "Putin says Russia will use new missile again in 'combat conditions'\n\nRussia has a stock of powerful new missiles \"ready to be used\", President Vladimir Putin has said, a day after his country fired a new ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an unscheduled TV address, the Russian leader said the Oreshnik missile could not be intercepted and promised to carry out more tests, including in \"combat conditions\". Russia's use of the Oreshnik capped a week of escalation in the war that also saw Ukraine fire US and British missiles into Russia for the first time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for world leaders to give a \"serious response\" so that Putin \"feels the real consequences of his actions\".\n\nHis country was asking Western partners for updated air defence systems, he added. According to news agency Interfax-Ukraine, Kyiv is seeking to obtain the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), or to upgrade its Patriot anti-ballistic missile defence systems. In Friday's address Putin said the Oreshnik hypersonic missiles flew at 10 times the speed of sound and ordered them to be put into production. He had earlier said that use of the missile was a response to Ukraine's use of Storm Shadow and Atacms missiles. Thursday's strike on Dnipro was described as unusual by eyewitnesses and triggered explosions which went on for three hours. The attack included a strike by a missile so powerful that in the aftermath Ukrainian officials said it resembled an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Justin Crump, CEO and founder of the risk advisory company Sibylline, told the BBC that Moscow likely used the strike as a warning, noting that the missile - which is faster and more advanced that others in its arsenal - has the capacity to seriously challenge Ukraine's air defences.\n\nThis week's escalation has also prompted several warnings from other world leaders about the direction of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the war was entering a decisive stage - with a real risk of global conflict. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban meanwhile said the West should take Vladimir Putin's warnings \"at face value\" because Russia \"bases its policies primarily on military power\". And North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un warned \"never before\" had the threat of a nuclear war been greater and accused the US of having an \"aggressive and hostile\" policy towards Pyongyang. North Korea has sent thousands of troops to fight on Russia's side and Ukrainian forces have reported clashes with them in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops are occupying some territory. US President Biden has said he gave Ukraine permission to use longer-range Atacms missiles against targets inside Russia as a response to Moscow's use of North Korean troops. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both countries are now trying to secure a battlefield advantage before Donald Trump becomes US president in January. Trump has vowed to end the war within hours but has not provided details as to how. In his nightly address, Zelensky also criticised China for its response to Moscow's new missile after China's foreign ministry said all parties should \"remain calm and exercise restraint\". \"From Russia, this is a mockery of the position of states such as China, states of the Global South, some leaders who call for restraint every time,\" he said. He also criticised the Ukrainian parliament for postponing a session on Friday over security concerns following the attack on Dnipro. In a post on Telegram, he said unless an air raid signal sounded everyone should work as normal - and not take Russian threats as \"permission to have a day off\". \"The siren sounds - we go to shelter. When there is no siren - we work and serve. There is no other way in war,\" he said.",
    "Sperm donor compensation has risen from \u00a335 to a maximum of \u00a345 per clinic visit. The \u00a310 rise comes into effect in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1 October, when egg donor compensation also rises from \u00a3750 to \u00a3985, which the fertility regulator clarified today. It is illegal to pay someone to donate sperm or eggs in the UK so the money is to cover expenses such as travel and accommodation. Sperm donation can involve visiting a clinic once a week for three to six months. The UK fertility regulator acknowledged a shortage of egg and sperm donors. But it warned donating was a \"complex decision\" and any child born had the right to contact their biological parents after reaching 18 years old.\n\nOne sperm donor, who the BBC is calling Joseph, said the \u00a335 he received for each clinic trip did not compensate him \"anywhere near enough\" for his time and travel - but said his motivation was to help people. \"I'm a married gay man and we adopted our son so we didn't have the normal route that most heterosexuals couples will have had into parenting,\" he said. \"Going through the adoption process, you meet a lot of straight couples who have had fertility problems. So I wanted to help and give someone a chance to start a family, whether it's someone with fertility problems, a lesbian couple or a single person.\" It is the first time compensation for sperm and egg donors in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has risen since 2011. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which sets the amount of compensation, said the change was partly due to inflation being high in recent years, but it warned against donating sperm or eggs for the money. \"Choosing to become a donor is a complex decision, with implications for the donor and their wider family, the recipient, and any child born as a result,\" a spokesperson for the fertility regulator said. \"Donors will go through rigorous medical screening and must be comfortable with the fact that any children born from their donation can contact them when they turn 18,\" the HFEA spokesperson said. Joseph said he was happy with the new compensation rate of \u00a345 per clinic visit. He added: \"I think it's difficult to strike a balance between compensating somebody and then paying too much and then making it a financial incentive.\" But there are groups who are concerned about the rise in compensation. Helen Gibson, founder of Surrogacy Concern, a UK group which campaigns on issues relating to surrogacy and gamete donation said the organisation did not support \"any payment for gametes\". \"Donations cannot be called altruistic while money is exchanged,\" she said. \"Young people\u2019s bodies are not resources to be mined for the benefit of older, wealthier couples and individuals. If there is a \u2018shortage\u2019 of donors coming forward, perhaps that reflects the fact that most people do not want their genetic children to be raised by others.\"\n\u2022 None Egg donors warned not to do it for the \u00a3986 cash\n\nOne way to tackle a sperm shortage is by importing it. The HFEA says the majority of imported sperm in the UK comes from sperm banks in the US and Denmark. Nicole Nel, operations and laboratory manager at the London Sperm Bank, believes the shortage is not due to a \"lack of applicants\" in the UK, but \"the lack in the quality of the applicants\". She also claimed the way people live their lives nowadays could be affecting the quality of sperm, adding that the London Sperm Bank can only accept a small percentage of people who apply to be donors. Ms Nel also believes the narrative is changing surrounding the typical sperm donor. Sperm donors in the UK generally need to be between the ages of 18 and 45. \"Maybe 20 years ago it was students but I think now it's a very healthy combination of people because infertility has become a more widely discussed topic and awareness has been increased around it,\" she said. \"I think the type of person that actually ends up becoming a donor is someone that is more aware of what they're doing, it's not your typical student just looking for an easy way to make money.\" The HFEA said UK sperm donors commonly visit a clinic \"once a week for between three and six months\". One of these visits will involve ejaculating into a sterilised cup and the sperm is then frozen and stored. It is not possible to donate anonymously and all donors are made aware that any child born can contact them once they turn 18.\n\nIf you have been a sperm donor or used donated sperm and would like to share your experiences please get in touch.",
    "Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy thinks an extended stint on the bench acted as motivation for Manchester United's two-goal Europa League hero Amad Diallo.\n\nAmad had been named as substitute in six successive games before being given a start against Greek side PAOK at Old Trafford.\n\nIn Van Nistelrooy\u2019s words, the 22-year-old responded by being \"our best player in the first half\", before \"winning us the game in the second\".\n\nAsked if being a substitute so often had been a motivating factor, Van Nistelrooy said: \"Apparently so.\"\n\nThe Ivory Coast international was by far United\u2019s biggest threat against limited opposition - he was prepared to run at the PAOK defence and carried on doing so, even when he did not get immediate reward.\n\nVan Nistelrooy accepted a first half in which United made \"many technical mistakes\" and had one shot on goal \"wasn't good\", but Amad made the difference after the interval.\n\n\"The second goal had everything in it that is Diallo,\" said Van Nistelrooy. \"He fought to win the ball off the defender, then pushed through to take the shot and had the quality to bend it around the goalkeeper.\n\n\"He is a great character and a hard worker. He shows that attitude in every training session. Every day in he comes to me and wants to do extra finishing, crossing, one v ones. He is asking how can I improve his shot, and his heading.\n\n\"He is constantly focused on learning and getting better. He is motivated to get the most from his career.\"\n\nAmad's present contract expires next June, although United do have the option to extend it by an additional year and he is keen to stay at the club for \"a long time\".\n\nNext week, he will have a new boss to impress as Ruben Amorim takes charge.\n\nVan Nistelrooy said he would have to \"check his phone\" to see if he had received a message from the Portuguese, although, for now, he seems happy both parties are concentrating on their current clubs.\n\n\"I think that Ruben focuses on [Sporting at] Braga and I focus on Leicester [in the Premier League on Sunday],\" the Dutchman said.",

    "Formula and equation sheets were originally going to stop being available for exams after 2024\n\nThe education secretary has said GCSE students should continue to be given formula and equation sheets to help in their exams. This year had been the final year students were expecting to receive that post-Covid support.

Ms Phillipson asked Ofqual to continue providing formula and equation sheets to maths, physics and combined-science students sitting their exams in 2025, 2026 and 2027. The exam aids were first introduced in 2022, to limit the impact of Covid-19 on learning.\n\nLast year, the previous, Conservative government said the exam aids would no longer be available to students from 2025 and pre-Covid exam arrangements would return.

In his response to Ms Phillipson, Sir Ian said it was important for teachers and students to have clarity on exam changes \"as soon as possible\". Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di\u2019Iasio said the move was one his union had \"long argued for\" and exams \"should not be a test of memory but of the ability of students to apply knowledge and learning\".

    "Ramez Abu Nasr managed to save his brother from the rubble\n\nWarning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and violence The hand was covered in dust, streaked with blood on the fingers and wrist, all that could be seen of the person who was killed. Like many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north. A teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive. But then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers. They leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men. In the narrow streets men dug with their hands. But there were no sounds coming from the rubble now. Whoever lay there was beyond help.\n\nThe Abu Nasr family were entombed by falling masonry after Israeli air strikes\n\nRamez Abu Nasr was digging for hours. His mother, father and brothers were entombed by the falling masonry. Ramez managed to save his youngest brother. The boy told him that he had heard his parents nearby, reciting the Shehada, the Muslim prayer of faith. Soon after they were silent. \u201cI took out my younger brother at the last moment. I don\u2019t know how we can go back to our home... without my mother, or father, or brothers,\u201d says Ramez. The family fled here from Jabalia when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began their renewed offensive against Hamas in the north twelve days ago. The IDF issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many thousands stayed behind, exhausted by constant displacement, fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies.\n\nInside a house that is still standing, a young man kneels in front of his dead sister. She looks to be in her thirties. \u201cOh God, my sister, my sister,\u201d he calls out. Civil Defence volunteers are gathering bodies from inside buildings. They find a badly wounded man and race to the ambulance. They are trying to save a life, but also are afraid of being bombed themselves. Ahmed al Kahlout from the local Civil Defence looked around him at the carnage. Behind him, a colleague tries to give CPR to a woman. It is hopeless. \"This is the al-Sayyed family house,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cThere are bodies, torn parts in this area... It is a horrible crime.\u201d Several ambulances are lined up in the streets. Most of those inside them are dead. Bodies are piled up. All ages. Blood seeps from the forehead of a small child. A woman, wrapped in a brightly coloured blanket is loaded beside her. Next to the ambulance a dead man, middle aged, is lying on a hospital trolley.\n\nMany of the casualties are taken to Jabalia\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital. It's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiyyah, told me by phone that his hospital faced a dire humanitarian crisis and accused Israel of imposing collective punishment. \"We urge the world to intervene and impose their humanity over the Israeli army, to open humanitarian corridors that allow the entrance of medical tools, delegations, fuel, and food so that we can provide humanitarian services for the children, newborn babies, and patients who are in need,\u201d he said. The United States has accused Israel of refusing or impeding up to 90% of aid to northern Gaza in the last month - and threatened to cut arms shipments unless there is change. Israel says it is taking American concerns seriously and is \u201caddressing the issue\". International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel. The IDF says it only targets \u201cterror cells\u201d and released a video of what it said was Hamas firing from within a clinic in Jabalia. The army also said they\u2019d found weapons and boobytraps in a medical facility. In the video an officer, his face blurred, points to booby traps and weapons and speaks to the camera: \u201cEverything here is a cynical exploitation of the civilian population, inside a clinic, inside a civilian compound. We will pursue these terrorists and find them in every corner.\u201d In Jabalia, a heavily pregnant woman is sitting in the dust outside a house. The Civil Defence workers arrive and help her onto a stretcher. Her father is there and tells her, \u201cYou are going to be ok. You are going to give birth, my heart.\u201d Then a shell explodes nearby. The small group rushes to the ambulance and escapes. Every day they plead for peace in Jabalia. For food, and medicine, for schools to open. They plead, but know their voices cannot make it stop. With additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen and Alice Doyard",

The Department for Business and Trade has asked management consultancy BCG to explore the possible ownership model, as first reported by Sky News. The business secretary expects to receive a report in the coming months, a government source said.\n\nSub-postmasters are responsible for the everyday management of more than 11,500 post offices across the UK. In July, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable told the Post Office inquiry that he had wanted to \u201caddress the imbalance\" between the Post Office and sub-postmasters by creating a \"mutual structure\u201d. He said he had raised some of these issues with the then Post Office boss Paula Vennells, but the change \"unfortunately never came to fruition\".

The relationship between the Post Office and the sub-postmasters has received widespread attention following the Horizon scandal. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts. It has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.

    "Rivals: Dame Jilly Cooper on why jogging is ruinous for our sex lives\n\nRivals is one of the year's best reviewed TV programmes, with a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"Would you like a large drink?\" A visit to Dame Jilly Cooper\u2019s house in the Cotswolds is everything you would hope it would be. It's just after midday, as displayed on the numerous clocks on the packed walls of her hall and living rooms. Almost every surface inch is taken up with art, family photos, framed cartoons or sporting memorabilia - including, rather unexpectedly, a signed Emile Heskey Liverpool shirt. Despite the relatively early hour, the writer of some of the best-selling novels of the 1980s is keen to share the contents of her drinks cabinet. She believes in providing old-school hospitality at the former 14th Century monks' dormitory she has called home for more than 40 years, and where she lived with her husband Leo until his death in 2013.\n\nDame Jilly Cooper, 87, in the living room of her house in the Cotswolds\n\nEarlier, on the way into her village, we drove past a jodhpur-clad gent on a horse, who gave us a roguish, charming smile. He could have ridden straight off the pages of one of her Rutshire Chronicles books. Her so-called \"bonkbusters\" - a term Dame Jilly does not like - were set in the world of the horse-owning, bed-swapping, countryside-residing upper classes. \"Low morals and high fences\" is how she rather perfectly sums up the books. With their mix of sex and scandal, they were publishing sensations. The second of the books, 1988's Rivals, has just been adapted into an eight-part Disney+ series with an all-star cast including Aidan Turner, David Tennant, Danny Dyer, Victoria Smurfit and Emily Atack.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, Rivals has become one of the year's best reviewed TV programmes. Lucy Mangan writing in the Guardian, external gave it five stars, saying \u201ceven the naked tennis scene is a triumph\". Camilla Long from The Times, external described it as: \u201cTwo fingers up to the puritans\u201d and \u201ca bra-off, knickers-down delight\u201d. The Financial Times, external called it \u201ca mash-up of Dynasty, Downton Abbey and the Carry On films\u201d which is \u201cpuerile, gratuitous and an absolute riot\u201d. While, even in the United States, The Chicago Tribune, external summed the show up as \u201cnot taking itself too seriously\" and \"all the better for it.\u201d Could this bonkbuster be Bafta bound?\n\nAidan Turner plays the 1980s TV presenter Declan O'Hara in the screen adaptation of Rivals\n\nDame Jilly served as an executive producer, which is why we have been invited to pay her a visit, although she does not want to claim credit for what she describes as an \"absolutely wonderful\" adaptation. \"How much of a say did I have? Not much,\" she laughs, explaining that her grandson Jago was a runner on the production, so when she went visited the set, she was better known as \"Jago's granny\". She suggested some changes, though. \"I did occasionally say, 'No, I don't think they should be jumping on each other quite so early in the story' and things like that.\"\n\nSet in the world of 1980s TV, Dame Jilly is relieved that the most outlandish sensibilities and plotlines of Rivals have not been toned down for a more sensitive 2024 audience. In the first episode, before even the opening credits, a pair of fully exposed male buttocks are on display during a \"mile-high\" sex scene on Concorde. \"That was not in the book,\" she nods approvingly. \"It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s quite naughty too.\" She pauses, before adding: \"There is a lot of sex. In one episode they have every member of the cast coupled and fornicating for the next 20 minutes and all of that.\" Dame Jilly sounds rather shocked by what she saw. \"Well, 87 is very old and you do forget about sex,\" she offers by way of explanation. When I ask her what in life makes her blush, she gives a rather surprising answer. \"Books I wrote in the old days. Because I'm amazed at some of the things I wrote about. They are quite strong.\"\n\nIt turns out that she is currently in the middle of re-reading Rivals to swot up ahead of more interviews about the show. \"Lots and lots and lots of sex,\" is her review. \"The 80s really were the most fun time,\" she muses. \"Masses of sex, masses of drinking, masses of parties. The younger generation all wish they had been born then.\" However, she's quick to point out that one of the most non-MeToo-friendly aspects of the TV series, when an uninvited bum grope is used as a replacement for a chat-up line, wasn't in the print version.\n\nThere are many aspects of the 1980s for which she is nostalgic, in particular what she perceives as a major change in the dynamics of relationships. \"I think women are much tougher, much stronger and much more forthright. And I think men are much, much less macho. I mean, macho has gone. You are not allowed to be macho. \"Women are stronger and men are weaker, therefore there is not so much sexual desire between them,\" is her summation. She also believes there is another contributing factor to a decline in modern love lives. \"Everybody jogs. They get up in the morning, they jog all around the countryside for hours. They do exercises. That\u2019s what they do now. They don't have sex any more. They are far too tired to have sex now. Jogging is bad for people's love life. Ruinous.\" Back in the 1980s, the idea of Jilly Cooper teaming up with Disney would have seemed as likely as Rivals being chosen for Jackanory. There is no doubt that she's thrilled by the collaboration.\n\nDame Jilly Cooper was made a Dame by King Charles in May\n\nIn previous adaptations of her work, Dame Jilly was not happy with the casting of \"the handsomest man in England\" Rupert Campbell-Black, the fictional former Olympian and future Conservative MP, notorious for his conquests in the boardroom and the bedroom. This time, the part has gone to the English actor Alex Hassell, who starred in His Dark Materials. In Rivals, he is seen without any material at all, courtesy of a nude tennis scene. \"They interviewed 600 people for that one,\" reveals Dame Jilly, who was delighted with the final choice, despite some obvious differences to her literary creation. \"He's very handsome. Rupert's blond-haired and blue-eyed in the book, but he's become dark and dark-eyed. But he\u2019s very sexy.\"\n\nFurther details about her main character are explained during a walk with Dame Jilly through her large garden, as she points out the view over a valley, which inspired the literary location of his mansion. She also guides us to small two-storey outbuilding, gently announcing: \"I wrote Rivals in there. Above a room with all the garden tools. It was very quiet.\" The only hard part about interviewing Dame Jilly is trying to stop her continually asking her own questions, such is her enthusiasm and interest in every aspect of life. She reveals that until Rivals she had never heard of Danny Dyer (\"he's lovely, quite shy\"), the aspect of modern life which most frustrates her is inheritance tax, and she is not a fan of the concept of internet dating (\"awful\").\n\nDame Jilly Cooper pictured at the premiere of Rivals earlier this month\n\nShe also enjoyed looking back at a busy year, which has included having a damehood bestowed on her by King Charles. It turns out he used the occasion to pass on some betting tips. \"He laughed and said, 'By the way, if you are going to Ascot, we\u2019ve got some rather good horses'.\" There was also an invitation to Downing Street by the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who had revealed himself to be a fan of her books. \"He was lovely,\" she enthuses. \"The King. A prime minister. I\u2019ve got about a bit,\" she giggles. \"There was me saying I never meet men any more.\" One thing she will not be doing is writing anymore Rutshire Chronicles: \"No, I think Rupert\u2019s old enough now.\" However, this TV version of Rivals, only goes up to halfway through the novel, so if successful, the plan would be more seasons. \"I hope so, yes,\" she beams. \"That would keep us all very happy for the next few years.\" We are invited to take a seat at the kitchen table, followed by an offer of cakes and more suggestions of stiff drinks. When I ask if a cup of tea could be an alternative, a look combining disappointment, disapproval and pity comes over her face. Once again, modern man has let Dame Jilly Cooper down. Rivals is on Disney+ from 18 October.\n\u2022 None Jilly Cooper on damehood and 'Dishy Rishi' being a fan. Video, 00:00:46Jilly Cooper on damehood and 'Dishy Rishi' being a fan",
    "Elon Musk is seen during the final match of the 2024 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York\n\nUS regulators and representatives of Elon Musk have remained tight-lipped over whether the billionaire attended an interview on Thursday about his takeover of Twitter - now called X, as required by a federal court. Last month, he was a no-show for a court ordered appearance at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) office in Los Angeles. However, Mr Musk fell unusually quiet on X not posting for several hours on Thursday morning, and on Friday wrote a post indicating he had visited Los Angeles. The SEC is investigating whether Mr Musk waited too long to disclose he was building up a stake in Twitter before his 2022 takeover - a delay he has previously described as a mistake.\n\nThe nation's top securities regulator had called for possible sanctions, if Mr Musk failed to attend. For the 10 September court hearing, the SEC said it spent thousands of dollars to dispatch three lawyers - two from San Francisco and another from Washington DC -so they could take a sworn deposition from the billionaire tech mogul. But three hours before the appointment, Mr Musk's lawyers notified the SEC that he would not be able to appear. Mr Musk, his lawyers wrote in a declaration, had urgently travelled to the East Coast a day earlier for a \"high-risk\" launch by his rocket company SpaceX. But SpaceX had posted about the timing of the scheduled launch two days before Mr Musk's deposition date. And a day ahead of the meeting, he told interviewers at a conference that he planned to travel to Florida \"if the weather is holding up\" for the launch. The SEC says he did not inform them of those plans. The government lawyers only learned of the post and interview later. They rescheduled the suddenly cancelled meeting and then they asked a federal court to make sure Mr Musk appeared. Mr Musk has given two depositions since the SEC began looking into his $44bn (\u00a334bn) purchase of Twitter in 2022. The agency has said in legal filings that it is probing whether his stock purchases before he bought the company outright and statements he made about those investments broke securities laws. But Mr Musk refused to give testimony a third time, with his lawyers sending a letter to the SEC accusing it of harassment. In October, the SEC asked a court to order him to provide more testimony. Mr Musk's reason for missing last month's appointment \"smacks of gamesmanship,\" SEC lawyers wrote in a 20 September filing. They asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to impose a penalty on him if he skipped the next meeting, arguing it was needed to deter him from \"failing to show up\" on Thursday. Mr Musk was supposed to seek written consent from the SEC or an order from the court to reschedule, they added. Replying in his own filing, his lawyer Alex Spiro of the law firm Quinn Emanuel, said his client and his companies have cooperated with the SEC in this investigation and several others. \"In this investigation alone, Mr Musk has produced hundreds of documents, he has sat for testimony twice, his wealth manager has sat for testimony three times, and other individuals connected to Mr Musk have also sat for testimony, all without rescheduling or cancelling any of those testimonies,\" Mr Spiro wrote. Mr Musk's lawyers say they too had travelled to Los Angeles to be at his deposition last month and \"immediately notified the SEC of the emergency\". The SEC declined to comment when approached by the BBC. But in a court filing, SEC lawyer Robin Andrews asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to take a hard line against the billionaire. \"The Court must make clear that gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,\" Mr Andrews wrote.",

At the time, Tyson apologised for her \"past actions\", but said her behaviour never \"extended beyond bad edgy jokes\" and denied ever grooming anyone. The alleged victim - who was named online - also defended her, saying the claims were \"massive lies\" and that they had never been \"exploited or taken advantage of\".\n\nMrBeast, 26, real name Jimmy Donaldson, hosts the largest channel on YouTube, with 325m subscribers, and is known for making videos of stunts, challenges and acts of philanthropy. Tyson, 28, who last year came out as transgender, has appeared regularly on the channel since it was launched in 2012. After the initial claims in July, MrBeast said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the \"serious allegations of Ava Tyson's behaviour online\" and \"opposed to such unacceptable acts\". On Friday, he shared a letter on X from Quinn Emanuel Urqhart & Sullivan LLP, the law firm he hired to conduct an investigation into the claims. The letter said the firm had conducted 39 interviews with current and former employees of MrBeast's company and reviewed over 4.5m documents collected from mobile phones, e-mails, and a variety of messaging platforms. \"Allegations of sexual misconduct... between company employees and minors are without basis. The allegations were soundly rejected, including by alleged victims,\" it said. It added that allegations the company had knowingly employed \"individuals with proclivities or histories towards illegal... conduct\" were \"similarly without basis\". The letter said some \"isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct were identified\" and that, once informed about them, the company had taken \"swift and appropriate actions\". Following the publication of the letter, the alleged victim of Tyson's behaviour said again that the claims were \"completely false\". \"People used my name to make very serious allegations and claims without ever speaking to me,\" they said. \"It was incredibly difficult having my name thrown around in a public forum without being given the opportunity to share the truth. \"The private investigators reviewed all my [direct messages] and interactions with Kris. \"I was not groomed. These were false allegations made up by other people with my name thrown in them.\"\n\nResponding to the initial allegations in July, Tyson apologised for her \"unacceptable social media posts, past actions, and to those who may feel betrayed by how I used to act online\", but added: \"I never groomed anyone\". \"To lump these two factors together to create a narrative that my behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen,\" she said. \"I have learned that my old humor is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself.\"",
    "The firm said its commercial online operations, including its large language AI models, were unaffected\n\nTikTok owner, ByteDance, says it has sacked an intern for \"maliciously interfering\" with the training of one of its artificial intelligence (AI) models. But the firm rejected claims about the extent of the damage caused by the unnamed individual, saying they \"contain some exaggerations and inaccuracies\". It comes after reports about the incident spread over the weekend on social media. The Chinese technology giant's Doubao ChatGPT-like generative AI model is the country's most popular AI chatbot.\n\n\"The individual was an intern with the [advertising] technology team and has no experience with the AI Lab,\" ByteDance said in a statement. \"Their social media profile and some media reports contain inaccuracies.\" Its commercial online operations, including its large language AI models, were unaffected by the intern's actions, the company added. ByteDance also denied reports that the incident caused more than $10m (\u00a37.7m) of damage by disrupting an AI training system made up of thousands of powerful graphics processing units (GPU). As well as firing the person in August, ByteDance said it had informed the intern's university and industry bodies about the incident. ByteDance operates some of the world's most popular social media apps, including TikTok and its Chinese-equivalent Douyin. It is widely seen as a leader when it comes to algorithm development due to how appealing its apps are to users. Like many of its peers in China and around the world, the social media giant is investing heavily in AI. It uses the technology to power its Doubao chatbot as well as many other applications, including a text-to-video tool called Jimeng.",
    "Men buy more from Lidl middle aisle, says boss\n\nMen are buying more from Lidl\u2019s middle aisle, its UK boss has said as the supermarket returned to profit after a loss-making year. Ryan McDonnell said the middle of Lidl, known for its unusual stock which ranges from power tools to inflatables, had a \u201cbig male following\u201d. \"We often get partners at odds with each other because men have disappeared up the aisle and are buying things they maybe already have,\" he told the BBC. His comments came as Lidl reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a343m, compared with a loss of \u00a376m the previous year.\n\nIt saw a 16.9% jump in annual sales for the year to the end of February 2024 with sales of nearly \u00a311bn. It\u2019s 30 years this month since Lidl arrived in the UK. It now has more than 960 shops and is the nation's sixth biggest grocer. Mr McDonnell has been with the firm for most of it and remembers the early no frills stores packed with unfamiliar products. \u201cI remember selling pallets of more continental products. We\u2019ve come a long way, evolving our ranges,\" he said. One of its quirks is \"the middle of Lidl\" and a trip to the retailer has become synonymous with shoppers returning with something they had not gone in for.\n\n\"There are some interesting shopping habits in this aisle,\" he said, adding he had known rows between couples after a man had become \"intrigued by a gadget or two\". \"I would say there are a lot of men in trouble when they come in here,\" he said. There are Facebook pages, Reddit threads and YouTube videos dedicated to middle-aisle finds. \"My mum came back with a two-man canoe despite not living near any suitable body of water,\" one Reddit user posted on a thread about things people had found. \"A flamethrower,\" another user posted. \"It was for getting rid of weeds.\" Aside from the middle aisle, Mr McDonnell said there had been a lot of early spend on mince pies, party food and panettone. He said Lidl had won a lot of new customers and many were in a \u201cconfident mood\" for Christmas despite the tough economic backdrop. Lidl has been freshening up the look of its stores, putting bakeries at the entrances and displaying more fruit and veg. Both categories have seen a jump in sales. Amid cutthroat competition and price matching, Mr McDonnell believes the shopping experience is just as important as the price to keep pulling customers in.\n\nLidl UK boss Ryan McDonnell said changes announced in the Budget would add tens of millions to the retailer's costs\n\nLidl is the fastest-growing supermarket chain in the UK this year but, like other retailers, it is now having to deal with the impact of the Budget. Supermarkets employ large numbers of people and profit margins are slim. Mr McDonnell warned tax rises announced in the Budget would add tens of millions of pounds to its costs in the coming year. The bosses of Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks & Spencer have both warned shoppers could face higher prices as a result of an increase in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs). On Tuesday, Lidl joined dozens of High Street giants in signing a letter to the Treasury warning job losses were \"inevitable\" and price rises \"a certainty\" as a result of measures announced in the Budget and other rising costs. The Treasury told the BBC the government \"had to make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\".\n\nMr McDonnell declined to put an exact figure on the extra cost of NICs, but said it was just one of a number of new costs coming down the track creating a cumulative burden for the industry. \u201cWe're talking about National Insurance, National Living Wage, we're talking about business rates. We have packaging and recycling taxes coming in. That's a lot of pressure on business all at once,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the government needs to review how they intend to inspire growth.\" However, he insisted Lidl\u2019s investment plans in the UK would not change, with 18 more stores due to open in the next few months followed by 40 in the next financial year.\n\nDo you buy things you didn't plan to when you go to the supermarket?

    "Mr Gilliver has been shortlisted in the British Photography Awards for his image\n\nIf you have ever written your name in the air with a sparkler on bonfire night then you have experimented with light painting. Baffled by the \u201clines of light floating in mid-air\u201d, Scottish photographer David Gilliver knew he had to try capturing them with his camera. \"I thought it was like sorcery, it's like magic,\u201d he says. For 15 years, Mr Gilliver has been a pioneer in the technique of light painting. Now, one of his pictures - which he has called Where Rainbows Sleep - has been shortlisted for this year\u2019s British Photography Awards, external in its newest category - best low light photograph.\n\nPicture this: Mr Gilliver is stood in a pitch black fishing boat hut, dressed head to toe in dark clothing, holding a \u201clight sabre\u201d. No, he's not re-enacting Star Wars - this is just how the process of making the photo begins. To blend into the low-light background, Mr Gilliver must imitate one of film\u2019s greatest villains. He channels his inner Darth Vader but instead of \"the force\" he uses a long exposure photography technique, keeping the shutter open for anything from 30 seconds to 20 minutes. His camera, which he controls remotely, is at the other end of the room securely fixed to a tripod, because even the slightest movement will cause a blurring of the image. Mr Gilliver moves towards the camera, swooshing his light sabre before disappearing down the trap door. The exposure length gives him enough time to fire a flash gun manually to illuminate the boat hut surroundings.\n\nThe photographer immerses himself in the creative escapism of light painting\n\n\"Simple is often best\", Mr Gilliver says, when it comes to creating his waves of light. But he also loves to experiment. In another photo, he uses butterfly keyrings with battery-operated lights to create an image of multiple floating butterflies. He also created an eerie orb sitting within the ancient Callanish stones on the Isle of Lewis, by swinging a light on the end of a string like a lasso during the long exposure time.\n\nThe 45-year-old Glasgow School of Art graduate has always had an artistic eye. However, making a living as an artist initially proved difficult and he ended up working in finance in the Channel Islands for 14 years. He became \"utterly obsessed\" with light painting to capture the \"magical\" landscapes of Guernsey at night. When he moved back to Scotland in 2015, he says the \"dramatic\" and \"iconic\" backdrops of the country kept his creativity alive. In 2018, he abandoned his 9 to 5 life to finally take up photography full time.\n\nDavid Gilliver uses the moonlight to illuminate the dark backgrounds\n\nWhen he started posting his light paintings online, he says most people would ask him how he did it. Photographers would ask to come with him while he created his images, he says. Mr Gilliver, who lives in Gartcosh, North Lanarkshire, now teaches his own workshops across the UK. He says most people think the technique is hard to understand but actually it is \"very accessible\" once people start to experiment and play with light. He says teaching \"found\" him and he enjoys people's natural curiosity. \"Watching their eyes light up as they begin to learn what the creative possibilities are of this amazing art form is one of the many joys of teaching,\" he says.\n\nLoch Lomond is one of Mr Gilliver's favourite places to teach\n\nAlong with light painting, Mr Gilliver has a large portfolio of macro photography. The technique is a form of extreme close-up photography and can be used to capture small objects, flowers and insects. Mr Gilliver plays around with imaginative scenarios using small figurines. His photos range from iconic film scenes to handling more serious topics.\n\nThis year, his recreation of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's famous \"I'm flying\" scene from the blockbuster movie Titanic has been shortlisted in the macro category. It depicts a miniature Jack and Rose recreating the famous scene on top of an electric iron.\n\nDavid Gilliver won at the British Photography Awards last year\n\nHe is no stranger to the British Photography Awards, having already won the best macro photograph category in 2022 by turning a face mask into a swimming pool for a Covid pandemic image. \"Delivering a serious message without trivialising what you're talking about is the key,\" he says.\n\nThe photographer says it would be unfair to choose which of photographic forms he prefers. He says macro photography exercises his imagination but light painting feels more like an experience. The \"experiential\" side of light painting is what makes the \"incredible process reign supreme\", he says. Mr Gilliver has been shortlisted for three categories in this year's British Photography Awards, for best macro, low light and commercial photography. The awards will take place on 4 November.",
    "Nadia Ayoub McCulloch has been separated from her family when trying to leave Lebanon\n\nA Scottish family evacuated from Lebanon have spoken of their anger after their non-British mother was blocked from boarding the flight with two of her children. Nadia Ayoub McCulloch, 51, and her children Thomas, 19, and Rebecca, 16, attempted to fly out from Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport to Birmingham due to the ongoing conflict with Israel which has seen the city bombed. However, Ms McCulloch was turned away by officials as she does not have a UK passport or visa, meaning only her children were allowed to leave. Her Scottish husband of 20 years, William McCulloch, 62, now intends to travel back to Lebanon from Iraq in the hope he can reunite with his wife and leave the country together.\n\nHe said: \"I just don't understand it. We paid for the three seats, she went to the airport, and she was told that she can't get on the flight because she didn't have a visa. \"Rebecca organised everything and she may have been told before she left the house (that Ms McCulloch would be unable to board the flight), but she thought she would just go and try because she wanted to go with the kids, but she was told categorically, no.\"\n\nAs of last month, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals including dependants, in Lebanon. More than 250 UK citizens have already left on chartered flights. As of Friday morning, more than 2,000 British nationals had registered their presence in the country, the Foreign Office said. The UK government is chartering another flight for Britons to leave on Sunday, the fourth such flight organised since the escalation of the conflict in Lebanon. The Foreign Office said it did not normally comment on individual cases. The general advice is that spouses of British nationals are eligible to leave on the specially chartered flights but if they are not UK citizens, they must have a valid visa to stay in the UK for more than six months. , external A government spokesman said: \"We understand this is a worrying time for many. The safety of British nationals in Lebanon is our top priority and we urge everyone to continue to follow our travel advice. \"All non-British nationals requiring a visa will need to make an online visa application and submit their biometrics at a Visa Application Centre, prior to travel to the UK.\"\n\nWilliam McCulloch intends to travel back to Lebanon to help his wife leave\n\nMr McCulloch, who has lived in Lebanon since 2002, said the couple were evacuated with Thomas during the 2006 Lebanon war and had \"no problem whatsoever\" on that occasion. Mr McCulloch works with humanitarian organisation Norwegian People's Aid and is currently working to clear unexploded ordnance in Iraq. He will fly back to Beirut later in October, despite the continuing conflict. He added: \"I have no problems going back into Beirut - if something happens, something happens, but 100% I'm going back to my wife.\"\n\nHis son David Hardie, 36, who lives in Carluke, said it was a \"a lot of weight\" off his shoulders to have his siblings back in Scotland. He said: \"Even when they announced the flight, there was nothing about a ceasefire or how they were going to get to the airport or anything... that was scary for them, because you don't know when the next bomb is going to hit\". Mr Hardie said he was \"angry\" over the visa situation. He added: \"They've been married for over 20 years - it's not like they've been married for two or three years, they've been married 20 years, and she can't even get evacuated from a war.\"\n\nNadia Ayoub McCullough and Thomas, then a young child, left Lebanon during the 2006 conflict\n\nMr Hardie also criticised the cost of the UK government flights out of Lebanon, which were \u00a3350 per person. He said the cost was a \"low blow\". Mr Hardie added: \"We're not poor or anything but I still feel like, if you've been evacuated from a war-torn country, there should have been more help. \"I think that was a surprise. Like, you get a text message, you click a link, you go in, you sign your name, your passport number, and then at the end, it asks you for \u00a3350. \"There might have been families over there who couldn't afford that.\" The last week has seen a significant escalation of the crisis in the Middle East, with warning that it could develop into a all-out regional war. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel.",

It was brought down on top of him and his family last night by an Israeli airstrike, that killed at 18 people, four of them children, according to Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry. The attack happened without warning in a place where people thought they would be safe \u2013 about 150 metres from the entrance to Lebanon\u2019s largest public hospital, the Rafik Hariri hospital in southern Beirut. Mohammed and his family were asleep in their beds. \u201cWe didn't recognise what is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the strike we hear the sound like \u2018boom, boom, boom, boom\u2019 like this. And everything is thrown on us. Stones, metal, steel, fresh blood, fresh meat on us. You couldn't speak, you couldn't breathe, you couldn't take your oxygen.\u201d He names five neighbours who are still under the rubble of their home. And there were others, killed in an instant, in their own neighbourhood \u2013 including two 19-year-old girls who were sitting outside his door. Mohammed, 54, survived with a grazed arm, but his 20-year-old nephew is now in intensive care. \u201cHalf of his brain is crushed,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 None Lebanon says 18 killed in Israeli strike near southern Beirut hospital\n\u2022 None Biden 'deeply concerned' about apparent leak of Israel plan to attack Iran A civil defence worker at the scene told us six residential buildings had been brought down, most of them three or four stories high. A veiled woman sat on the ground, with her hands on her head, rocking back and forth in distress. \u201cThere are no Hezbollah here,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are all civilians\u201d. A neighbour said, \u201ceveryone flew through the air\u201d. Minutes later more remains were recovered from the rubble and carried away in a black body bag. I asked Mohammed what he thought Israel could have been targeting, in this heavily populated area. \u201cThey are hitting everything randomly,\u201d he replied, his voice strengthened by anger. \u201cWithout seeing there is children. Where are the guns here? Where are the rockets here? Blind, Israeli enemies. Blind.\u201d\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it struck a \"Hezbollah terrorist target near the hospital\u201d without providing any information about what the target was. It says the hospital itself was not targeted or hit. Rafik Hariri hospital director Jihad Saadeh said it was struck by shrapnel but is functioning normally and will not be evacuated. Not so for the Al Sahel private hospital, about 2km away, which was emptied out last night. \u201cWe evacuated instantly, like crazy,\u201d says Dr Mazen Alameh, the general manager. \u201cWe cannot risk anyone's lives. We cannot take it as granted that they (Israel) will not bomb.\u201d The hurried evacuation of 10 patients and 50 staff came after a public claim by the Israeli military that the hospital was sitting on top of a Hezbollah bunker, full of riches. The IDF gave no proof but produced a 3D animation, claiming to show a bunker beneath the building. \u201cThere are hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold inside the bunker, right now,\u201d said the IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. It sounded like an invitation to a heist.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The hospital is in the southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, but staff insist strongly that it is not linked with any group. \u201cIt's really shocking to say that Sahel Hospital is affiliated with any party in Lebanon,\u201d says Dr Alameh. \u201cIt's a private hospital. It's a teaching hospital for doctors, physicians and other medical students.\" He dismissed Israel\u2019s claim of a hidden bunker. \u201cThe hospital was founded 40 years ago on an old house,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have any tunnel or infrastructure underneath. Any person in the world can come here and see everything they want.\u201d We were encouraged to check in every corner. Nowhere was off limits, not even the morgue. Bundles of surgical scrubs, and packets of surgical instruments were opened to show there was nothing concealed. After the tour, we were allowed to move around freely. We saw empty wards and anxious staff, but no hint of a bunker. Israel claimed the entrance was in a neighbouring building. We went there too and had free access to the parking lot underneath. If there was an entrance to a secret bunker, we did not find it. The only door we saw led to a lift, which we could not open.

As it was underway, the IDF issued a warning, telling residents of two nearby buildings to leave as they were \u201clocated near Hezbollah facilities.\u201d Half an hour later two more multi story buildings vanished from the skyline in seconds, reduced to dark clouds of smoke and ash.

    "Moldova says 'Yes' to pro-EU constitutional changes by tiny margin\n\nTurnout in the two votes stood at more than 50%\n\nPeople in Moldova have backed the Eastern European country's proposed changes to its constitution and commitment to joining the EU by the thinnest of margins in a referendum. Official data put Yes on 50.46% and No on 49.54% on Monday afternoon, with more than 99.6% of votes counted. The knife-edge nature of the vote has come as a shock to many. The referendum had been widely expected to comfortably pass in the country of 2.6 million, which borders Romania and Ukraine. The vote was combined with presidential elections in which Maia Sandu, the incumbent pro-EU president, failed to win re-election outright and faces a second round next month.\n\nResponding to the referendum result, she said pro-EU forces had won the first battle in a \"difficult fight\", which she also called \"unjust\". She accused those she called Moldova\u2019s \"enemies\" - and criminal groups \u2013 of trying to buy votes and said it was a dangerous phenomenon for any democracy. On Sunday, Sandu had denounced the narrow result as the product of foreign interference in Moldovan politics and said Moldova had suffered an \"unprecedented assault on democracy\". On neither occasion did she refer to Russia explicitly, but in recent weeks Moldovan authorities uncovered a giant scheme of payments coming from Moscow \u2013 and paid to people to vote against her and the EU referendum. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Sandu would need to present \"evidence\" for her claims that there had been foreign interference in the vote. EU spokesperson Peter Stano said on Monday that the vote had taken place \"under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies\". Last month Ilan Shor, a pro-Russian Moldovan businessman and politician who now lives in Russia, said he would pay money to convince \u201cas many people as possible\u201d to vote No or to abstain in the EU referendum. This week, Shor then made a video statement telling people to vote for \"anyone but Sandu\" in the presidential election. On Sunday, the BBC stumbled upon evidence of vote-buying at a polling station for residents of the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria - which is economically, politically and militarily supported by Russia. A BBC producer heard a woman who had just dropped her ballot in the transparent box ask an election monitor where she would get paid. When we asked directly whether she had been offered cash to vote, she admitted it without qualms. She was angry that a man who had sent her to the polling station was no longer answering her calls. \u201cHe tricked me!\u201d she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nShe would not reply when asked who she had voted for. As well as the referendum on changing the constitution, Moldovans also voted in the country's presidential election on Sunday. The votes were seen as key tests for the country, which is facing a choice between pushing on with EU membership or keeping close ties to Russia. Sandu topped the election first round with 41% of the vote versus her closest opponent's 26%. The result for Aleksandr Stoianoglo, who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, was considerably higher than expected. Sandu will now face a difficult second round on 3 November in which her eliminated rivals - populist Renato Usatii and former Gagauzia governor Irina Vlah - will likely unite against her behind Stoianoglo.\n\nMaia Sandu arrives to give a press briefing in Chisinau, following a disappointing result for her\n\nShe accused \"criminal groups\" of working together with \"foreign forces\", using money, lies, and propaganda to sway the vote. Sandu also said her government had \"clear evidence\" that 300,000 votes were bought, which she called \"a fraud of unprecedented scale\". Moldova is currently in talks with the EU on becoming a member. These accession talks will continue despite Sunday\u2019s outcome, as the referendum was not legally binding. The vote, however, was supposed to make the process irreversible. Instead, it feels a little shakier now.\n\nAt Sandu's election headquarters on Sunday evening, the mood was extremely subdued, with one of her advisers describing the result so far as \"not what we expected\". Sandu, who has cultivated close ties with Moldova\u2019s EU neighbours, had campaigned for the Yes vote in the referendum. She had previously said the vote was would set up the future of Moldova for \"many decades ahead\". When the first results began trickling in showing that the No vote had done better than expected, Sandu\u2019s team put the disappointing results down to the first count coming in from villages and rural areas. The big city count narrowed the lead for the No vote, but by 01:00 (22:00 GMT) few thought the Yes camp could still stand a chance. Many of Sandu\u2019s supporters left her headquarters in Chisinau where they had been hoping to celebrate her victory before the count was even over. The little EU flags they\u2019d been given to wave were abandoned, on chairs or strewn on the ground. But as the night went on, the gap narrowed even further. In the end, the Yes vote clinched it - but only just. Voter turnout stood at more than 51% when polls closed at 21:00 local time (18:00 GMT), making the referendum valid. Several presidential candidates boycotted the referendum. Aleksandr Stoianoglo said he did not support the idea of changing the constitution - although he added he was a supporter of his country's \"European aspirations\". However, many young people queuing at polling stations on Sunday were vocal about their support for Moldova\u2019s future as an EU member state, with some saying they were voting because they wanted to choose a European future for their country \u2013 for the sake of the economy and for more opportunities. Some said they were fed up of being \"pulled\" towards Moscow, decades after the Soviet Union collapsed and Moldova became independent. \"We have to choose a European future for our country, for our children, our future \u2013 for geopolitics, for peace, that\u2019s the most important,\" a voter called Oksana told the BBC. \"Because we are between Europe and Russian influence, and we have to choose what we want.\"",
    "England have a 'point to prove' in pivotal SA series\n\nIn October, England failed to reach the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup for the first time since 2010\n\nWhether England want to admit it or not, they have a point to prove. Just over a month after their disastrous group-stage exit from the Women's T20 World Cup, Heather Knight's side are in South Africa for a multi-format series, which is followed by the Women's Ashes in Australia in January. The first of three T20s starts on Sunday (12:00 GMT), followed by three one-day internationals and then a four-day Test begins on 15 December. You can ball-by-ball radio commentary on every game on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text updates. It is a quick turnaround from such a disappointing World Cup campaign but seamer Kate Cross, who is in the ODI and Test squads, feels that will benefit England. \"Years ago, if you were knocked out of a World Cup, you had to wait until your summer to play cricket again and prove yourself,\" Cross told BBC's No Balls podcast. \"But I feel like cricket has been back on our horizon so quickly after that, against the team who lost the final, so we know we've got a chance to measure ourselves against a really strong team in their own conditions and you're back in the fight straight away.\" The fallout from the World Cup was possibly the harshest that an England women's side has faced, a stark reminder of the increased scrutiny and expectation that comes with the privilege of being a professional athlete. The team's fitness was questioned, alongside their off-field activities and social media presence. Knight and head coach Jon Lewis rejected the accusations and understandably defended their team, but acknowledged their need to improve in pressure moments - though that is something they have been saying for almost two years. Against South Africa, finalists of said World Cup, England have a chance to change these perceptions before entering the Ashes pressure cooker.\n\nLewis and Knight have put faith in their group, too. Top-order batter Alice Capsey was initially dropped from the World Cup squad for the T20 leg of the tour, but has since been recalled after an injury to all-rounder Paige Scholfield, while Danielle Gibson is the only other omission because of a knee problem. Fast bowler Lauren Filer comes into all three squads as a particularly exciting prospect for the Ashes. South Africa have rested star all-rounder Marizanne Kapp and seamer Ayabonga Khaka for the T20 series, but both will likely return for the ODIs and the Test. Lewis has acknowledged the difficulty in replicating high-pressure situations outside of matches, and going into the World Cup his side had barely been challenged in a relatively low-key summer which involved dominant series wins over Pakistan and New Zealand, who eventually won the tournament. But the intense two months ahead should not be lacking in pressure: South Africa will also have fire in the belly after losing the T20 final, while facing the game's dominant force, Australia, in their own backyard is one of cricket's greatest tasks. It will not be easy, considering the significant amount of time they will be spending away from home and against two high-quality teams. But it is a golden opportunity for England to silence critics and regain the form and excitement at the heart of their brand of cricket in 2023, the high-profile summer which saw both England men and women gripped in enthralling Ashes contests.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",
    "Rust premieres at low-key film festival three years after shooting\n\nThe film premiered on Wednesday in Torun, central Poland\n\nThe western Rust has premiered in Poland, three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was accidentally shot and killed on set in New Mexico. Organisers of Poland\u2019s Camerimage International Film Festival said the screening was a tribute to the 42-year-old Ukrainian-born cinematographer, who was a fan of the event and had attended in the past. The movie\u2019s star Alec Baldwin was not invited and did not attend the premiere. Writer and director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, told the BBC at the premiere that at one point he \"couldn\u2019t even conceive of ever being back on the set ever again, it just hurt too much\".\n\nHe said he changed his mind and decided to complete the film after speaking to Hutchins' husband, Matt. But the announcement that Camerimage in the northern Polish city of Torun was going to give the movie its international debut has been criticised by some prominent cinematographers in Hollywood for being disrespectful to Hutchins' memory. Hutchins\u2019 mother, Olga Solovey, who is suing the production and Alec Baldwin in a civil action, didn\u2019t attend either. In a statement issued by her lawyer she said she regards the premiere as an attempt to profit from her daughter\u2019s death. \u201cAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople queue for the screening, which wasn't completely full\n\nIn October 2021, Baldwin was rehearsing a scene on set with a gun, which was supposed to be loaded with dummy rounds, when the weapon fired a live round, killing Hutchins and wounding Souza. In July, a judge dismissed an involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin after police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defence. In March, the armourer on the film set, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and is serving an 18-month prison sentence. Prosecutors said she failed to notice that live bullets had mixed with dummy rounds in a box of ammunition on set. She has appealed against the verdict.\n\u2022 None How events unfolded after fatal shooting on Alec Baldwin film set Set in 1882 in Wyoming, Rust tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is sentenced to be hanged after he accidentally kills a rancher. He goes on the run with his grandfather, Baldwin\u2019s Harlan Rust.\n\nSouza, who attended the premiere with Bianca Cline who replaced Hutchins as the film\u2019s cinematographer, refused several requests to complete the film after the tragic shooting, said Hutchins' husband, Matt, convinced him to complete the film, which is dedicated to her. \"At first I didn\u2019t really know if I wanted to do this to be honest, but as I found out that this is what Matt wanted, this is what the family wanted, it started to change the equation for me,\" he told the BBC. \"It was going to be more about honouring her legacy and her memory, saying that her final work was completed and that began to change my mind on things,\" he added. Both he and Cline acknowledged that many in the industry were uncomfortable with his decision. \u201cEverybody\u2019s angry, we\u2019re angry as well. It\u2019s something tragic and it\u2019s hard to deal with. Some people think it\u2019s better to deal with that through not participating and other people think it\u2019s honourable like we do. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any right or wrong answer to this,\u201d Cline told the BBC.\n\nCinematographer Bianca Cline with the film's writer and director Joel Souza, centre\n\nBefore the screening, Rachel Mason, a close friend of Hutchins who filmed a documentary about the making of Rust, recalled how difficult it was to complete the movie with all the controversy surrounding it. She said some crew members told her not to film them on the closed set, in case, she said, it was discovered they had worked on Rust \"and I might never get a job again\". Crew came back to finish the filming after they realised it might help Hutchins' family. \"She had this amazing gift of becoming friends very, very fast with people. And they all fell in love with her,\" she said. Ms Mason also recounted a conversation with Hutchins' mother 18 months ago during which she told her she wanted the film to be completed because it was her daughter\u2019s \"big work\". Rust depicts the manhunt for grandfather and grandson amidst a backdrop of snow-capped mountains and tumbleweed dirt towns. It knowingly acknowledges classic westerns including John Ford\u2019s \u2018The Searchers\u2019 and Sergio Leone\u2019s \u2018The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u2019. Souza was very close to his own grandfather, who, he said, loved westerns. Several people I spoke to after the screening enjoyed the movie with Jan, a film colourist from Warsaw calling it \"a classic western\". Leonora, a cinematographer from Belarus said it was brilliant and she had cried all the way through Ms Mason\u2019s speech.\n\nHalyna Hutchins' friend Rachel Mason also spoke to the audience\n\nOne viewer noted the many gunfight scenes involving Alec Baldwin could be distracting. \u201cAll the time as I was thinking about it, especially during the gunfight scenes, it was hard not to get pulled back out of the movie, especially when Alec Baldwin\u2019s holding a gun, but most of the time it was just a really, really enjoyable experience,\u201d Maciej from Torun said. In a statement, Melina Spadone, representative for Rust Movie Productions, defended the festival against some of the criticism. \"The Camerimage festival celebrates the artistry of cinematographers; it is not a festival for buyers. \"None of the producers of Rust stand to benefit financially from the film. The suggestion that those involved in completing Halyna Hutchins\u2019 film were motivated by profit is disrespectful to those who worked tirelessly to honor her legacy.\u201d",

    "The first phase of work is being carried out at Mossyard\n\nDrivers and residents have shared frustrations over a 96-mile (150km) diversion put in place for an overnight road closure in southern Scotland. Improvement works on the A75 in Dumfries and Galloway mean a stretch of the road will be closed between 20:00 and 06:00 this week, with more work planned at the end of the month. Road maintenance firm Amey said the diversion could take up to two-and-a-half hours but it had done all it could to minimise disruption. People affected have said the closure is \"totally unnecessary\" and was having a major impact.\n\nThe overnight closure takes drivers up towards Ayr and back down\n\nThe A75 between Gretna and Stranraer is the main route across Dumfries and Galloway going to and from the ferry ports at Cairnryan. Work began last week at Mossyard and continues its next phase at Auchenlarie. Overnight closures take place from Monday night until Sunday morning, with more work planned between 28 October and 2 November. It means journeys between Newton Stewart and Castle Douglas - which would normally take about 40 minutes - could take more than four times longer. Among those affected are campaigners against a new national park in the area. Denise Brownlee, of Gatehouse of Fleet, said a recent evening meeting in Castle Douglas had suffered an adverse impact.\n\nCampaigners Denise Brownlee and Liz Hitschmann said they felt total closure was \"totally unnecessary\"\n\n\"A lot of people coming from the west side of Galloway couldn't actually attend because the road closure meant them driving little single track-type roads going home,\" she explained. \"This shows it's putting people off from doing any travelling and attending meetings, no matter how important they are, or basically doing anything in the evening. \"A net result is the meetings we've had planned for Wigtown, Newton Stewart and elsewhere have all had to be cancelled because there's no way in the dark and rain at this time of the year that I'm going to consider driving on some of this narrow track roads. It doesn\u2019t feel safe.\" She said the reality was that even when fully open, the A75 was not fit for purpose due to the volume of traffic and types of vehicles using the route.\n\nLiz Hitschmann, also of Gatehouse of Fleet, campaigns alongside Ms Brownlee and has seen the impact of the closure first hand. She said: \"On the first night that the closure happened, there were no diversion signs in place, so the lorries were queued up all the way from Auchenlarie right the way back to Gatehouse which is some two to three miles. \"And then because the lorries didn\u2019t know where to go they were coming through Gatehouse, which is not really made for lorry traffic, and that in itself caused a lot of problems. \"The fact that they weren\u2019t notified and the signage wasn\u2019t ready, and even now the signage is very small and totally inadequate.\" She said she felt the closures were \"totally unnecessary\" and a convoy system could have been used. Mike Edwards lives on a minor road near the A75 and he said he had seen an increase in drivers using it as an alternative route \"bang-on\" when the road closure started.\n\nMike Edwards lives on a quiet road which often sees increased traffic during road closures\n\n\"The inconvenience to locals is the unusually heavy traffic late into the night, in what is normally a very quiet area when the content of the A75 turns up on your doorstep,\" he said. He said there was also an issue of knowing whether you could get to work as the road could be blocked by a large truck. \"There is wear and tear on our roads, which have little or no maintenance at all,\" he added. \"There has been no signage placed to stop them from using this unusable route for them creating more havoc late into the night.\" Kevin Harris of Donaghadee in Northern Ireland is a regular traveller along the route.\n\n\"We use the road two or three times a month to get to and from the Belfast ferry at Cairnryan,\" he said. \"The diversion is a real pain as other roads around there are often very small. \"We try to take local roads around which often end up in us travelling on very unsuitable roads.\" He said he was planning a trip towing a trailer which might have to see him go the \"long way around\" adding significant time and costs. Pete Barraclough from North Yorkshire said it had affected his recent visit to the Wigtown Book Festival. \"There was no signage on the A75 warning that it would close at 20:00 and no diversion signage when it did,\" he said. \"Eventually figured out a route via New Galloway but added considerably to the journey.\"\n\nAre you affected by the lengthy diversion off the A75?\n\nAmey, which maintains the route on behalf of Transport Scotland, said the work was needed due to the condition of the carriageway. It added that the dates of the work had been decided in consultation with residents and business and would be suspended during the mid-term break for schools. The company said there had been \"extensive discussions\" with ferry operators, the haulage industry and emergency services to mitigate the impact. It said the diversion route had been agreed with stakeholders and had been used for previous work. It added that by working off-peak and overnight it had made \"every attempt\" to reduce disruption but the improvements represented an investment of \u00a3700,000 in the road.",

Zoe Ball: 'It's time to step away from the early alarm call'\n\nZoe Ball has announced she is stepping down as presenter of Radio 2's Breakfast Show in December. Ball said: \u201cAfter six incredible years on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, it\u2019s time for me to step away from the very early mornings and focus on family.\" She will remain on the station, and said more news on what that would involve would be announced in the new year. Ball later announced that Scott Mills will be her replacement, moving from his afternoon show slot on the station. Ball's last show will be on Friday 20 December, \"just in time for Christmas with plenty of fun and shenanigans,\" she told listeners on her Tuesday show.\n\nScott Mills: \"I am beyond excited to be handed the baton\"\n\nTelling her listeners about her decision, she said: \"I've decided it's time to step away from the early alarm call and start a new chapter. \"We\u2019ve shared a hell of a lot, the good times, the tough times, there\u2019s been a lot of laughter. And I am going to miss you cats.\" She added she would also miss her colleagues, saying they were \"like family to me\". The early morning presenter added: \"But I won\u2019t miss the 4am alarm call, if I'm completely honest. \"You know I love you all to bits.\" Mills said: \u201cZoe and I have been such good friends now for over 25 years and have spent much of that time as part of the same radio family here at Radio 2 and also on Radio 1. \"She's done an incredible job on this show over the past six years, and I am beyond excited to be handed the baton.\u201d Speaking on his afternoon show later on Tuesday, Mills told his listeners: \"I can\u2019t thank you enough for how lovely you all were when I took over from Steve (Wright), and I know that you\u2019re going to extend that love to Trevor Nelson. \"Honestly, I can't wait to start with you every morning.\"\n\nBall said she will miss her listeners and colleagues but not getting up early\n\nBall heaped praise on her successor: \u201cScott and I go way back to our Radio 1 days, when he was doing early mornings before me. He\u2019s been a close friend for years, and I\u2019m beyond thrilled it\u2019s him taking over the Breakfast Show. \"Breakfast has always been his dream. He\u2019s not only a blooming brilliant producer but one of the best in radio. I can\u2019t wait to tune in on the school run!\u201d Mills recently stood in for Ball when she took a few weeks off from her show. Trevor Nelson, who currently presents in the evenings Monday to Thursday, will replace Mills as the presenter of the 2pm to 4pm weekday afternoon show from January. Nelson said: \"I'm looking to have lots of fun and will be bringing a bit of soul to the new show.\" Meanwhile, DJ Spoony will extend his weekly edition of The Good Grove (Friday nights - 9-11pm) to four weekly shows on Monday \u2013 Thursday nights and Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s Kitchen Disco will be extended from one to two hours, kicking off on Friday nights at 9pm.\n\nBall hosted the BBC One Saturday morning children's show Live and Kicking in 1997\n\nBall first joined BBC Radio in October 1997 as the co-host of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show with co-presenter Kevin Greening. From October 1998 to March 2000, Zoe hosted the programme solo, the first woman to do so. Helen Thomas, head of Radio 2, said: \"Zoe has woken up the nation on Radio 2 with incredible warmth, wit and so much joy since January 2019. \"I\u2019d like to thank her for approaching each show with as much vim and vigour as if it were her first. I\u2019m thrilled that that she'll remain an important part of the Radio 2 family.\" She was the BBC's highest-paid on-air female presenter in 2023/24. Her salary of between \u00a3950,000 and \u00a3954,999 ranked her second on the list of top-earning talent behind Gary Lineker, according to the corporation's annual report published in July. Many more stars don't make the list, with several of them almost certainly earning more than Ball and Lineker but they are not named because the BBC does not have to disclose the salaries of stars who are paid through production companies. The latest figures from radio industry body Rajar state that Ball's programme is the most listened to breakfast show in the UK. But it dipped by 146,000 listeners to 6.28 million in the most recent quarter, according to industry figures from Rajar. BBC Radio 2 is the UK\u2019s most listened to radio station, with a weekly audience of 13.3 million, the figures show.

    "For the University of Queensland's Monarchist League, King Charles' visit is seen as a celebration\n\nWith a night of bottomless drinks, a three-course dinner and an auction packed with royal memorabilia, the University of Queensland Monarchist League\u2019s annual ball is a sell-out. Billed as a celebration of the Crown, a rendition of God Save The King followed by Australia\u2019s national anthem kicks off the event. When dinner is done, the bidding starts. First up, a limited-edition Royal Doulton plate with a hand-decorated portrait of the King to mark his 60th birthday. Also on the ticket - an oil painting of King George V and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon signed by monarchist and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. For the 200 students and their guests, the fact that King Charles is travelling over 16,000 km (10,000 miles) across 10 different time zones, to tour the country from 18 to 23 October - all while going through cancer treatment - is a testament to his love of Australia. And for that they are grateful. \"He\u2019s such a big part of our history and our traditions, it\u2019s wonderful we get to celebrate it,\" says student Eliza Kingston. \"He\u2019s just as much the King of Australia as he is the King of England,\" Jeremy Bazley adds enthusiastically. But amid a cost-of-living crisis, many Australians have failed to take notice of the trip at all - while some campaigners have tried to frame it as the royal family\u2019s \u201cfarewell tour\u201d, in a bid to reinvigorate the decades-old republican debate. It\u2019s a question that the government has, for now at least, put on ice - while King Charles earlier this week reiterated longstanding palace policy that the matter should be left for the \u201cpublic to decide\u201d.\n\nEliza Kingston says King Charles' visit allows Australia to celebrate its traditions\n\nLast year\u2019s unsuccessful vote on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has stalled momentum for another referendum - which is the only way to change Australia\u2019s constitution. The bruising campaign divided the nation at times, while leaving many of its first inhabitants feeling silenced. It\u2019s a backdrop that will no doubt impact the tone of this royal tour, which includes events in Sydney and Canberra, and is the first in over a decade.\n\nThis will be King Charles's 17th visit to Australia. His first was in 1966, when he came as a teenage prince to spend two terms at Timbertop - a campus of a boarding school in the mountains of Victoria. His time there was, he said, \u201cby far the best\u201d experience of his education. He's since returned 15 times for official tours, including a trip with Princess Diana to one of the country's most famous landmarks, Uluru. Most recently, he opened the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.\n\nKing Charles spent two semesters at Timbertop school in Victoria as a teenager\n\nSo, what sort of welcome will he receive since becoming King? The data suggests the nation is split. A snapshot survey after his coronation, conducted by Roy Morgan Research, indicated 60% of Australians wanted the country to remain a constitutional monarchy. But last year, a poll by YouGov suggested that number had dwindled to 35%, and that 32% of people appeared to favour becoming a republic as soon as possible. A further 12% felt that should only happen when the King died, and 21% just didn\u2019t know. And while just over a third of those questioned thought the monarchy was good for the country, about 20% thought it was bad - while 38% were indifferent.\n\nCharlotte Greatrex (c) and Gus Van Aanholt (left) say younger generations don't have as much of a connection with the monarchy\n\nAt the Royal Hotel Darlington pub, opposite the University of Sydney, students who have finished classes and are headed for a pint had no idea that a visit from the King was imminent. \"To be honest, not that many people would know about it or think too much about it,\" says 19-year-old Charlotte Greatrex. \"We all get very swept up in uni or whatever's going on in our own lives that it doesn't seem to influence us that much.\u201d Her friend Gus Van Aanholt agrees: \"I feel older generations, like my parents and my grandparents, would have much more of a stronger connection to the monarchy.\u201d Polling has often pointed to a generational gap \u2013 indicating increased support for the monarchy among older Australians. Ahead of the King\u2019s visit the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) wants to capitalise on what it sees as a growing indifference to the monarchy. It recently released a tongue-in-cheek media campaign depicting King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales as ageing rock stars delivering their final show, while encouraging people to \u201cwave goodbye to royal reign\u201d. Although a 1999 referendum on becoming a republic was resoundingly defeated, the ARM would like to see the question put to the people again. \"We\u2019ve been independent for a long time now but that last little step of independence for us is splitting away from the monarchy,\" says co-chair Nathan Hansford. \"Regardless of whatever connotations you want to put towards the British royal family in the past, it's really a story about us moving forward as a nation.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has long said Austalia's future is one without a monarchy\n\nWhen the King and Queen fly into Sydney on Friday, they will be greeted by one of Australia's most prominent republicans, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He has long made it clear that his country\u2019s future should be one without a monarchy. He even appointed an assistant minister for the republic. But in recent months, a cabinet reshuffle and the removal of the republican portfolio revealed that plans to hold a vote on the issue had been shelved. Like much of the world, Australians are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of everyday essentials, and the government knows it's not going to win a referendum when there isn't the appetite for what many would see as an expensive distraction. In short, Albanese has assessed that a republican vote is not a priority for the general public right now.\n\nAllira Davis, co-chair of the Uluru Youth Dialogue, says Australia still has to grapple with the ongoing impacts of its colonial past\n\nFor their part, many Indigenous Australians feel last year\u2019s referendum result was a clear indication the country still has a lot of work to do to grapple with the ongoing impacts of its colonial past, before it can debate its future. \u201cI think if we do end up going to another referendum, we have to make sure that we deal with First Nations issues\u2026 we still have people experiencing intergenerational trauma, so understanding the history of what has happened in this country is really key,\u201d says Allira Davis, a Cobble Cobble woman and co-chair of the Uluru Youth Dialogue. She\u2019s proud, though, of how much more diverse the nation has become, since King Charles first touched down as a 17-year-old. \"We're not white Australia anymore, we're a brown Australia. \"We have multicultural, diverse backgrounds coming from all nations, and it'd be very interesting to see a brown head of state, or a black head of state but before we do that, we need to include our First Nations and recognise that.\"",
    "Somebody moved UK's oldest satellite, and no-one knows who or why\n\nArtwork: The half-tonne Skynet-1A satellite was launched in November 1969\n\nSomeone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why. Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces. When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean. But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.\n\nOrbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location. Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose? It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago. \"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves. \"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis. \"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.\n\nIf a satellite died at 40E it would drift to the nearest gravity well, which is 75E.\n\nDr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft. It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise. But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.\n\nWhat we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket. \"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation. This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire. \"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me. \"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.\n\nCould the command to move Skynet-1A have come from the US Air Force's 'Blue Cube'?\n\nRachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives. Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility. \"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated. The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977. But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\". This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites. Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.\n\nBritish engineers are developing technologies to snare defunct satellites in low orbits\n\nAttitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested. At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day. That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort. The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.\n\nThe Americans have already shown it's possible to grab a high-orbiting satellite\n\nUltimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location. Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space. Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A. \"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. \"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",
    "Macron calls to halt arms deliveries to Israel in Gaza war\n\nMacron speaks during a press conference at the 19th Francophonie Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza on Saturday, prompting swift criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron told France Inter radio that \"the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza\". At a summit in Paris, the French president reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza continuing despite ceasefire calls, and he also criticised Israel's decision to send ground troops into Lebanon. Netanyahu quickly pushed back but during a telephone call between the two leaders on Sunday, Macron reiterated France's \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel.\n\nIn a video earlier released by his office, Netanyahu said \"Israel will win with orwithout their support\", adding that calling for an arms embargo was \"a disgrace\". \"Shame on them,\" he said, referring to Macron and other Western leaders who have called for what he described as an arms embargo on Israel. Macron, in an interview with the French broadcaster which was recorded on Tuesday and aired on Saturday, said \"France is not delivering any\" weapons to Israel. He added: \"I think we are not being heard.\" \"I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,\" he said, adding that the conflict was leading to \"hatred\". Macron also said that avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a \"priority\" and that \"Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza\". Netanyahu's office responded by saying that any country that did not stand with Israel was supporting Iran and its allies and proxies. Netanyahu said: \"As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side. \"Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them.\" Macron's office later said that France is a \"steadfast friend of Israel\", adding that Netanyahu's reaction was \"excessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel\".\n\nSpeaking in Paris on Saturday, Macron said that while both the US and France had called for a ceasefire in Lebanon, he added: \"I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil.\" However, Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence and said that he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza on Monday. During a telephone conversation on Sunday, Netanyahu told the French President that Israel's fight against the Hezbollah group would help \"change the reality\" in Lebanon and bring stability to the entire Middle East, a statement from his office said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s friends are expected to stand behind it, and not impose restrictions on it that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil,\u201d Netanyahu was reported to have said during their call. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his country's \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel's security, according to his office. Monday will mark the first anniversary of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\u2022 None Where does Israel get its weapons?\n\u2022 None How could Israel respond, and what might Iran do then?\n\u2022 None Israeli kibbutz struggles to heal, one year after 7 October",
    "Yusely Perez says she was forced to collect firewood to burn for cooking\n\nCuba has endured one of its toughest weeks in years after a nationwide blackout which left around 10 million Cubans without power for several days. Adding to the Caribbean island\u2019s problems, Hurricane Oscar left a trail of destruction along the north-eastern coast, leaving several dead and causing widespread damage. For some communities in Cuba the energy crisis is the new normal. As Cuba approached its fourth day without power this week, Yusely Perez turned to the only fuel source left available to her: firewood. Her neighbourhood in Havana hasn\u2019t received its regular deliveries of liquified gas cannisters for two months. So once the island\u2019s entire electrical grid went down, prompting a nationwide blackout, Yusely was forced to take desperate measures. \u201cMe and my husband went all over the city, but we couldn\u2019t find charcoal anywhere,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe had to collect firewood wherever we found it on the street. Thankfully it was dry enough to cook with.\u201d Yusely nodded at the yucca chips frying slowly in a pot of lukewarm oil. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone two days without eating,\u201d she adds.\n\nCuba's energy infrastructure needs more investment, economists say\n\nSpeaking last Sunday, at the height of what was Cuba\u2019s most acute energy crisis in years, the country\u2019s energy and mines minister, Vicente de la O Levy, blamed the problems for the country\u2019s creaking electrical infrastructure on what he called the \u201cbrutal\u201d US economic embargo on Cuba. The embargo, he argued, made it impossible to import new parts to overhaul the grid or bring in enough fuel to run the power stations, even to access credit in the international banking system. The US State Department retorted that the problems with energy production in Cuba did not lie at Washington\u2019s door - but argued that it was due to the Cuban government\u2019s own mismanagement. Normal service would be resumed soon, the Cuban minister insisted. But no sooner did he utter those words than there was another total collapse of the grid, the fourth in 48 hours. At night, the full extent of the blackout became clear. Havana\u2019s streets were plunged into near total darkness as residents sat on the doorsteps in the stifling heat, their faces lit up by their mobile phones \u2013 as long as their batteries lasted.\n\nResidents of Havana were without electricity at night\n\nSome, like restaurant worker Victor, were prepared to openly criticise the authorities. \u201cThe people who run this country are the ones who have all the answers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to have to explain themselves to the Cuban people.\u201d Specifically, the state\u2019s decision to invest heavily in tourism, rather than energy infrastructure, frustrated him most during the blackout. \u201cThey\u2019ve built so many hotels in the past few years. Everyone knows that a hotel doesn\u2019t cost a couple of bucks. It costs 300 or 400 million dollars.\u201d \u201cSo why is our energy infrastructure collapsing?\u201d he asks. \u201cEither they\u2019re not investing in it or, if they are, then it\u2019s not been to the benefit of the people.\u201d Aware of the growing discontentment, President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on state TV wearing the traditional olive-green fatigues of the Cuban revolution. If that message wasn\u2019t clear enough, he directly warned people against protesting over the blackout. The authorities would not \u201ctolerate\u201d vandalism, he said, or any attempt to \u201cdisrupt the social order\u201d.\n\nPeople were lit up by their mobile phones as they sat outside in the heat\n\nThe protests of July 2021, when hundreds were arrested amid widespread demonstrations following a series of blackouts, were fresh in the memory. On this occasion, there were only a handful of reports of isolated incidents. Yet the question of where Cuba chooses to direct its scarce resources remains a real point of contention on the island. \u201cWhen we talk about energy infrastructure, that refers to both generation and distribution or transmission. In every step, a lot of investment is needed,\u201d says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres, at the American University in Washington DC. Electricity generation in Cuba has recently fallen well below what\u2019s required, only supplying some 60-70% of the national demand. The shortfall is a \u201chuge and serious gap\u201d which is now being felt across the island, says Mr Torres. By the government\u2019s own figures, Cuba\u2019s national electricity generation dropped by around 2.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, part of a downward trend which has seen a staggering 25% drop in production since 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that last week\u2019s problem in the energy grid isn\u2019t something that happens overnight,\u201d says Mr Torres.\n\nMarbeyis Aguilera says she has had no power for six days\n\nFew know that better than Marbeyis Aguilera. The 28-year-old mother-of-three is getting used to living without electricity. For Marbeyis, even \u201cnormal service\u201d being restored still means most of the day without power. In fact, what the residents of Havana endured for a few days is what daily life is like in her village of Aguacate in the province of Artemisa, outside Havana. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no power for six days\u201d, she says, brewing coffee on a makeshift charcoal stove inside her breeze-block, tin-roofed shack. \u201cIt came on for a couple of hours last night and then went out again. We have no choice but to cook like this or use firewood to provide something warm for the children,\u201d she adds. Her two gas hobs and one electric ring sit idle on the kitchen top, the room filling with smoke. The community is in dire need of state assistance, she says, listing their most urgent priorities. \u201cFirst, electricity. Secondly, we need water. Food is running out. People with dollars, sent from abroad, can buy food. But we don\u2019t have any so we can\u2019t buy anything.\u201d\n\nMarbeyis cooks for her three daughters using a basic stove\n\nMarbeyis says some of the main problems in Aguacate \u2013 food insecurity and water distribution \u2013 have been exacerbated by the power cuts. Her husband\u2019s manual labour also requires electricity and he\u2019s stuck at home waiting for the instruction to come to work. The Cuban Government was due to recall state workers by Thursday \u2013 but to avoid another collapse in the grid, all non-essential work and schools have now been suspended until next week. \u201cIt\u2019s especially hard on the children\u201d, Marbeyis adds, her eyes tearing up, \u201cbecause when they say I want this or that, we have nothing to give them.\u201d Living without a reliable energy source is the new normal in places like Aguacate. Many have been struggling with power shortages since around the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which coincided with a sharp economic downturn on the island.\n\nIn Marbeyis' home village of Aguacate there is not a reliable electricity supply\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem for the Cuban State is that the sight of people cooking with firewood and charcoal in the 21st Century is reminiscent of the poverty under dictator Fulgencio Bastista, who the revolutionaries ousted six-and-half decades ago. Amid it all, on the north-eastern coast, the situation got even worse. As people were still coping with the blackout, Hurricane Oscar made landfall, bringing high winds, flash flooding and ripping roofs from homes. The storm may have passed. But Cubans know that such is the precarious state of the island\u2019s energy infrastructure that the next nationwide blackout could come at any time.",
    "Leicestershire Police has issued CCTV images of two men officers wish to speak to\n\nPolice have launched a CCTV appeal after three armed robberies at supermarkets in Leicestershire. The incidents, which are reported to have involved a gun, took place in Wigston on Thursday, Evington on Friday and Enderby on Saturday. A 40-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery, Leicestershire Police said. The force also released images of two men officers would like to speak to as part of the investigation.\n\nAccording to police, the first robbery happened at Tesco in Blaby Road at about 23:55 BST on Thursday, while the second took place a day later at Tesco in Ethel Road at about 21:40. The third was reported at Sainsbury's near Fosse Park at about 09:25 on Saturday. In all three incidents, two men entered the stores at separate times before trying to leave without paying for bottles of alcohol, police said. When challenged by staff, threats were made with a gun before the suspects reportedly left with bottles of alcohol.\n\nA knife was also used during the incident at the Sainsbury's store, police added, but no serious injuries have been reported following the robberies. Det Insp George Fraser said: \"We are treating these incidents as a priority in force and our investigation and enquiries are very much ongoing. \u201cWe are looking to speak to the men pictured and urge anyone who recognises them to make contact with us immediately. \u201cIf you see the men, please do not approach them but please contact 999 immediately.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester",

PC Huw Orphan, 32, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm at Cardiff Crown Court. He denied attacking Amy Burley, who also worked for Gwent Police, at their home in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, in 2020, claiming he accidentally caught her with his leg after a row and was cleared of a more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Earlier this month, he was banned from joining any police force during a misconduct hearing by the Gwent force, which said he would have been dismissed immediately if he had not resigned shortly beforehand.\n\nIn an impact statement read to the court, Ms Burley said she had been left with frequent pain and mobility issues. \"I'm unable to sit or stand for a long period of time and I have a very poor and irregular sleep pattern,\" she said. \"I was unable to perform simple activities with my children, such as playing and having fun. \"After six months of sick leave, I went off on unpaid leave which has affected me and my family financially. I\u2019m constantly drained by the whole thing.\"\n\nJudge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said: \"This was a grave injury, as demonstrated not only by the injury itself, but by her personal statement, which shows she is still significantly affected more than four years after the incident.\" The jury was told the couple met in 2017 while working for Gwent Police and got married two years later.

    "Abida Sultaan was the eldest daughter of the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan\n\nAbida Sultaan was nothing like your typical princess. She wore her hair short, shot tigers and was an ace polo player. She flew planes and drove herself around in a Rolls-Royce from the age of nine. Born in 1913 into a family of brave 'begums' (a Muslim woman of high rank) who ruled the northern princely state of Bhopal in British India for over a century, Abida continued their legacy of defying stereotypes around women in general and Muslim women in particular. She refused to be in purdah - a practice followed by Muslim, and some Hindu women, of wearing clothes that conceal them and secluding themselves from men - and became heir to the throne at the age of 15. Abida ran her father's cabinet for more than a decade, rubbed shoulders with India's prominent freedom fighters and would eventually come to have a ringside view of the hate and violence the country disintegrated into after it was partitioned in 1947 to create Pakistan. She was groomed from a young age to take on the mantle of ruler under the guidance of her grandmother, Sultan Jehan, a strict disciplinarian who was the ruler of Bhopal. In her 2004 autobiography, Memoirs of a Rebel Princess, Abida writes about how she had to wake up at four in the morning to read the Quran - the religious text of Islam - and then proceed with a day filled with activities, which included learning sports, music and horse riding, but also included chores like sweeping the floor and cleaning bathrooms. \"We girls were not allowed to feel any inferiority on account of our sex. Everything was equal. We had all the freedom that a boy had; we could ride, climb trees, play any game we chose to. There were no restrictions,\" she said in an interview about her childhood. Abida had a fierce, independent streak even as a child and rebelled against her grandmother when she forced her into purdah at the age of 13. Her chutzpah coupled with her father's broad-mindedness helped her escape the practice for the rest of her life. Already heir to the throne of Bhopal, Abida stood the chance of becoming part of the royal family of the neighbouring princely state of Kurwai as well when at the age of 12, she was married off to Sarwar Ali Khan, her childhood friend and ruler Kurwai. She described her nikah (wedding), about which she was clueless, in hilarious detail in her memoir. She writes about how one day, while she was pillow-fighting with her cousins, her grandmother walked into the room and asked her to dress up for a wedding. Only, no one told her that she was the bride. \"No-one had prepared or instructed me on how to conduct myself, with the result that I walked into the nikah chamber, pushing the gathered women out of my way, my face uncovered, sulking as usual for being chosen again for some new experiment,\" she writes. The wedding was brief like Abida's marriage, which lasted for less than a decade.\n\nAbida was an accomplished polo player and marksman\n\nMarried life was difficult for Abida, not just because of her young age but also because of her strict, pious upbringing. She candidly describes how a lack of knowledge and discomfort with sex took a toll on her marriage. \"Immediately after my wedding, I entered the world of conjugal trauma. I had not realised that the consummation that followed would leave me so horrified, numbed and feeling unchaste,\" she writes and adds that she could never bring herself to \"accept marital relations between husband and wife\". This led to the breakdown of her marriage. In her paper, external on intimacy and sexuality in the autobiographical writings of Muslim women in South Asia, historian Siobhan Lambert-Hurley underscores how Abida's honest reflections on sexual intimacy with her husband tear apart the stereotype that Muslim women do not write about sex, by presenting an unabashed voice on the topic. After her marriage fell apart, Abida left her marital home in Kurwai and moved back to Bhopal. But the couple's only son, Shahryar Mohammad Khan, became the subject of an ugly custody dispute. Frustrated by the drawn-out battle and not wanting to part with her son, Abida took a bold step to make her husband back off. On a warm night in March 1935, Abida drove for three hours straight to reach her husband's home in Kurwai. She entered his bedroom, pulled out a revolver, threw it in her husband's lap and said: \"Shoot me or I will shoot you.\" This incident, coupled with a physical confrontation between the couple in which Abida emerged victorious, put an end to the custody dispute. She proceeded to raise her son as a single mother while juggling her duties as heir to the throne. She ran her state's cabinet from 1935 till 1949, when Bhopal was merged with the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Abida also attended the round-table conferences - called by the British government to decide the future government of India - during which she met influential leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Motilal Nehru and his son, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was to become India's first prime minister. She also experienced first-hand the deteriorating relationship between Hindus and Muslims and the violence that broke out in the aftermath of India's partition in 1947.\n\nIn her memoir Abida describes the discrimination she began facing in Bhopal; how her family, who had lived there peacefully for generations, began to be treated as \"outsiders\". In one of her interviews, external, she spoke about a particularly disturbing memory she had of the violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims. One day, after the Indian government informed her that a train carrying Muslim refugees would arrive in Bhopal, she went to the railway station to supervise the arrival. \"When the compartments were opened, they were all dead,\" she said and added that it was this violence and distrust that drove her to move to Pakistan in 1950. Abida left quietly, with only her son and hopes for a brighter future. In Pakistan, she championed democracy and women's rights through her political career. Abida died in Karachi in 2002. After she left for Pakistan, the Indian government had made her sister heir to the throne. But Abida is still known in Bhopal, where people refer to her by her nickname 'bia huzoor'. \"Religious politics over the past few years have chipped away at her legacy and she isn't spoken about as much any more,\" says journalist Shams Ur Rehman Alavi, who has been researching Bhopal's women rulers. \"But her name isn't likely to be forgotten anytime soon.\"",

Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile, who was also a former Belfast lord mayor, confirmed police were notified but no formal complaint was received. Mary Lou McDonald said, following a referral by Sinn F\u00e9in, there were no findings of illegality and no criminal charges were pursued. She has come under pressure over the party's handling of recent child safeguarding issues.\n\nMr \u00d3 Donnghaile confirmed in a statement to the Irish News, external, external on Tuesday that he sent an inappropriate text to a youth member of the party, a 17-year-old boy in Northern Ireland. The message is believed to have been personal in nature but not sexually explicit.\n\nThe party said when it got the complaint in September 2023, it followed its child protection policy, suspended Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile, and referred them to police and the social services. The same month, Sinn F\u00e9in said the PSNI told them it was not carrying out an investigation. Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile later resigned from the party. On Tuesday, McDonald said a second person, an adult, had also received inappropriate texts from Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile and was advised of their right to make a complaint but they did not. In his statement to the Irish News, Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile said he accepted his behaviour warranted stepping down from his role in the Seanad and as a party member. He said it would give him \"the space to focus on improving\" his health and well-being, issues he added he had been dealing with since 2021. BBC News NI has contacted him for comment.\n\nMary Lou McDonald made a statement in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday\n\nIn a statement at the time, Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile said he had been unable to attend the Seanad since the summer recess \"on the advice of my doctor\". At the time, McDonald issued a statement thanking him for his service to the party. During a debate on Tuesday, she repeated that he had previously been on leave due to \"serious mental health issues\". \"We were advised at the time he stepped down he was suffering from a mental health crisis after the complaint and was deemed medically unfit for work,\" McDonald said. \"We were worried publicly naming him would be dangerous to his health and we had very serious concerns for his health and safety - I still hold some to this day.\"\n\nIn a social media post reacting to the news on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said when Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile stepped down his party \"enabled a graceful departure\" but \"they knew the real reason\". \"The contempt and apparent cover up continues,\" he added. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party have called for First Minister Michelle O'Neill to give a statement to the assembly on the issue. T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy PM) and Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said the latest revelations about Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile \"raise serious and fundamental questions about the party and its governance\". He claimed the Oireachtas was \"misled on the full reasons\" for his resignation. \"It is apparent when it comes to Sinn F\u00e9in, the party always comes first,\" he said.\n\nThese controversies may have different complexities and timelines, but they all raise questions of accountability and transparency. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s political rivals will be lining up to ask who knew what and when. And in particular, the focus will be on how Sinn F\u00e9in dealt with those issues which related to child safeguarding. Sinn F\u00e9in will hope McDonald setting out in full the party\u2019s actions will help take the heat out of recent weeks.

The party faced criticism after it emerged that two Sinn F\u00e9in press officers gave references for their former colleague for a job with a charity. In September, McMonagle admitted to a series of offences, including attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity. He is due to be sentenced in the coming weeks. Both press officers, Se\u00e1n Mag Uidhir and Caol\u00e1n McGinley, have since resigned. On this, McDonald said she has instigated an overhaul of procedures in the party. Speaking in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday, McDonald also reiterated that the move by two former press officers to provide Michael McMonagle with job references when he was under investigation for child sex offences was \"reprehensible and unforgivable\". She said Mag Uidhir and McGinley \"knew their actions were sackable offences so they jumped before they were pushed\".

    "Alex Salmond loved creating headlines. He would be disappointed if he gave an interview that was not sufficiently interesting to make the news. As a young radio journalist, I was sent to see him at a business breakfast event where at that time he was demanding the UK join the single European currency. When I suggested this was not new, that he\u2019d said it many times before, he said: \u201cYes but I\u2019m saying it more forcefully now because the case is more urgent.\u201d Anything to make his contribution count. Spending time in his company could easily make you late. He tended not to limit interview duration and enjoyed further conversation, debate and showing off a bit after the microphones were off.\n\nI can remember interviewing him in his early days as first minister at his official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh. The interview was over and I needed to go - but he wanted to show me a collection of silverware that had been found in a cupboard, and share something of its history. While he could be charming and entertaining and always offered a sharp analysis of the politics of the day, there was also a less pleasant side to his character. I would wince when sometimes he would show impatience and irritation towards his staff. He could be very demanding of them. I can also remember bringing a senior BBC editor from the newsroom in London to see him, and was astonished when he asked my colleague if he was on a colonial visit.\n\nAlex Salmond and Alistair Darling took part in a debate chaired by Glenn Campbell ahead of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014\n\nHe had a love/hate relationship with the BBC. He loved when he was offered a prestigious spot on a network show like Question Time, especially when his political career was in decline. At other times, he would rage against output he did not like. He was not happy that I interviewed, anonymously, one of the women who had accused him of sexual offences in court, after he had been acquitted of all charges. It was not an attempt to re-try the case but a response to his claims of a political conspiracy. I am not sure he forgave me for that. I travelled with him to Europe, the United States and China. I remember him turning up uncharacteristically early at the Forbidden City in Beijing to meet China\u2019s vice-premier and finding himself locked out. It would have made powerful TV footage but I don\u2019t think we got it on camera. He thought we had captured this embarrassing moment and gave me a private briefing and a couple of scoops in the hope I wouldn\u2019t use it.\n\nAlex Salmond lived and breathed politics and he seemed completely lost when he was ejected from parliament in 2017. I bumped into him in Edinburgh soon after and we shared a taxi to Waverley station. Naturally we talked politics and when it came time to part he just kept the conversation going. In recent years, we talked far less. He refused to take part in a podcast series I made about Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s time in office - which would obviously have included the spectacular rift between them. That was not like him. In all my previous experience, he rarely missed a media opportunity. Better in his view to get out there and make his case rather than shy away and let others set the narrative.",
    "Man dies after tree falls on car as Storm Bert sweeps UK\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA man has died after a tree fell on his car as Storm Bert brought strong winds, rain, and snow and caused disruption across the UK. Hampshire Police said a man in his 60s died after a tree hit his car on the A34 near Winchester early on Saturday morning. Road, rail, and air passengers all saw delays and cancellations, while thousands of homes have been left without power. Yellow weather warnings for rain and wind are in place across the UK, as well as dozens of flood warnings in England, Wales and Scotland. Meteorologists have described it as a multi-hazard storm.\n\nIn England, snowfall caused the closure of a number of A-roads, while a number of rail companies - including Northern Rail and Avanti West Coast - were forced to cancel dozens of services. Two other people died on Saturday in crashes on the roads during the stormy weather, one in West Yorkshire and another in Northamptonshire - although it is not known if they were directly related to the conditions. A major search and rescue operation was launched in Sidmouth, Devon, after members of the public spotted an object in a river. Newcastle Airport and Leeds Bradford Airport both saw numerous flights delayed, although both later said they were operating as normal. National Highways issued a severe weather alert for snow on roads in Yorkshire and north-east England in anticipation of blizzard conditions and said snow would \"accumulate quickly at all levels\". Scotland was hit by even more snow than anticipated on Saturday, causing long traffic jams and multiple road closures. Lothian buses suspended all of its 70 routes across Edinburgh and surrounding areas, and there were delays and cancellations to ScotRail services. The Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth was closed due to the threat of falling ice. A number of Scottish football matches were also affected. The kick-off of Rangers' afternoon game against Dundee United was pushed back by 45 minutes following travel issues, while at least two Scottish Championship games have been called off altogether. Earlier snow has given way to rain for many, but that the threat of disruption is not yet over.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Flooding after snowfall turns to water in Cumbria\n\nTim Robertson, 58, who lives in Coniston Waterhead, Cumbria, sent the BBC footage of an area in which overnight snowfall had quickly melted and left a road waterlogged. \"We woke up to about four inches of snow,\" he said. \u201cSince then, the snow has been melting and, with the rain as well, there\u2019s been a lot of water. \u201cWe went out for a walk in the woods and when we came back, that particular stretch of road was flooded. Cars were still getting through. I\u2019m not sure how wise that was.\"\n\u2022 None How do storms like Bert get their names? He added that some of the roads had since cleared. Early on Sunday, a total of 49 floods warnings remain in force in England, mostly around the northwest, while 160 alerts are in force across the southwest, Midlands, and northwest. As of 19:00 GMT on Saturday, the National Grid said 1,186 homes in Wales and 819 in south-west England were without power, though both figures were down from earlier in the day.\n\nThe most affected parts of south Wales were expected to see up to 150mm of rainfall on Saturday, equivalent to the average rainfall for the whole of November in just a day. Natural Resources Wales said there was flooding to low-lying areas in parts of Carmarthenshire near the River Loughor, with river levels set to rise and flooding of property expected. In Denbighshire, north Wales, five adults and five children were rescued from a house following a landslide. Sixteen flood warnings and 51 flood alerts are in force in areas across the country. Winds from Storm Bert strengthened on Saturday morning, with top gusts of 82mph recorded at Capel Curig (Conwy) and 75mph at Needles, an exposed site on the western tip of the Isle of Wight. In Scotland, the Cairngorm mountains saw blizzard conditions and winds of up to 105mph. Strong winds also forced the closure of the Severn Bridge, which connects Gloucestershire and south Wales. Ferry companies were also affected. Operator CalMac - which serves the west coast of Scotland - cancelled several services, while P&O Ferries cancelled one service and Irish Ferries cancelled numerous crossings to Wales. The charity that maintains London's royal parks, which include Hype Park and Kensington Gardens, said all eight would be closed on Sunday and have delayed openings on Monday because of concerns about severe wind gusts.\n\nAreas of Ireland were also hit by flooding, with the west of the country appearing to be worst-affected. At one point, 60,000 customers across the country were left without power.\n\nHow have you been affected by the snow and ice?",

    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nTen-year-old Sara Sharif suffered injuries which were comparable to a person involved in a car crash, a court has heard. The girl's body, which was found in her family's home in Surrey last year, had signs of healing spinal fractures which had then been rebroken, the Old Bailey was told. Her father Urfan Sharif, 42, stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder. Jurors previously heard the girl had been hooded, burned, bitten and beaten during more than two years of abuse.\n\nGiving evidence, paediatric radiologist Prof Owen Arthurs told the court that spinal fractures were \u201cvery rare\u201d and usually caused by high impact or high speed trauma, such as road traffic incidents. He also told jurors that Sara\u2019s neck injuries were \u201cextremely rare\u201d. \u201cThe most likely cause is manual strangulation with a degree of force above that which we would normally recognise in ligature force, like hanging,\" he told the court.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nThe court previously heard that Sara had suffered puncture wounds, burns, bruising and abrasions, and a post-mortem examination found Sara had \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC previously said a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. The court also previously heard Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Sara's five brothers and sisters on 9 August 2023, the day before her body was found. Prosecutors said Mr Sharif called police from Pakistan and admitted he killed Sara about an hour after his family\u2019s flight had landed in Islamabad. Jurors were told Mr Sharif's case was that Ms Batool was responsible for Sara's death, and he made a false confession on the phone call and also in a note to protect his wife. The three defendants, who lived with Sara in Woking before her death, are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they deny.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "British Airways passengers were left stranded on the tarmac in multiple airports in the UK and internationally after a \"technical issue\" disrupted operations. The problems, which the airline says have now been solved, started at around 17:00 on Monday, with passengers posting on social media that they were standing in the cold waiting to find out what was happening to their flights. BA said a problem that affected some of its computer systems had caused the delays. \"We\u2019ve apologised to customers for delays to their flights and ensured they were able to reach their destinations as planned,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nIn an earlier update on the disruption, the company said no flights had been cancelled. Downdetector, a website that logs complaints with websites that are not working, indicated a sharp increase in problems with the BA site after 17:00. It is not clear how widespread the disruption was, but it was reported to have affected flights globally, as well as some domestic UK flights. Travel expert and journalist Simon Calder estimated the problems could have affected tens of thousands of passengers, although the delays seemed to be limited to one or two hours for affected flights. One passenger wrote on X that they were \"being made to stand on the tarmac in a very cold Verona waiting for an already delayed flight\".

Payne died, aged 31, after falling from the third floor of hotel balcony in Argentina on Wednesday. Malik was about to start the US leg of his tour next week - starting with a show in San Francisco on Wednesday. However, the singer told fans he was postponing the shows - saying: \"Given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week, I've made the decision to postpone the US leg of the Stairway to the Sky Tour.\"\n\nThe US part of Malik's tour was due to also visit Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, ending in New York on 3 November.

The 31-year-old did not mention the 11 dates of the UK leg of his tour, which are expected to run from 20 November to 4 December. On Thursday, Malik paid tribute to Payne, saying he would \"cherish all the memories I have with you in my heart forever\". \"I lost a brother when you left us and can't explain to you what I'd give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly,\" he said.\n\nZayn Malik said he would \"cherish all the memories\" with Liam Payne\n\nPayne and Malik rose to global fame as part of the boyband One Direction - created on The X Factor TV show in 2010 - and sang together with bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and Niall Horan.

    "Several front pages reflect on the UK's decision to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The Financial Times describes it as \"Historic accord\", but the Daily Mail says critics have called the deal \"shameful\", summarising with the headline \"Starmer's surrender\".\n\nThe Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer received private warnings from the United States about the deal and there were concerns among officials that it could benefit China, an ally of Mauritius, a claim denied by government insiders.\n\nIn its editorial, the Daily Telegraph has described the move as a \"national scandal\", labelling it a \"giveaway\". The Mirror disagrees, saying ministers have \"finally put right one of the last remaining wrongs from British colonial rule\". In its coverage, the Guardian focuses on the reaction of Chagossians.\n\nThe paper says not everyone is happy sovereignty has been passed to Mauritius but it quotes one campaigner who says the deal is a \"recognition of the injustice done against those who were forced to leave their homes\".\n\nThe I says UK scientists are working on a vaccine to \"wipe out ovarian cancer within five years\". The jab, which is being created by researchers at Oxford University, works by teaching the immune system to recognise and attack the earliest stages of the cancer. The paper says there are hopes it could be given to women preventively on the NHS, \"with the aim of eliminating the disease\".\n\nThe Mirror also covers the story, with the headline \"scientists aim for world first\".\n\nBoris Johnson has told the Telegraph he believes Britain needs a referendum on its membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. The former prime minister says there's a \"strong case\" to give the public a say on the matter. He also suggests the ECHR doesn't \"provide people with protections they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have\u201d.\n\nMany of the papers have picked up on Prince William saying he didn't attend this summer's Olympics in Paris because he didn't want to risk bringing Covid home to his wife during her cancer treatment. \"Wills Olympic virus fear\" says the Sun, while \"Prince missed Paris to keep Kate safe\" is the Times' take.\n\nHe made the comments yesterday while meeting some of Britain's Olympic and Paralympic swimmers.

    "'You\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it' - how John Prescott inspired Angela Rayner\n\nJohn Prescott, who has died aged 86, was a figurehead of New Labour, who was also instinctively sceptical of some of its instincts. He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off. His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre. He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together. It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer. Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged. Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC, external: \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\" She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\" Speaking to broadcasters after news of his death, Rayner said he had been \"a huge support to me ever since I came into politics\", offering the advice to \"be authentically yourself and keep thinking about the people you\u2019re there to represent\". She added: \"That\u2019s what he always said to me, 'you\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it'\".\n\nBoth left school with few qualifications and worked their way up through the union movement, before entering politics. And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use. Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them. And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for. The old jibe that all politicians look and sound the same could never apply to Prescott or Rayner. Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life. For all the talk about how he was the authentic working class grit in the smooth, polished very middle class New Labour, that sense of his class \u2013 \u201cbottom class\u201d as he put it \u2013 and others was a huge part of how he saw himself, and how he saw others. If you have a moment today, I recommend listening to this wonderful documentary on BBC Sounds \u2013 Prescott At Your Service - which tells the story of a 19-year-old John Prescott working as a waiter on an ocean liner to New Zealand, where the future deputy prime minister would serve the recently resigned former prime minister Anthony Eden. Decades later, Tony Blair would reflect that Prescott\u2019s own self image was an ever present in his daily interactions in government. \u201cHe could smell out condescension, a slight, an air of superiority or a snub at a thousand paces; and at once smelt, he could charge after it with quite shocking abandon.\u201d John Prescott was the conduit between Labour\u2019s past and its present. He was, as well, the glue binding Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, whose pivotal but at times dysfunctional relationship defined the first decade of Labour\u2019s stint in power between 1997 and 2010. And he illustrated a path to the near pinnacle of power for those whose backgrounds still rarely lead to the top table of British politics.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "US actor's dream to own ancestral home is in ruins\n\nHopwood DePree said he had spent seven years trying to realise his dream of owning his ancestral home\n\nA US actor's dream of restoring his ancestral home to its former glory has been left in ruins after the council that owns the 15th Century manor house pulled out of the deal. Hopwood DePree swapped Los Angeles for Rochdale in 2017 after discovering Grade II-listed Hopwood Hall in Middleton had been in his family for about 400 years. However, the 54-year-old, who said he had spent about \u00a3580,000 renovating the dilapidated 60-room country house, claimed Rochdale Borough Council had \"pulled the rug from under him\" by ending its agreement to sell it to him. The council said Mr DePree did not have a \"viable\" plan for the future of the building.\n\nMr DePree, who is originally from Michigan, said he had been told stories about Hopwood Hall by his grandfather when he was a boy. He had assumed the stories about the house - where Guy Fawkes and Lord Byron are reported to have stayed and which remained in the Hopwood family until World War One - were just fairy tales. But when he found out about the family connection he decided to try to buy the building and turn it into an arts and events centre. Rochdale Council gave him a \"limited licence to occupy\" and the option to buy the building. About \u00a31.7m in grants from the council and heritage bodies like Historic England have been invested in repairs and renovations since 2017.\n\nHopwood DePree said he had invested about \u00a3580,000 of his own money in reviving Hopwood Hall\n\nPlanning permission for Mr DePree's scheme was granted in 2022, the same year he wrote Downton Shabby, which chronicled his efforts to revive the manor. He said he believed he had viable plans for the future of the building, and had been talking to hotel and restaurant firms about his idea of running hospitality skills training there. But he was shocked to discover that, at a meeting held behind closed doors last week, the council had decided to back out of the arrangement.\n\nHopwood Hall has been derelict for much of the last 20 years\n\nMr DePree said under the council's ownership the building had been derelict for years. He said: \"The council took the hall over in the 1990s and in these last 20-plus years, it has fallen into complete dereliction, so for us to reverse that and restore the building to its former glory was an incredible challenge.\" Mr DePree, who directed and starred in the 1999 comedy The Last Big Attraction, said the council had told him that because the hall is completely surrounded by Hopwood Hall college's grounds, it needed its own independent access road. He said he had been looking into how to build that when the council decided it no longer wanted to go ahead with the deal. Mr DePree, who believed the deal to be legally binding, said he wanted details of the reason for the council's decision before deciding on his next move. But his lawyers have said they believe the council should honour the agreement to sell because, they said, the only condition was that planning permission was secured.\n\nAn artist's impression of how the Long Gallery at Hopwood Hall might look after renovation\n\nRochdale Borough Council said it had agreed to sell the building to Mr DePree for a \"nominal fee\" if he could come up with a viable business plan, and had renewed and extended the agreement several times. But this week the cabinet had decided not to renew it again after consultants it commissioned said Mr DePree's plans were \"unlikely to be able to secure future public or private funding\".

    "Eva Longoria says her family no longer lives in 'dystopian' US\n\nThe Desperate Housewives star is considered a power broker in Democratic politics\n\nHollywood actress Eva Longoria has revealed that her family no longer lives in the United States, and is splitting time between Mexico and Spain. In an interview with French magazine Marie Claire for its November cover story, Longoria attributed the decision to the country's \"changing vibe\" after the Covid-19 pandemic, homelessness and high taxation in California, and the re-election of Donald Trump. She also acknowledged she was \"privileged\" enough to move, saying: \u201cMost Americans aren\u2019t so lucky.

    "Rape centre breaks away from charity in row over gender\n\nA rape support centre in Glasgow has broken away from the supervision of the umbrella charity Rape Crisis Scotland in a row over gender. Glasgow and Clyde Rape Crisis said its priority was to provide a single-sex service by an \"all-female workforce\" - and this was \"at odds\" with the charity's priorities. RCS chief executive Sandy Brindley recently apologised after another centre in Edinburgh, which was run by a trans woman, failed to provide single-sex spaces for 16 months. At the time Ms Brindley made clear that all member centres should provide single-sex spaces, but said there was no reason why transgender people could not work in rape support centres.\n\nBBC News understands the Glasgow centre made the decision in February to end its membership with Rape Crisis Scotland (RCS) - the national charity that sets service standards for member centres. The centre then held a number of meetings with RCS to discuss concerns - its view was it wanted to go beyond providing single-sex spaces and have a women-only workforce. Katie Cosgrove, co-chair of Glasgow and Clyde Rape Crisis, said the centre was not changing the way its service is run - rather that the decision was to \"publicly disassociate\" from RCS. Asked what the impact of the move would be on service users, she said she was \"not clear on what kind of impact that might be\". She said she recognised there was a need for trans women to use the service and that the centre had seen a \"small number\" of trans women - 17 in the last year. A condition of the charity's funding from the Scottish government is that services are trans-inclusive. The Glasgow centre will continue to support trans women who seek support but will not employ trans women. Ms Cosgrove said: \"We believe very strongly in the rights of women to have single-sex services within a rape crisis setting and we believe, to ensure that they are protected and that risk is minimised, that it should be an all-female workforce.\" Under updated guidance, external from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, that was published earlier this year, the definition of women only can include trans women who have a gender recognition certificate (GRC). However, it is legal to prevent trans women \u2013 including those with a GRC - from applying for a women-only role if it is a \u201cproportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\u201d. RCS said it wished the Glasgow team well. It said member centres deliver services in a variety of ways tailored to the needs of communities. A spokesperson added: \u201cAll Rape Crisis Centres must provide women-only spaces within their service but how they define this is currently for individual centres to decide. \"Rape Crisis Centres can provide single-sex spaces within Rape Crisis Scotland \u2013 and many do.\"\n\nEarlier this year a review found that Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre (ERCC) had failed to provide women-only spaces and that its CEO - a trans woman named Mridul Wadhwa - had not acted professionally or understood the limits of her authority. The report also said there was \"evidence that the actions of some ERCC staff had caused damage to some survivors\", and that concerns had been raised that some women were \"excluding themselves from approaching Rape Crisis Centres including ERCC\" because of their approach to gender identity. Ms Brindley found out ERCC was not following national standards last October and paused referrals 11 months later when the review said safeguarding was a problem. The review recommended RCS facilitate a \"shared approach\" across its centres - the charity said this work was under way.\n\nSandy Brindley is the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland - the umbrella charity which sets standards for member support centres\n\nGroups including For Women Scotland, which has campaigned against changes to transgender rights, accused the ERCC board of \"ignoring its own culpability\". The review was commissioned by RCS after an employment tribunal found in May of this year that a counsellor - Roz Adams - had been unfairly constructively dismissed. This was over her belief that people who used the service should be able to know the sex of the staff that would be dealing with their case. Ms Wadhwa was highlighted in the tribunal outcome as she appeared to believe that Ms Adams was transphobic. Ms Brindley stressed that Rape Crisis Scotland had no involvement in hiring Ms Wadhwa - who stood down from her role after the review was published. However she said there had been \"no reason\" not to agree with the appointment at the time as Ms Wadhwa had significant experience of working in the sector. The role Ms Wadhwa had is reserved for women only.\n\nMridul Wadhwa became chief executive of the Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre in 2021\n\nSince the controversy emerged, Ms Brindley has faced pressure from some groups to stand down, including from Scottish Conservative MSP Sue Webber. The BBC understands she still has the full support of the RCS board to remain in post. Ms Brindley told BBC News: \"I don\u2019t expect to be in post beyond the next 12 months but I definitely don\u2019t intend to resign just now - we've got so many important things to do.\" The chief executive previously described how the controversy had led to rape survivors who supported RCS experiencing \"horrendous\" abuse online, including being told that they \"must be lying\" about being raped. \"It is absolutely astonishing to me that this is the position we're in where rape survivors can be treated in this way in the name of women's rights supposedly,\" she said. RCS oversees 17 support centres across Scotland which offer support to men, women, transgender and non-binary people.",

We're here to win world championships - McLaren's Brown\n\nFormula 1 needs to employ stewards on a full-time basis in order to simplify the rules of the sport, says Zak Brown. The McLaren chief executive officer thinks current rules are \"overly regulated\" and \"overly complicated\". Brown has suggested paying stewards, who are currently unpaid volunteers, and giving them access to more technology in order to make the right calls on high-profile incidents. This season, McLaren's Lando Norris has been involved in back-to-back controversial track battles with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with the pair being penalised for separate incidents at the United States and Mexico City Grands Prix. \"I think we need full-time stewards,\" Brown told BBC Sport. \"I don't think the way we're set up as a sport, we are set up for success.\" Verstappen made similar comments to BBC Sport on Thursday, saying: \"Do I think consistency in the penalties could be better? Yes, for sure, but that only comes with stewards that are paid - professional stewards. \"The stewards we have right now, they are doing their very best to what they have but in a sport like this, like in other sports, when you have a paid board of stewards, it works way better.\u201d\n\nIn Austin, Norris was given a five-second penalty for going off the track and gaining an advantage trying to overtake Verstappen. The Briton refused to give the place back after Verstappen complained, highlighting he had been ahead at the apex. The stewards, however, disagreed with Norris. Many drivers made it clear they felt Verstappen\u2019s driving was not fair in Austin and told the FIA that the racing guidelines needed changing to address the type of tactics the Dutchman had employed. A week later in Mexico, the two drivers clashed again, with Verstappen being given a combined 20-second penalty for two incidents with Norris on the same lap. Norris called Verstappen's driving \"dangerous\" and flagged again that he was ahead of the three-time world champion into the corner during the first tussle. \"I think we need to take a step back and not over-regulate what happens on the track. We never used to do that in Formula 1,\" said Brown. \"I think we\u2019re racing too much to a rulebook now versus good old fashioned racing - just give the stewards a little bit more discretion. They\u2019ve raced, they know that a driver has been pushed off or not, or made a lunge, or not. And not have this black and white rulebook.\" However, Brown says he does have confidence in the governing body's president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, following the departures of senior members of FIA staff in the past year. Race director Niels Wittich, a replacement for Michael Masi in 2022, left his role with immediate effect on 12 November, with less than a month of the season remaining. Wittich was said to have \"stepped down\" but he told BBC Sport last week: \"I can confirm that I got fired and it was not my decision to leave F1.\" The German has been replaced from this weekend's Las Vegas Grand Prix by Rui Marques. \"He doesn't mess about. He makes decisions,\" Brown said of Ben Sulayem. \"I think we were surprised by that decision, more the timing of it.\" McLaren are top of the constructors' standings by 36 points with three races remaining and Brown says \"it would be unbelievable\" if the team could secure their first team title since 1998. \"It's hard to believe it was that long ago,\" he added. \"That's why we're here. We're here to win world championships.\"",

    "King Hamad received a Royal Salute from a Guard of Honour at Windsor Castle on Monday\n\nHuman rights activists have criticised an honorary knighthood given to King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, who visited the UK earlier this week. In a letter to Buckingham Palace, three Bahraini activists now living in exile called on King Charles to rescind the Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, describing the award as a \u201cbetrayal\". They cited what they called the \u201carbitrary imprisonment, brutal torture, unfair trials, and arbitrary executions of innocent individuals\". A spokesman for Bahrain's government said it \"firmly rejects these baseless claims which overlook the substantial progress the Kingdom has achieved in advancing individual rights and the rule of law\".\n\n\"We remain committed to continued reforms and welcome constructive dialogue to address any legitimate concerns fairly and transparently,\" they added. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both also expressed concern. \u201cYou have to wonder what signal this sends when the Bahraini authorities are unjustly prosecuting their critics, when human rights defenders are languishing in Bahraini jails and when the Manama authorities refuse to reinstate the citizenship of people rendered stateless on politically motivated charges,\u201d said Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of government and political relations. The award given to King Hamad as well as King Abdullah of Jordan \u2013 who are both marking silver jubilees this year \u2013 was announced on Wednesday by Buckingham Palace. It is not commenting on the criticism. Bahrain and the UK have strong diplomatic, political and military relations. On Monday, King Hamad arrived in a horse and carriage at Windsor Castle, receiving a Royal Salute from a Guard of Honour. A \u201cspectacular evening\u201d followed which ended with pipers marching around the dinner table, according to the British ambassador to Bahrain, Alastair Long, on Instagram. He said that King Charles, addressing the Bahraini monarch, had praised him for being \u201cguided by his concern and care for his people.\u201d King Hamad, a Sunni Muslim, rules a country with a Shia majority, and members of his family hold the main political and military positions. In 2011, pro-democracy protests were crushed, with the help of troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this year, hundreds of political prisoners were freed after they were granted a royal pardon to mark 25 years of King Hamad\u2019s rule. But many remain in jail, including human rights activist Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, 63, and 76-year-old opposition leader Hassan Mushaima, the fathers of two of the signatories to the letter to King Charles - Maryam Al-Khawaja and Ali Mushaima. The third signatory, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei - who is now a British citizen - said he had been beaten, tortured and jailed for calling for peaceful change. \u201cThroughout King Hamad\u2019s rule, scores of Bahrainis have been arbitrarily detained and tortured, and some have even been killed as a result of exercising their rights to assembly and free expression,\u201d Niku Jafarnia of Human Rights Watch told the BBC. \u201cThe recent pardons he\u2019s given don\u2019t make up for these abuses, and it\u2019s a disgrace that he has been granted this award while many still remain wrongfully detained,\u201d she said.",
    "Donald Trump landed his historic second United States presidency thanks to small increases in support - but lots of them, reaching across the country. Votes are still being counted, but a picture is emerging of what tipped the balance in Trump's favour. They include small but widespread gains from many sources. The map below shows in red the states where Trump won. Kamala Harris's victories are shown in blue.\n\nYou need a modern browser with javascript enabled to view the interactive content in this page.\n\nThe swing towards Trump happened across the country, as shown in the county level map below, although counting continues in many states especially in the west. Harris led by tens of thousands of votes in major cities. But Trump dominated the rural counties that lie between them. His wins may not appear to be as sizeable, but they are pervasive. And those margins add up.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden turned many of Pennsylvania's counties Democrat blue - particularly those near the eastern city of Philadelphia. In 2024, voters seem to have reversed their positions as more votes in the eastern parts of the state went to Trump. Around Georgia\u2019s major metropolis of Atlanta, votes for Harris were higher than for Biden. But almost everywhere else went further red, the colour of the Republican party, and this picture could become clearer as more votes are tallied. In Wisconsin, Trump won by less than one percentage point - about 30,000 votes at latest count.\n\nIt is difficult to identify a single group or area in the state that moved the needle towards Trump. His share of the vote increased by less than 5% in all but a handful of counties across the state, compared with 2020. If you look at the map below the change is almost imperceptible.\n\nHarris did well in the traditional Democratic urban strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison; voters came out for her in large numbers. Yet it was Trump\u2019s small but widespread gains in counties across the state that did the trick.\n\nTrump has taken Nevada, the first Republican win in the western battleground since 2004. In the vote tally so far, there has been little change among the largest groups of voters. Black voters chose Harris in similar numbers as they did Biden, while white voters maintained their support for Trump. Yet the exit poll suggested Trump saw a substantial increase in support among Hispanic and Asian voters, with Harris losing ground compared with Biden four years ago. Trump raised his share among Hispanic voters in Nevada by 13 points compared with 2020, which meant he and Harris ended up in a tie, both securing 48% of that vote.\n\nHe also enjoyed a very substantial swing among Nevada\u2019s Asian voters, from 35% in 2020 to 50% in 2024. While the Asian community accounts for just 4% of voters surveyed, we\u2019ve seen how similarly small shifts made the difference elsewhere.\n\nWhile the picture in the states that flipped will become clearer in the coming days, we can see some emerging trends on how different groups of people voted across the nation from US exit polls. These cut across demographic groups and regions. On immigration and the economy, Trump was seen as the overwhelming favourite among voters for whom either was the most important issue.\n\nFor voters who felt strongly about abortion or the state of democracy, three-quarters or more voted for Harris. This suggests a stark difference in priorities across the two groups of voters. Both campaigns emphasised these diverging issues in recent weeks, and it\u2019s clear the messaging cut through. The personalities of the candidates themselves may also have played a role in how ballots were cast. For those looking for a presidential candidate who would \u201cbring needed change\u201d to the country, a large majority voted for Trump. And two-thirds of those who most valued leadership skills did the same.\n\nA large majority of Harris voters chose her because they felt she had good judgement and \u201ccared about people like me\u201d. But the desire for change can be a powerful force when it comes to the way voters choose to cast their ballot.",
    "Between 2001 and 2006 Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 150 goals in 219 games for Manchester United\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy has left Manchester United after not being given a role in new manager Ruben Amorim's backroom staff. The 48-year-old Dutchman took over at Old Trafford on an interim basis after compatriot Erik ten Hag was sacked. Van Nistelrooy, who joined United as an assistant coach in July on a two-year deal, managed three victories and a draw in his four games during his time as caretaker boss. However, Amorim has decided against retaining the services of former Netherlands striker Van Nistelrooy, who spent five seasons at United as a player. \"Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend,\" the club said in a statement which confirmed Van Nistelrooy's exit. \"We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.\" United confirmed that fellow coaches Rene Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel have also left the club. However, former United midfielder Darren Fletcher will remain in his coaching role and continue his link between the first team and the academy. United said they will \"confirm the full men's first-team coaching composition\" under the new Portuguese boss \"in due course\".\n\nNew Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim and chief executive Omar Barrada embrace at Manchester United's training ground\n\nAmorim was appointed on a two-and-a-half-year deal earlier this month and flew into the UK from Lisbon on Monday afternoon having completing his stint as Sporting boss. He was met at United's Carrington training ground by United chief executive Omar Barrada and given a tour of the facilities. The 39-year-old has 13 days during the international break to prepare for his first match in charge of United, away against Ipswich in the Premier League on 24 November.\n\nThis is not the most surprising news but some fans will greet it with disappointment. Ruud van Nistelrooy made it clear he had a contract to remain as assistant manager until June 2026 and wanted to see it through. However, Ruben Amorim has his own long-established coaching team and there is no space in it for someone who has vast experience of Manchester United and managerial ambitions of his own. It could be argued United might have given Van Nistelrooy time to make a claim on the job himself but chief executive Omar Berrada knew who he wanted to replace Erik ten Hag so the decision was moot. However, Van Nistelrooy has impressed inside and out of the club over the last four games, so who knows what might happen in the future. Interestingly though, former United midfielder Darren Fletcher will remain in his role and continue his link between the first team and the academy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

    "Popular London nightclub Heaven has been closed on public safety grounds after a rape was reported, the Metropolitan Police said. The force successfully applied to Westminster Council to suspend the licence of the Villiers Street venue until a full hearing can take place. In an initial hearing on Friday, the council was told a woman was allegedly raped in the vicinity of the venue by a member of security staff on 1 November. The Met said a member of security staff was arrested and charged with rape, and is on remand in prison. The suspension will take effect immediately, the Met said, meaning Heaven will be closed from Friday night onwards.\n\nThe hearing was told that when the woman tried to report the attack, other staff allegedly ignored her. A council spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing a request from the Metropolitan Police, and considering evidence from both the police and the operator, the council\u2019s licensing committee has decided to suspend Heaven\u2019s licence for 28 days. \u201cWe recognise this venue\u2019s cultural significance but the committee agreed this step is necessary to prevent serious crime and protect the public. \u201cA full licensing hearing will be held in December where both the police and venue management will have the opportunity to present new evidence. \"This case is currently subject of an ongoing police investigation, and we are unable to comment further at this stage.\" Heaven posted on Instagram to say: \"We are sickened by this allegation but can't comment as it is an on going criminal investigation.

Mary \u2018Pat\u2019 Thompson was receiving personal care at Rose Lodge Nursing home in Lisburn on 18 May 2020 when she was left sitting unattended on her bed. The 89 year old suffered multiple injuries when she fell forwards onto the floor. She died days later in hospital. The care home's previous owner, Harmony CCS Limited, which is based in Belfast, was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to a single health and safety breach.\n\nIn a statement, the company said its directors wished to express their \"sincere apologies\" to Mrs Thompson's family, adding that their \"deepest sympathies\" are with the family. \"Pat was a lovely person and a much loved resident and we remain deeply sorry and saddened by the incident,\" the statement added.\n\nThe accident was investigated by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI). It found that Mrs Thompson had care plans in place which indicated she required the assistance of two carers in order to stay safe while being moved. However, the care plans provided no formal indication about the level of assistance Mrs Thompson required while she was having personal care. On the day of the fall, a junior staff member was directed by a senior staff member to provide personal care for Mrs Thompson on her own. \"As a result, Mrs. Thompson was moved by one carer and left unattended at the edge of the bed from which she fell,\" a HSENI statement said. Speaking after the court hearing, HSENI inspector Kiara Blackburn said: \u201cCare plans must identify the specific care needs of each resident and should be followed by all care staff.\"\n\nThe current owners of Rose Lodge Nursing Home, who purchased the home in 2021, after the incident took place, said in a statement that they wished \"to express their sympathy for the family\" of Mrs Thompson.",
    "England have lost three straight home matches for the first time since 2006\n\nJack van Poortvliet has been here before. Two years ago, as England's scrum-half huddled up under the posts, his face flashed up on Twickenham's big screens. New Zealand flanker Dalton Papali'i had just picked off his pass and cantered in to give New Zealand a seven-point head start. This time around it was a kick. Eben Etzebeth, looming like a skyscraper, had charged down Van Poortvliet to give South Africa a freebie try and puncture England's promising start. It will have felt like all his fault. It wasn't. England's forwards left him unprotected and vulnerable. Marcus Smith, his fly-half, had his own chance to clear and similarly found a South African torso. And, ultimately, the errors added up. For all England's unquestionable courage and energy, they have continually been undermined by mistakes this autumn. The foundations of a promising team always seem to be subsiding under their own slip-ups. They have come in all different matches, in all different guises, from all areas of the team. Against New Zealand, the crossed wires and fumbled drop-goal routine between Harry Randall and George Ford was most obvious. Against Australia, England's failure to secure a kick-off \u2013 Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii disrupting Maro Itoje \u2013 on the last play was key. But so was a botched midfield move that gave Andrew Kellaway a walk-in. Against South Africa, Ben Earl missed a vital tackle on Damian de Allende, before England's faint hopes of crowbarring their way to a comeback were dashed by Luke Cowan-Dickie's twitchy line-out throw and Itoje picking, not going and being caught at the back of a promising breakdown. Those are individual moments, perhaps the most glaring ones. But you could pick plenty more. After three straight home defeats for the first time since 2006, the spotlight certainly shouldn't shine on Van Poortvliet alone. It must also extend to the sidelines to take in selections and systems.\n\nVan Poortvliet's inclusion was the latest scrum-half shuffle in the absence of the injured Alex Mitchell. Ben Spencer went from first choice to third string in the space of a week. Randall, who started the majority of England's games in the 2022 Six Nations, does not seem trusted to do so now. Stepping back in to start against the world champions, after more than a year out of the Test rugby, was therefore the stretch asked of Van Poortvliet. The midfield combination of Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade \u2013 which seemed one of the most settled parts of England's side before the autumn \u2013 hasn't mustered much punch over the last three games. Tactically, England were set up to exploit their height advantage on the wing. On the turf, it never worked out that way. Instead the scorching pace and side-stepping brilliance of Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse was decisive. More generally, England came up short in the final quarter once more. Playing against 14 for half of it, they failed to score a single point. Across 2024, they have conceded 30 more points than they have scored after the hour mark. Whether it is fitness, lack of tactical finesse or a shortage of bench strength, the fade is real. In attack, Plan A was to lean heavily and hopefully on Marcus Smith to produce a moment of magic. It doesn't seem to progress much further through the alphabet.\n\nMarcus Smith carried 12 times from fly-half, with only number eight Ben Earl doing so more for England against South Africa\n\nAnd in defence, they have conceded an average of 32 points a game so far this autumn, letting in 12 tries in three matches. When it comes to sorting these problems little is made easier by an environment that chews through coaches at an alarming rate. England needed to be spotless to make up a chasm in class and form on South Africa. In Paris, in last year's Rugby World Cup semi-final, they very nearly were. On Saturday though, the blemishes were obvious and plentiful - and this autumn they seem to be setting in, rather than shifting. A bad day in the office seems to have become the standard. Against a ragged Japan, even an error-strewn England should be good enough. They saw off the Brave Blossoms by 35 points in the summer. Whatever mind games and inside information Eddie Jones has is unlikely to stop a repeat defeat for Japan. One win would be scant return from an autumn that promised more however. And all the time, the Six Nations, renewed rivalries with the northern hemisphere's best and fears England are just not as good as we thought, lurk like Etzebeth around a breakdown.",
    "Workers at Meta have reportedly been sacked for abusing the tech firm's meal voucher system, such as using it to buy toothpaste and washing powder. Other breaches of the policy included sharing the vouchers with others or going over budget, according to people who said they work at Meta. There are differing accounts over how much warning, if any, the owner of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp gave the workers before firing them. Separately, the company has reportedly cut jobs across the business. Meta has been contacted for comment.\n\nMeta staff are given $25 (\u00a319) for lunch, $20 for breakfast, and $25 for dinner in vouchers which are meant to be used for ordering food from Grubhub, the US name for takeaway website Just Eat. Posts on anonymous work social message board Blind appear to confirm elements of the story, originally reported by the Financial Times. One user wrote that more than 30 people were fired last week because they used the credits for \"non-food items, shared credits with people, or went above budget\". Examples of the non-food items bought included toothpaste, toothbrushes and wine glasses. \"They were given a warning to stop which most of them did, but were still fired three months later even after stopping,\" the user said. Some repeated the claim the staff were warned, though other users wrote that there were no warnings. Separately, the company has also reportedly made job cuts at WhatsApp, Instagram and Reality Labs, its virtual reality business responsible for the Oculus headset. These cuts are not related to the issues surrounding the voucher system. Jane Manchun Wong, a former security engineer at Meta, said on Wednesday that she had lost her job as part of these wider layoffs. \"I\u2019m still trying to process this but I\u2019m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ms Wong was hired just over a year ago as a software engineer after making 2022's Forbes 30 under 30 list. The layoffs were first reported by Verge, with a spokesperson telling the tech publication: \"A few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\"",

Southampton 'are one of the best in the Premier League' - Pep Guardiola\n\nSouthampton were beaten at Manchester City, as most people expected. They are bottom of the Premier League, with a single point from their first nine games of the season. Manager Russell Martin is under pressure, despite guiding Saints back to the top flight only five months ago. Speaking to the media after Saturday's 1-0 result, both managers heaped praise on the beaten team. It was not so much that they were unlucky to lose. If Erling Haaland had a better day, he would have scored more than just the fifth-minute match-winner. Manchester City beat Southampton in an open game - not just because they found a way through a blanket defence. Towards the end of the first half, the visitors had the majority of possession. It was down to 42.3% by the end. As a guide, City\u2019s previous two opponents, Sparta Prague and Wolves, have had 20.1% and 22.4% respectively. If Southampton are to go down, or Martin is to lose his job, it will be by committing to a gameplan he believes in. \"I took the job [at MK Dons] nearly five years ago, with the club in the League One relegation zone and the chairman saying he didn't care if they got relegated if he could see something he believed in and could be proud of,\" said Martin. \"There have been some moments of real difficulty at MK and Swansea and here, where you get questioned and have to make a big decision. \"But if I end up losing my job at some point, which is inevitable, at least I can say I have stuck to what I want to be, as a person first, then a leader and then as a manager. \"To get to the Premier League and then change would be illogical. I cannot stand on the sidelines watching something I don't feel connected with or love. I don't see the point in that.\" That requires Southampton's players to have courage to take the ball in tight areas, carry on passing when the pressure is at its greatest and not allow poor results or adversity to change that mindset.\n\nSouthampton manager Russell Martin was praised by counterpart Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's 1-0 win at Etihad Stadium\n\nThe circumstances are significantly different - given the size of the club he was going into, and the knowledge he could call on generational talents in Xavi and Andres Iniesta, and the man he regards as the greatest ever in Lionel Messi - but Pep Guardiola needed to do something similar when he was given the Barcelona job, aged 37 - a year younger than Martin is now. Now revered as one of the greatest managers in history, Guardiola appreciates what Martin is doing and even feels there are aspects of Southampton's play he can learn from. \"We were not sloppy, we were not flat, but we struggled to regain the ball because they are really good,\" said the City boss. \"I'm a spectator. I prefer the players to get the ball to feet, not the teeth. \"When I see the opponent do the things I like to do with my team and they do it really well, I make a compliment. \"I'm sure I will learn, there were some movements, the reasons why they do things, the movements they make to link to the striker. It's not easy.\u201d He added on Sky Sports: \"It's a good game to learn as a manager. I am going to learn a lot with Russell because they did really well.\" Guardiola did not just praise Martin to the media, he also spoke to the Saints boss straight after the final whistle - and Martin revealed City and England playmaker Phil Foden had also done so. \"They felt we were really brave with the ball and did stuff not many teams do,\" said Martin. \"It is not easy to play that way but he probably understands it more than anyone. \"I have seen so many teams promoted and get nowhere. If we lose I can accept it when the lads show a level of courage like they did today. If they do that here they can do it anywhere. \"I will live and die by the sword for what I believe in. If we keep playing like we did today we will have some fun and be all right.\" Fun might be an extreme way of describing Southampton's current predicament. Pressure can scramble the mind and - after throwing away a victory against Ipswich in injury time and losing a two-goal lead in the final half-hour against Leicester - the forthcoming games against Everton and Wolves look huge for Martin and his side's survival hopes. If the former Scotland international can really have fun in games like that, he deserves all the success that comes his way.",
    "Fly-halves Marcus (left) and Fin (right) Smith are among 17 England players to receive new deals with the Rugby Football Union\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick has named a group of 17 players that will receive English rugby\u2019s first Enhanced Elite Player Squad contracts. Fly-halves George Ford, Marcus Smith and Fin Smith have been given one of the deals but there are no tighthead props in the group. Bath\u2019s Sam Underhill is a surprise omission having started all of England\u2019s eight Test matches in 2024. The contracts - the first of their kind - allow Borthwick to have the final say on all sports science and medical matters in relation to the players, handing the England boss unprecedented influence compared to his predecessors. \"I am confident that these contracts, and our strong relationship with the Premiership clubs, will play a significant role in England Rugby\u2019s continued development,\" he said. Northampton\u2019s Alex Mitchell is the only scrum-half in the 17, with Ellis Genge the only loosehead prop, while Sale flanker Tom Curry has been handed an Enhanced Contract despite his long injury lay-off. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has capped off a breakthrough year by being included in the group, while Henry Slade has also been given a contract despite not making the 2023 Rugby World Cup squad. Flanker Chandler Cunningham-South started England\u2019s three Test matches on their summer tour, but has been left out of the 17.\n\nAside from Genge and Curry, the other forwards to receive a contract are Ollie Chessum, Theo Dan, Ben Earl, Jamie George, Maro Itoje and George Martin, while Tommy Freeman, George Furbank and Ollie Lawrence are the remaining backs. \"One of the aims of the new Men\u2019s Professional Game Partnership is to create world-leading English teams,\" added Rugby Football Union director of performance rugby Conor O\u2019Shea. \"We believe this new collaborative approach between club, country and the players can bring greater stability to English rugby, as well as supporting the growth and performance of the England men\u2019s team.\" A new player-led organisation called Team England Rugby negotiated the deal with the Rugby Football Union after the players broke away from their long-running arrangement with the Rugby Players Association earlier this year. The 17 players will now receive a salary from the RFU, of around \u00a3160,000 per year, rather than match fees of approximately \u00a323,000 per game.",
    "Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of sexually assaulting teenager in new lawsuits\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing new allegations of rape, sexual abuse and sexual assault after a series of fresh lawsuits were filed on Monday. At least six lawsuits were filed in New York federal court by two women and four men. They include allegations that span from 1995 to 2021. The unnamed accusers allege some of the assaults happened at Mr Combs' parties, which were attended by major celebrities and music artists. Lawyers for Mr Combs denied the allegations, saying in a statement to the BBC that he \"has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman\".\n\nOne of the accusers said he was 16 when he attended one of the parties in the Hamptons in 1998. In the lawsuit, he describes being thrilled to get an invitation to Mr Combs' party, which became a premier A-list annual event for celebrities. The accuser said he saw countless celebrities and music artists as he walked around, and ran into Mr Combs while he was on the way to the bathroom. He said he started talking to Mr Combs about breaking into the music industry when they went to somewhere more private. The accuser alleges that during their conversation, Mr Combs abruptly ordered him to undress. The lawsuit includes a photo of the pair together at the party with the teen's face blurred out. According to the lawsuit, Mr Combs said it was \u201ca rite of passage\u201d and \u201cthe route to becoming a star\". The rapper told the teen he could make anyone a star and the teen had the right \"look\", the lawsuit states.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Comb's parties were an annual tradition that attracted celebrities from Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber to Mariah Carey and the Kardashians\n\nAnother lawsuit filed on Monday includes allegations by a woman who claims Mr Combs raped her in a hotel room in 2004 when she was a 19-year-old college student. According to the lawsuit, she met the music mogul at a photoshoot, where he then invited her and a friend to attend a private party at his hotel. Once they arrived, the lawsuit alleges that Mr Combs \"fondled, molested, and ultimately raped her\u201d despite her repeatedly asking him to stop. Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing the accusers, said he is representing more than 100 people who plan to sue the rapper on allegations of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Mr Buzbee said that some of the alleged victims include children. He said the lawsuits are being brought under the Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act, which allows victims to file older claims. \"We will let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves, and will work to see that justice is done,\" Mr Buzbee said in a statement after filing the lawsuits Monday. \"We expect to be filing many more cases over the next several weeks naming Mr Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.\" The lawsuits are the latest of more than a dozen that have been filed against Mr Combs recently, accusing the music mogul of assaults, rape and sexual extortion. He has denied all civil and criminal claims against him. Mr Combs is facing federal criminal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. A judge last week tentatively scheduled his trial to begin on 5 May 2025. Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since his 16 September arrest. His lawyers have argued for his release until the trial, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. A New York federal judge denied their request for bail, arguing that Mr Combs was a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
    "North Korea says it will cut off all roads to the South\n\nRoads and railways leading from North Korea to the South are rarely used\n\nNorth Korea will sever road and railway access to South Korea from Wednesday in a bid to \u201ccompletely separate\u201d the two countries. Its military said the North would \u201cpermanently shut off and block the southern border\u201d and fortify areas on its side. The Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) described the move as \u201ca self-defensive measure for inhibiting war\u201d, claiming it was in response to war exercises in South Korea and the frequent presence of American nuclear assets in the region. It marks an escalation of hostility at a time when tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years.\n\n\u201cThe acute military situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula requires the armed forces of the DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] to take a more resolute and stronger measure in order to more creditably defend the national security,\u201d the KPA said in a report published by state media outlet KCNA. The declaration is a largely symbolic step by Pyongyang. Roads and railways leading from North Korea to the South are rarely used, and have been incrementally dismantled by North Korean authorities over the past year. It also comes amid a broader push by Pyongyang to change how it relates to the South, and follows a string of inflammatory incidents that have worsened relations between the two countries. Those incidents have ranged from missile tests to hundreds of trash balloons being sent over North Korea\u2019s southern border. Notably, North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un announced at the start of 2024 that he was no longer striving towards reunification with the South, raising concerns that war could resume in the Korean peninsula. \u201cI think it is necessary to revise some contents of the Constitution of the DPRK,\u201d Kim said at a meeting of North Korea\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Assembly (SPA) in January. \u201cIn my view, it is necessary to delete such expressions in the constitution as \u2018northern half\u2019 and \u2018independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity',\u201d he added, suggesting that the constitution should be revised \u201cat the next session\u201d. That next session was held this week, and concluded on Tuesday. Yet while many onlookers had expected Pyongyang to ratify Kim\u2019s earlier comments and make constitutional amendments to unification and border policies, no such changes were publicised. One analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification think tank suggested that Pyongyang could be waiting for the outcome of the US election before making any concrete decisions. Officials could \"consider adjusting the extent of constitutional revisions to align with the direction of the new (US) administration\", Hong Min told news agency AFP. It is unclear whether North Korea\u2019s decision to cut off all roads and railways linking it to the South was a result of discussions during the SPA session.",

    "Norris says he's 'not quite at Verstappen's level'\n\nLando Norris is 57 points behind leader Max Verstappen in the drivers' championship\n\nLando Norris says he is \"not quite at the level\" of title rival Max Verstappen when it comes to race-craft. The Briton was controversially penalised at Sunday's United States Grand Prix, demoting him from third to fourth behind Verstappen, for overtaking off track. Norris said: \"Max is the best in the world in this style of defence and attacking. So I have to be at his level and at the moment I am not quite at the level I need to be at. \"It's a shame to say, but it's probably the truth. At the same time, it's a chance for me to learn and progress.\" However, Norris said he did not believe he deserved the penalty and Verstappen's driving in the incident was \"not how racing should be\". McLaren have submitted a request for a right of review into Norris' penalty, with a hearing to take place in Mexico on Friday. They will need to demonstrate there is a \"significant and relevant new element\" for it to progress. Norris was among a number of drivers who questioned Verstappen's approach to the corner, essentially saying it complied with the rules, but was not fair racing. But in response, Verstappen said: \"It's how the rules are written. I don't make the rules. I just follow the rules as much as I can. I just implement the rules and play with them.\" Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton added: \"You shouldn't be able to come off the brakes and run more speed in and go off the track and still hold your place.\" The Mercedes driver felt a change had been needed for some time, and pointed out Verstappen had used the same tactic in their 2021 title fight. Hamilton's team-mate George Russell said he would ask the FIA whether, following a review, they believed Verstappen should have been penalised for his manoeuvre. \"In my view, he should have been penalised, therefore there isn't really a loophole,\" added the Briton. \"If they say he shouldn't have been, then he is exploiting a loophole. \"But he is in a title battle with Lando the same way as he was with Lewis and I don't think he would have done the same manoeuvre if it was any other driver, same as in Brazil 2021. It was a bit do or die, and he is happy to drive in that manner against his title rival, which I totally understand.\" Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, who won the race in Austin, said Verstappen's defence of his position from Norris was \"a bit too extreme\". Leclerc added the Dutchman \"has always been on the limit of the regulations and sometimes it goes over a little, but that's what makes those fights exciting\". Many drivers want to talk to governing body, the FIA, at this weekend's Mexico City Grand Prix about F1's rules on racing. Verstappen used these to his advantage in Austin in a move at Turn 12 in which Norris was trying to overtake him around the outside. The rules say if the driver on the inside has his front axle ahead of the car outside him at the apex of the corner, he does not need to give his rival any room on the exit. But a number of drivers feel Verstappen is exploiting that rule by braking so late that he complies with the regulation, but then goes off the track himself. Another rule says drivers are not allowed to force a rival off the track, but this was not applied in this case. Several drivers feel defending in that way makes it almost impossible to overtake Verstappen.\n\nNorris, who is 57 points behind the three-time world champion with five races to go and 146 available, said: \"The fact of getting off the brakes just to be ahead at apex, no matter how wide you run on the exit, is incorrect and I don't believe that's how racing should be. \"So I think there are some tweaks [that need making]. But Max races hard, I expect that. I just don't think I was in the wrong last weekend. I don't believe either of us were necessarily in the wrong. \"It's not that I believe he should have got a penalty and I shouldn't. I don't believe either of us should have got a penalty. \"The stewards have a tough job because every race is different. You have to understand the driver's mindset. He has nothing to lose, I have a lot to lose. So he can afford to take bigger risks than I can and that's just the unfortunate position I'm in at the moment.\" Asked whether the rules give too much incentive to brake late and have the front axle ahead of a rival's when defending a corner on the inside in the way Verstappen did, Leclerc added: \"It's a very complex subject. I don't have the right answer here. Common sense has to be applied in certain situations. \"When a driver does that multiple times in the same way\u2026we have to still create overtaking opportunities. What I have seen in Austin was maybe a bit too extreme.\" Williams driver Alex Albon felt there needed to be an addition to that specific rule that covers the scenario when both drivers go off track, as happened between Verstappen and Norris. \"It's tricky because he's still in control but he's still off the circuit,\" he said. \"So there probably needs to be some kind of sentence around, 'if you then end up going off the track yourself, there should be some kind of fall back or give back position'.\"",
    "Former Australia coach Darren Lehmann says Joe Root needs to score a century down under to be considered an \"all-time great\" alongside fellow batters Virat Kohli of India, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealander Kane Williamson.\n\nRoot has scored 35 Test centuries - the most for an England batter - but is yet to reach the milestone in an away Ashes series.\n\nHe has played 27 innings in Australia, averaging 35.68 and with a highest score of 89.\n\nLehmann was speaking after Australia were thrashed by 295 runs in the opening Test against India, with Kohli scoring his 30th Test ton overall and seventh in Australia.\n\n\"Nope, he is a rung below for that reason,\" said Lehmann on ABC Sport, when asked if Root was in the same category.\n\n\"They\u2019ve made runs all over the world in difficult conditions against different oppositions, and that's the only thing stopping Joe Root.

    "Emergency services were called to the care home in the early hours of Wednesday\n\nA woman has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the deaths of three people at a care home. Dorset Police said earlier the deaths at the Gainsborough Care Home in Swanage, were being treated as \"unexplained\" but potential carbon monoxide poisoning was the \"primary line of inquiry\". Emergency services were called to Gainsborough Care Home in Ulwell Road in Swanage, Dorset, at 05:20 BST. Seven people were taken to hospital and residents were evacuated from the building to a nearby church hall.\n\nPolice said a 60-year-old local woman had been detained on Wednesday evening. Det Ch Insp Neil Third said: \u201cAs part of our investigation, we have made one arrest to enable us to establish whether there have been actions or omissions which are grossly negligent and gather as much information as we can about what has happened. \"It is important to note that the arrest process also provides certain legal protection to individuals and I would ask for the media and public to avoid speculating any further now that legal proceedings are active.\" The force said earlier that the families of those who died have been informed and the coroner has been notified.\n\nEmergency services remained at the scene throughout the day as the investigation into the cause of the deaths continued\n\nAbout 40 residents from the home, run by Agincare, were seen being transferred, some in wheelchairs, to All Saints Church a short distance away. Dorset Council said it was working with the home and other agencies to support the residents of the care home. \"Many of the residents are vulnerable people with significant care needs, and so we are working with them to understand how to meet their needs in the short term and identify their next steps,\" it said on Wednesday. In an earlier statement, Agincare said it has allocated \"extra staffing resources\" to provide support after an incident at the site, and that residents moved to a village hall and church are \"safe and well\". They said: \"We appreciate that this is a stressful and worrying time for those involved, and have allocated extra staffing resources to provide support locally. We are contacting and updating residents' families. \"We will continue to work with the lead local authority services to return residents into their home at the earliest opportunity, and will provide further updates in due course.\"\n\nSouth West Ambulance NHS Trust said a hazardous area response team environment crew was sent to the scene along with 10 double-crewed ambulances. Fire crews from across Dorset were also deployed. They were assisted by a crew from Winchester in Hampshire. Gas distribution company SGN said it was called to Gainsborough Care Home earlier on Wednesday. It said engineers were sent to complete safety checks in the building. \"Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by this tragic incident,\" a statement said.\n\nDo you have a story BBC Dorset should cover?",
    "Behind the scenes of Heartstopper series three\n\nKit Connor and Joe Locke, who play Nick and Charlie, say their friendship means they support each other during difficult days of filming.\n\nOn a freezing cold November day in 2023, we\u2019re driving up to a school on the outskirts of London. It appears disused and unremarkable - but then a sign reading \u2018Truham High\u2019 gives the game away. This abandoned-looking building is actually the set of Netflix sensation Heartstopper, and on the day we visit, shooting for series three is well under way. The new episodes will be released on 3 October. Inside, the hustle and bustle you might expect in a school corridor has been replaced with the organised chaos of a film set. The plain school interior is covered with colourful murals painted in the style of Alice Oseman's graphic novels, which inspired the show. In the first two series it\u2019s been a safe space for Joe Locke\u2019s character, Charlie, to go to when he\u2019s having a hard time. During our visit he\u2019s joined by Kit Connor, who plays Nick - and the conversation they\u2019re filming looks difficult. They\u2019re sitting in a corner and speaking in hushed tones.\n\nHeartstopper is known for its colourful scenery, like Mr Ajayai's classroom, but the walls and corridors are painted over in between seasons so that other TV productions can use them\n\nWhile the producers are tight-lipped about the detail of what they\u2019re shooting, they do tell us \u201cit\u2019s quite an intense scene\u201d. They\u2019re protective over how many people are in the room with the actors during more emotional scenes. Dozens of silent crew members are crammed into a room next door, watching intently on monitors while the actors do several takes. The third series of the show deals with more serious topics than the first two; Charlie\u2019s eating disorder will be a key storyline, and some characters will be having sex for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said the show grows up with the characters, which is definitely the case this year,\" Locke says, speaking to us in a quick break before his next scene. \"The show deals with some more heavy topics like mental health, and growing up, so there\u2019s a lot of \u2018teenageness\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A major storyline for series three will focus on Charlie, played by Joe Locke, as he struggles with an eating disorder\n\nThe show has been praised for showcasing \u201cqueer joy\u201d - shining a light on the positive elements of growing up as part of the LGBTQ+ community - but Locke says it feels important to make sure it is still realistic. \u201cIt\u2019s all about authenticity, and trying to make your portrayal of a topic that is quite intense and quite close to people\u2019s hearts as true as possible,\u201d he says. Connor and Locke joked it was hard getting used to kissing your friend on camera, and with the actors all being so close, they admit some of the more passionate scenes can feel strange to film. Connor tells us: \u201cWhen you\u2019re shooting for seven-and-a-half hours as we did [for] a slightly steamier scene, it\u2019s like, what is my job?\u201d\n\nDuring our visit it\u2019s clear the cast members\u2019 chemistry goes beyond their time on-screen. Throughout our interviews they have in-jokes and gently make fun of each other, which Connor says helps with the more difficult days on set. \u201cAfter filming we all just sort of pile into someone\u2019s flat and spend time together, we have a great way of doing it where we don\u2019t talk about work or anything like that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all just go home, make dinner and criticise each other's cooking skills. \u201c[Joe Locke] actually cooked a good chilli this time\u2026 last time it was a very, very bad chilli. This time Will, who plays Tao, had seconds\u2026 but he will eat anything.\u201d\n\nKit Connor and Joe Locke, who play boyfriends Nick and Charlie, say it's hard getting used to kissing your friend on camera\n\nWhile the friendships might be real, some of the most iconic locations in the show are actually flat-packed and assembled inside the school, as and when required. During our visit, Nick\u2019s bedroom is assembled in what would have been the school\u2019s sports hall. There are no lights as no scenes are planned here today, so we explore using our phone torches instead. Even in the semi-darkness, the attention to detail is clear. From books about bisexuality, to Polaroid pictures of Nick and Charlie together, they\u2019ve gone to painstaking lengths to make the bedroom a true reflection of the character's journey throughout the series. \u201cThe fans really notice everything, and have theories about even the tiniest of details\u2026 you should see some of the TikToks they make,\u201d a member of the crew tells us.\n\nIt might not look like it from the outside, but this wooden box is actually Nick's bedroom in the show. Each set is built as and when needed in the school's sports hall\n\nJust down the corridor from Nick\u2019s flat-pack bedroom is the costume department, where designer Adam Dee says he likes giving mega-fans things to spot. \u201cIf they\u2019ve got a scene with an open wardrobe, [we\u2019ll] sneak in some iconic pieces from previous series so the audience can spot them,\" he says. \u201cWith Elle, she has a sewing station in her room, so we managed to add in some bits and pieces to her wardrobe that are made from two other items we\u2019ve sewed together, or vintage scarves we\u2019ve turned into tops.\u201d Heartstopper was somewhat of a surprise hit for Netflix, and series one launched with very little promotion. It became one of the top 10 most-watched English-language series within two days of its release and received an almost-unheard-of 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes - something many critics have put down to the diverse on-screen representation. Season three involves some of the show\u2019s older characters turning 16 and starting to have sex.\n\nSeason three will show the developing relationship between Elle and Tao (Yasmin Finney and William Gao)\n\nYasmin Finney\u2019s character, Elle, who is transgender, will be shown starting a sexual relationship with her on-screen boyfriend Tao (William Gao). The sex lives of transgender characters are often left out of TV storylines.

    "Students at Coleg y Cymoedd in Nantgarw say cuts to free bus travel will make college \"unaffordable\" in the future\n\nWelsh councils are facing \"unsustainable\" budget pressures over the next few years according to the body which represents them. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said funding shortfalls could \"significantly impact\" councils\u2019 ability to deliver essential services. The BBC has identified a budget shortfall of at least \u00a3540m across Wales by 2026-27. The Welsh government said it meets local authorities \"regularly\" to discuss the \"very real challenges they face\" ahead of its draft budget in December.\n\nRhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil councils are planning to withdraw funding for some school transport, and Caerphilly council is currently consulting on proposals to do so., external From September 2026 Merthyr will no longer fund over-16s to travel to college outside of the council area, apart from those attending Welsh medium or faith schools. The changes in RCT will be introduced from September 2025, and students who study at college Coleg y Cymoedd\u2019s campus in Nantgarw said the change will have a big impact on future students\u2019 ability to attend the college. Seventeen-year-old Cavan Griffin, who lives in Rhydyfelin, said the local school sixth form has recently closed, meaning that young people wanting to do A-levels have to travel. \"I\u2019m working a job\" he said, \"but I couldn\u2019t keep up every day paying for a bus back and forth to college.\"\n\nHis classmate Abi Meredith agreed: \"If you\u2019re going to make people within that radius pay, they\u2019re not going to come to college.\" Fellow A-level student Alfie Warner already walks because he lives within two miles (3.2km) of the Nantgarw campus and it takes him about half an hour each way. He said it\u2019s a challenge in the winter, adding: \"It limits you sometimes for after school clubs because you just want to get home.\" Coleg y Cymoedd\u2019s principal, Jonathan Morgan said around a thousand students could be affected by the proposed changes in the three councils' policies. He said 42% of learners at the college come from families where the household income is below \u00a323,000 a year. \"To push further costs onto those families by making them self-fund transport is for me a step too far,\" said Mr Morgan.\n\nRCT council said its school transport policy remained more generous than many other Welsh councils, but it \"had to make difficult decisions to ensure that services continue to be delivered in a financially sustainable way\". Caerphilly council said its \"transport budget is under significant financial pressure\" and it would \"fully consider the views of the community\" before agreeing any changes in future. Merthyr Tydfil council said the changes had been approved after \"significant discussion\" as part of \"the efficiency savings needed with the authority\".\n\nSimon Knoyle says Neath Port Talbot council is trying to prioritise vulnerable residents\n\nThere are some services which local authorities are legally bound to provide, like education and social services care for children and older people. But as budget pressures have grown, many have cut back on other services which they do not have a legal duty to give. Neath Port Talbot council has a predicted deficit of nearly \u00a3160 per person by 2026-27, and the cabinet member for finance, Simon Knoyle, warned the next few years look \"bleak\". He said: \"The last two years have already seen us take almost \u00a345m out of the base budget through efficiency measures and cuts.\" But Mr Knoyle said the council was trying to prioritise vulnerable residents.\n\nAllison Southall's team help Neath Port Talbot residents claim an additional \u00a310.5m in benefits last year\n\nIt recently expanded its welfare rights team which helps people to claim benefits they\u2019re entitled to. Allison Southall manages the team, which is part funded by the Welsh government, and said she helped 3,400 people claim an extra \u00a310.5m last year. \"Any reduction in funding would have a huge impact on the service we\u2019re able to provide, bearing in mind we\u2019ve got a current case load of about 750 people,\" she said. With the UK government Budget due at the end of October and the Welsh government draft budget following in December, the WLGA is calling on both governments \"to step up and provide the investment we need to keep these essential services running\".\n\nThe Welsh government said it recognised \"the very real challenges local authorities are facing\". \"We meet regularly with local authorities to discuss these against the backdrop of the current financial climate, as we prepare our own draft budget,\" a spokesperson said. The UK government said that funding councils in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh government, and it is \"committed to working with them to achieve the best possible funding for local councils in Wales\".",
    "Why did Hamilton struggle when Russell was competitive?\n\nMax Verstappen climbed up from 17th to claim a stunning victory at a heavily rain-affected Sao Paulo Grand Prix, as he took what seems to be a decisive grip on the drivers' championship. Alpine duo Esteban Ocon and Pierre Galsy joined him on the podium, while it was a difficult race for Verstappen's title rival Lando Norris, who could only finish sixth. BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Sao Paulo.\n\nRain is the great equaliser of talent and cars; just how great among history is Max Verstappen in the rain? That was imperious, another class. \u2013 Nick Any ranking of great wet-weather wins is inevitably subjective, but there are a handful held up as the very best, and it really does feel as if Verstappen in Sao Paulo on Sunday should be added to the list. The candidates are well known to Formula 1 aficionados:\n\u2022 None Jim Clark winning by almost five minutes, and lapping all but second-placed Jack Brabham, at Spa in Belgium in 1963\n\u2022 None Jackie Stewart winning by four minutes in fog and rain at the Nurburgring in 1968\n\u2022 None Ayrton Senna\u2019s stunning win at the 1993 European Grand Prix at Donington Park, lapping all but second-placed Damon Hill after doing five pit stops in the changeable conditions, and that brilliant first lap, in which he passed four cars to take the lead\n\u2022 None Michael Schumacher in a league of his own in Spain in 1996\n\u2022 None Lewis Hamilton winning by more than a minute at Silverstone in 2008 You can add a few more, too, including Jenson Button's dramatic last-to-first win in Canada in 2011, and Gilles Villeneuve's annihilation of the field at Watkins Glen in 1979, for example. All these races share characteristics - challenging conditions, often awful visibility, one driver apparently on a separate level from the rest of the field. Those all apply to Verstappen in Brazil on Sunday. His first lap was stunning - rising from 17th on the grid (although 15th car, as a result of Alex Albon and Lance Stroll not starting) to 11th. Then he was up to sixth by lap 11. OK, Verstappen did not scythe through the group involving Yuki Tsunoda\u2019s RB, Esteban Ocon\u2019s Alpine and Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc as quickly as he might have been expected to do. Yes, the win turned on a gamble on a red flag, which took George Russell and Lando Norris out of the picture - much to the annoyance of Russell, who disagreed with Mercedes\u2019 decision to pit him for fresh tyres under the virtual safety car. And in clear air, Verstappen did not have the huge advantage that Schumacher and Hamilton showed in Barcelona and Silverstone, where both were as much as five seconds a lap faster than anyone else. But his overtaking moves were clean and clinical, and the one to take the lead from Esteban Ocon\u2019s Alpine was a beauty - sending it on the brakes from at least two car lengths back. Once into the lead, Verstappen was a lot faster than anyone else. It was different class. And his win had something none of these other classics had - winning from so far back. That in itself is worthy of particular note. So, yes, there are plenty of reasons to rank it right up there with the very best, and the same goes for Verstappen himself. It\u2019s far from the first time he has excelled in the wet - he always has. Think of his brilliant comeback to third in Brazil in 2016, for example.\n\u2022 None Which was the greatest F1 wet-weather drive?\n\nMax Verstappen's drive in the wet was superb, but Lewis Hamilton is renowned for his wet driving. Why was he not competitive when George Russell was? \u2013 Howard Hamilton had a very difficult weekend in Brazil, and it follows closely on from another equally difficult one in Austin two weeks before. Any driver, no matter how great, needs to feel confidence in their car to perform at their best, and the Mercedes is simply not giving Hamilton the messages he needs. In Brazil, he could not build any confidence in the rear of the car. This is what he said after the race on Sunday: \"The race was crap but the driving Senna\u2019s car (a demo run in the 1990 McLaren-Honda MP4-6) was the best thing ever. I\u2019m still happy and grateful I had that experience here in Interlagos. \"An amazing reception from the fans. They turned up at 3am, I think, this morning. Let\u2019s not talk about the car because the car is no good. \"It\u2019s devastating to have these bad races in the second half of the season, but we are trying coming into the weekends, and it\u2019s definitely not acceptable and not good enough. \"We and I have to take accountability. I am doing my best with what I\u2019ve got. The car has been the worst this weekend. We will have to find out what it is. One of the cars is working a lot better, so there is obviously potential there.\" How will he get through the remaining three races, he was asked? \"Put my focus on to something else,\" he replied. \"I don\u2019t care if I finish ahead or behind George. I just want to keep the car out of the wall and try to score points for the team. Give me a car that doesn\u2019t bounce off the track and hopefully we can get a better result.\" He added that the end of the season \"can\u2019t come soon enough\". There seem to be a combination of issues here. In general, Hamilton has been struggling to get the best out of the ground-effect cars in qualifying since the current rules were introduced in 2022. This is because the cars don\u2019t respond to being hustled aggressively, something a number of drivers have mentioned. It remains an open question, though, as to why Hamilton - previously known for his adaptability - has not been able to adapt to the driving style required. And why he is sometimes struggling compared with Russell. Brazil was an exception, but generally his race performances have been as strong as ever. He has taken two wins this year, and until Sunday was ahead of Russell in the championship, despite being well down on his team-mate in qualifying, both in their head-to-head and in average pace. Clearly, something is not working between Hamilton and this Mercedes car, especially over one lap.\n\nDriving Ayrton Senna's 1990 McLaren-Honda was the highlight of Lewis Hamilton's weekend in Interlagos\n\nShould there be a change to the rules allowing tyres changes in red-flag conditions to remove the free pit stop advantage? \u2013 Nicola This topic comes up from time to time in circumstances such as those in Brazil on Sunday. This rule quirk potentially decided the race, and certainly disadvantaged Lando Norris and George Russell to the benefit of Max Verstappen and the Alpine drivers, who eventually finished on the podium. The other race that always springs to mind is Monaco in 2011, when the final stages were building into a gripping climax between Sebastian Vettel\u2019s Red Bull, Fernando Alonso\u2019s Ferrari and Jenson Button\u2019s McLaren. Vettel was on tyres that may or may not have made it to the end of the race - Alonso\u2019s considerably fresher, and Button\u2019s fresher still. Could Vettel hold them off? The question became redundant when there was a multi-car crash at the Swimming Pool and the race was red-flagged. Another example is Pierre Gasly\u2019s win for Alpha Tauri at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, when a pit stop just before a red flag led to the Frenchman being promoted to third, behind Lewis Hamilton, who had a penalty, and Lance Stroll, who still needed to stop. And that became a win. After that Monaco race, I remember asking the late FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting why that rule was in place. He agreed it wasn\u2019t very fair and should be looked at. But nothing happened when he was alive, and it still hasn\u2019t since he died on the eve of the 2019 season. It does seem anomalous, and it can be argued it is unfair. It can also be argued that in circumstances such as Brazil on Sunday it leads to teams and drivers taking unnecessary risks. Red Bull and Alpine decided to leave Verstappen, Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly out on worn intermediate tyres exactly because they expected there to be a big crash and a red flag - and George Russell wanted to do the same. This is despite Verstappen admitting it was \u201csketchy\u201d and Russell saying the conditions were \u201cundriveable\u201d. On the other side, it can be argued that the rules are what they are, and it adds the potential for upsets, and extra interest. Lando Norris said: \"It\u2019s a silly rule that no one agrees with but you will always agree when it benefits you. Every driver has said that they don't agree with it and wanted it changed, but it's a rule, you win some, you lose some. It has benefited them, so well done to them.\" Perhaps now it will be changed. But I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nThe safety car was deployed because it was 'too wet' to race, but most drivers were still on intermediate tyres. What is the point of the full wets? \u2013 Martin It\u2019s a question many drivers also ask. And even Pirelli admits that its full wet tyre - known as the \u2018extreme\u2019 - needs to be improved. Sebastian Vettel used to call it the \"safety-car tyre\". That\u2019s because it was effectively only used when races were controlled under caution, and its use was mandated. The issue is that while the extreme wet clears more water than the intermediate, it lacks grip. So the drivers want to get on to the intermediate as soon as possible because it's faster unless the conditions are really torrential - conditions in which F1 cars generally don\u2019t run because of the danger of such restricted visibility. The 'inter' has good grip, and a wide working window, effective in conditions that are very wet right down to almost dry. This situation will continue until Pirelli can improve the full wet tyre. Boss Mario Isola says they need more testing to do that.\n\nWhat can and can't you change during parc ferme and does this change during the wet or after crashes? \u2013 Joe \u2018Parc ferme\u2019 is a rule that effectively specifies a time beyond which the set-up and specification of the car are fixed. The idea behind it is to reduce costs. On any grand prix weekend, cars are in parc ferme from the start of qualifying to the end of the race. On a sprint weekend, there is a second closed window, from the start of sprint qualifying to the end of the sprint, after which the set-up can be changed before qualifying. The details of parc ferme can be found in article 40 of the sporting regulations on the FIA website, external. But in simple terms, teams can change only the angle of the front wing once the car is in parc ferme, in addition to repairing any damage, as long as the FIA approves it. If the FIA declares a change of climatic conditions, further changes can be made to make the car more suitable for wet weather.",

    "Sir Chris Hoy performed the baton ceremony before the men's cycling sprint finals at this year's Paris Olympics\n\nCyclist Sir Chris Hoy says he has been \"blown away\" by a near eight-fold increase in NHS searches for prostate cancer symptoms since he revealed his terminal diagnosis. The six-time Olympic champion, 48, said at the weekend that doctors have told him he has between two and four years to live. In the 48 hours after he had confirmed the news, NHS England said there were 14,478 visits to their symptoms advice website, compared to 1,876 in the previous week - a rise of 672%. It added the numbers peaked on Sunday with 8,816 visits. In a video posted on social media, external on Thursday, Sir Chris said he had received \"incredible kindness and support\". \"I now have a deep resolve to turn this incredibly difficult diagnosis into something more positive,\" he added. \"I understand that there has been a massive increase in men seeking advice in prostate cancer in the last few days and that's been a huge comfort to us to know that hopefully many lives could be saved by early testing.\" Sir Chris also said that he has written a book titled All That Matters, which will be released in November, about his illness and the story of his life since retiring from professional cycling in 2013. He described the writing experience as cathartic for himself and his family, and said that he hopes the book can provide understanding around how families deal with a terminal diagnosis and to \"remind us that all we have is now\". NHS England's National Clinical Director for Cancer, Professor Peter Johnson said: \"We're very sorry to hear about Chris' prognosis, but his decision to speak so openly about it could save lives by encouraging people to come forward sooner with their symptoms. \"Thanks to his bravery, we have seen a significant spike in people accessing vital information on our website about the signs and symptoms of cancer.\"\n\nSir Chris and Sarra Hoy married in 2010 and share two children\n\nSir Chris won six Olympic golds between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian behind Sir Jason Kenny's tally of seven.

    "Four soldiers have been killed and 58 injured in a drone strike targeting an army base in northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said. The IDF added seven soldiers had been severely injured in the attack on a base \"adjacent to Binyamina\" - a town around 20 miles (33km) to the south of Haifa. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted a training camp of the IDF's Golani Brigade in the area, which is based between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The armed group's media office said the strike was in response to Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon and Beirut on Thursday.\n\nThe group said it targeted the camp in northern Israel using a \"swarm of drones\". The attack was one of the biggest on an Israeli position in more than a year. The Israeli ambulance service, Magen David Adom (MDA), earlier said 61 people had been injured in the attack - including three critically. It added 37 of them had been taken to eight regional hospitals, either by ambulance or helicopter. In a statement before the IDF confirmed the deaths, MDA said that alongside the three critically injured, 18 of the victims were in a moderate condition, 31 sustained mild injuries and nine people were \"suffering anxiety\". The reason for the discrepancy in the number of critical injuries between MDA and the IDF is not clear. Israeli censorship rules had initially prevented media outlets reporting exactly where or what was targeted, before the IDF confirmed it was the Binyamina base. Some Israeli media outlets have reported the base was hit by a low-level drone launched from Lebanon - a relatively unsophisticated weapon that appears not to have activated early-warning alarms. Throughout the evening, television bulletins, social media posts and online reports showed footage of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, taking casualties to hospitals across northern Israel. Many of the wounded have been evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Medical Centre in nearby Hadera - with others being taken to hospitals in Tel Hashomer, Haifa, Afula and Netanya. Details are still scarce but many of the injured appear to have been in a communal canteen at the time and were caught completely by surprise. Images circulating on social media appear to show an empty mess hall with a hole in the roof.",
    "Carer murdered woman, 90, after stealing from her\n\nA carer who hit a \"defenceless and vulnerable\" 90-year-old woman in her own home with a metal flask before smothering her with a pillow has been jailed for murder. The 52-year-old also admitted stealing \u00a360 from Mrs Thompson as well as taking jewellery from other clients. At Liverpool Crown Court, Hill was sentenced to a minimum prison term of 22-and-a-half years.\n\nThe court heard Hill had been sacked by her care agency after she was filmed on a covert camera stealing money from Mrs Thompson. Hill, who has two daughters and four granddaughters, did not tell her partner about losing her job and pretended to still go to work. When questioned by detectives following Mrs Thompson's death, Hill initially denied any involvement. But in a third police interview, she said she had gone to Mrs Thompson's home in Bolde Way, Spital, late one night to apologise and return the money. Hill, who claimed this was all part of an attempt to save her job, said she chose to visit Mrs Thompson late at night so as to avoid being seen by neighbours. She told police that Mrs Thompson had started shouting at her when she let herself in with a key from a keysafe. This was when Hill said she hit her victim with a flask and then, when the 90-year-old continued to shout, smothered her.\n\nMrs Thompson was only 5ft 3in (160cm) tall and weighed less than 7st (45kg). The court also heard she had Parkinson\u2019s disease and leg ulcers, and used a Zimmer frame. Other carers found her to be \"very independent\" and \"very alert\". Prosecutor Nick Johnson KC said: \"This was a planned attack on a defenceless vulnerable woman in her own home which was motivated by either money, revenge or a desire to remove the witness to Jayne Hill\u2019s dishonesty - or a mixture of all three.\" He said Mrs Thompson's body was found at her house by another carer. The court heard that phone data proved Hill, from Wirral, had also gone to her victim's house three days before the murder. Hill's lawyer David Polglase said his client could not properly explain her reaction to being caught stealing. \"She has expressed sorrow and remorse for what she\u2019s done,\" said Mr Polglase. He said Hill, of Norwich Drive in Upton, had no previous convictions but \"fell to temptation\" after financial pressures at home. She was given 20 months for theft and for stealing jewellery from other clients. These sentences will run concurrently with her murder sentence. Judge Andrew Menary KC said: \"The suddenness, ferocity and persistence of the violence you used demonstrates, I am sure, that you went there that night intending to kill your victim. \"You wanted to try to conceal the fact that a crime had been committed by removing the person who you believed was the only possible witness.\"\n\nMyra Thompson cared for her disabled husband for 50 years\n\nAnn Jarvis said her friend and neighbour Mrs Thompson had worked in a caring role all her life at Clatterbridge cancer unit, as well as looking after her disabled husband for 50 years. \"All Myra wanted and deserved was to spend the rest of her days in the comfort of her own home and be treated with the respect and dignity she has shown to others,\" said Mrs Jarvis. The victim's niece, Anne Charters, said: \"We can only imagine the terror she experienced during her final moments on the evening of 23 April in her own home, a place where she was supposed to be safe.\" Det Insp Dave Jones of Merseyside Police described Hill's attack as \"the ultimate breach of trust\". \u201cHill admitted being responsible for Myra\u2019s death and has rightly been sentenced for her monstrous actions,\" he said.\n\u2022 None Carer admits killing woman, 90, in her own home",
    "'Why is my endometriosis treatment not urgent?'\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLara Stevens says endometriosis is like the cancer she had as a child, with the potential to spread and damage multiple organs \u2013 but feels it is not treated with the required urgency. \"The endometriosis could be growing and I wouldn\u2019t know where it is and what it's going to do next,\" said the 36-year-old, who had non-Hodgkin lymphoma aged seven. Gynaecology waiting lists in Wales have increased by 92% in the past four years, yet specialists feel it is seen as less urgent than other surgeries. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is calling for long-term investment in women's health, and the Welsh government said it is a key priority and a women's health plan is due this year.\n\nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines. In rare cases it has even been found in the lungs, eyes, spine and brain. It was once thought that the only place in the body where endometriosis did not occur was the spleen, but in 2020 it was found there also. Symptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods, and the condition is also associated with infertility.\n\n\"I hate to think if I had waited, what could have happened,\" says Lara Stevens\n\nLara said she had been trying to become pregnant for four years, but after a number of miscarriages and additional waits for fertility support, she opted to use her health insurance to have surgery privately. \"I was saddened that it wasn't being seen as a priority, because when I did have my surgery I was riddled with it (endometriosis),\" she said. \"It was all around the back of my bladder, my bowel, it was sitting under both my ovaries, and I hate to think if I had waited, what could have happened.\" The university lecturer, who lives near Cardiff, said she was led to believe at the time there were four or five year waits for surgery. \"I was in my early 30s at that point and didn\u2019t want to be in my late 30s still trying, but also thinking about the damage the endometriosis was doing to my organs. \"No woman knows when their periods are going to end, so you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place.\"\n\nLara fell pregnant soon after surgery to remove endometriosis, and has recently had a second baby. But she said a lesion remains on her bowel and she is likely to need further surgery. She is now under the care of NHS gynaecology services, where waits for routine follow-up appointments can also be lengthy. There are currently more than 50,000 women in Wales waiting for hospital gynaecological services, with nearly half waiting longer than the target of 26 weeks, and more than a third waiting longer than 36 weeks. \"I understand personally why cancer is important,\" she said. \"What I'm saying is maybe this should be seen as just as important, because it's a condition that can be unpredictable, could get worse, and needs to be monitored. \"To be constantly feeling like you\u2019re fighting to get that help, makes it harder.\"\n\nRecent NHS performance figures show four other specialties with waiting lists longer than gynaecology. However, when you take into consideration only those who are eligible for gynaecology, per head of population gynae services are on a par with the worst waits in Wales, and worse than England or Scotland. Geeta Kumar, vice-president for clinical quality at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology, as well as clinical lead for women's services in north Wales, said there were multiple reasons for growing waiting lists. \"Women\u2019s awareness of conditions has increased \u2013 which is for the good, but we also feel that women's health has been de-prioritised for a long period,\" she said.\n\nGeeta Kumar says during Covid one of the most rapidly cancelled lists for treatment was gynaecology\n\nShe said there has been a concerted effort to move away from describing conditions like pelvic pain, prolapse and endometriosis as \"benign gynaecological conditions\" and instead use the term \"non-cancerous\". \"Benign gives the perception that it is not urgent, so when it comes to elective planned lists, compared to other surgical specialties, gynaecology often got de-prioritised,\" she added. The phrase is also viewed by many patients as minimising or trivialising symptoms which Dr Kumar described as \u201cextremely debilitating\u201d. \"Women are reporting not just physical harm, but also their mental wellbeing being affected, even some are not able to leave home because of the condition, whether it's pain or bleeding they\u2019re suffering from.\"\n\nDelyth Jewell MS says many women feel pain is normalised and it takes longer for symptoms to be taken seriously\n\nPlaid Cymru Member of the Senedd (MS) Delyth Jewell, who sits on the cross-party group on women's health in the Senedd, said the delays to see a specialist were compounded when many women felt they have had their symptoms dismissed and battled to be referred. \"Women are too often not believed or told that they have to put up with pain,\" she said. \"They go years with chronic pain - being gaslit, being told that maybe they just are suffering with anxiety, or it\u2019s all in their head.\" In July 2022 the Welsh government published a quality statement on women's health, acknowledging \"significant disparities in care between men and women\".

    "Inquiry into poisoning of Dawn Sturgess to start\n\nDawn Sturgess, 44, did not know the perfume she was spraying herself with was a lethal nerve agent\n\nA public inquiry is to begin later in Salisbury, to examine how a woman from Wiltshire was killed by a 2018 poisoning blamed on Russian agents. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after coming into contact with Novichok - the same chemical weapon used to target a former Russian spy four months earlier. The nerve agent had been hidden inside a designer perfume bottle. The inquiry will examine the circumstances leading to her death, try to establish where responsibility lies and highlight any lessons.\n\nThe first week of evidence will be heard at the Guildhall in Salisbury. Monday\u2019s session will begin at 11:00 BST with a day of opening statements. On Tuesday, the inquiry will hear about Ms Sturgess from her mother, Caroline Sturgess. The rest of the week will focus on evidence and experiences from the local first responders, including paramedics and Wiltshire Police. After a week\u2019s break, the inquiry will move to central London where it will hear details relating to the targeting of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the former Russian spy and his daughter, who had been poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury in March 2018.\n\nIt will also hear about Operation Verbasco, the police investigation into the Novichok incident. Due to national security, the public feed of the hearings will be on a short delay \u2013 and some evidence will be heard in private. The UK authorities blame the Russian state for the use of the chemical weapon, believing Russian agents were behind the original incident and then discarded the perfume bottle. It was later found by Ms Sturgess\u2019s partner Charlie Rowley \u2013 both thought it was designer perfume. Mr Rowley was taken ill at the same time as Ms Sturgess, but he later recovered. Russia has consistently denied any involvement and the Russian embassy has described the public inquiry as a \u201ccircus\u201d. Public hearings are due to conclude in the first week of December, before a final report is published in 2025.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

    "Son of Norwegian princess arrested on suspicion of rape\n\nMarius Borg H\u00f8iby is in a detention centre in Oslo, Norwegian police said\n\nThe son of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit has been arrested on suspicion of rape. Marius Borg H\u00f8iby, 27, is the stepson of the heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon, but does not a have a royal title or official duties. On Tuesday, Norwegian police said Mr H\u00f8iby had been charged with sexual intercourse with \"someone who is unconscious or for other reasons is unable to resist the act\". Mr H\u00f8iby, who has reportedly denied the rape allegation, is facing a number of charges for offences allegedly committed against four other victims.\n\nIn a statement, police said the rape \"concerns [a] sexual act without intercourse\" and that the victim was \"said to have been unable to resist the act\". According to local reports, the Norwegian palace has declined to comment on the latest arrest of Mr H\u00f8iby. Mr H\u00f8iby was arrested by police at 23:12 (22:12 GMT) on Monday in a car with a victim from a separate incident. In relation to this separate incident, on 4 August, he faces charges of violence and criminal damage. Police said, external on Tuesday that the charges had been expanded to include \"maltreatment\" in close relationships and \"another violation\" of a restraining order against the same victim. They added that a report had been made for driving without a valid driver's licence. Mr H\u00f8iby's residence at Skaugum, close to where the crown prince and his wife live, has also been searched by police.

Southampton 'are one of the best in the Premier League' - Pep Guardiola\n\nSouthampton were beaten at Manchester City, as most people expected. They are bottom of the Premier League, with a single point from their first nine games of the season. Manager Russell Martin is under pressure, despite guiding Saints back to the top flight only five months ago. Speaking to the media after Saturday's 1-0 result, both managers heaped praise on the beaten team. It was not so much that they were unlucky to lose. If Erling Haaland had a better day, he would have scored more than just the fifth-minute match-winner. Manchester City beat Southampton in an open game - not just because they found a way through a blanket defence. Towards the end of the first half, the visitors had the majority of possession. It was down to 42.3% by the end. As a guide, City\u2019s previous two opponents, Sparta Prague and Wolves, have had 20.1% and 22.4% respectively. If Southampton are to go down, or Martin is to lose his job, it will be by committing to a gameplan he believes in. \"I took the job [at MK Dons] nearly five years ago, with the club in the League One relegation zone and the chairman saying he didn't care if they got relegated if he could see something he believed in and could be proud of,\" said Martin. \"There have been some moments of real difficulty at MK and Swansea and here, where you get questioned and have to make a big decision. \"But if I end up losing my job at some point, which is inevitable, at least I can say I have stuck to what I want to be, as a person first, then a leader and then as a manager. \"To get to the Premier League and then change would be illogical. I cannot stand on the sidelines watching something I don't feel connected with or love. I don't see the point in that.\" That requires Southampton's players to have courage to take the ball in tight areas, carry on passing when the pressure is at its greatest and not allow poor results or adversity to change that mindset.\n\nSouthampton manager Russell Martin was praised by counterpart Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's 1-0 win at Etihad Stadium\n\nThe circumstances are significantly different - given the size of the club he was going into, and the knowledge he could call on generational talents in Xavi and Andres Iniesta, and the man he regards as the greatest ever in Lionel Messi - but Pep Guardiola needed to do something similar when he was given the Barcelona job, aged 37 - a year younger than Martin is now. Now revered as one of the greatest managers in history, Guardiola appreciates what Martin is doing and even feels there are aspects of Southampton's play he can learn from. \"We were not sloppy, we were not flat, but we struggled to regain the ball because they are really good,\" said the City boss. \"I'm a spectator. I prefer the players to get the ball to feet, not the teeth. \"When I see the opponent do the things I like to do with my team and they do it really well, I make a compliment. \"I'm sure I will learn, there were some movements, the reasons why they do things, the movements they make to link to the striker. It's not easy.\u201d He added on Sky Sports: \"It's a good game to learn as a manager. I am going to learn a lot with Russell because they did really well.\" Guardiola did not just praise Martin to the media, he also spoke to the Saints boss straight after the final whistle - and Martin revealed City and England playmaker Phil Foden had also done so. \"They felt we were really brave with the ball and did stuff not many teams do,\" said Martin. \"It is not easy to play that way but he probably understands it more than anyone. \"I have seen so many teams promoted and get nowhere. If we lose I can accept it when the lads show a level of courage like they did today. If they do that here they can do it anywhere. \"I will live and die by the sword for what I believe in. If we keep playing like we did today we will have some fun and be all right.\" Fun might be an extreme way of describing Southampton's current predicament. Pressure can scramble the mind and - after throwing away a victory against Ipswich in injury time and losing a two-goal lead in the final half-hour against Leicester - the forthcoming games against Everton and Wolves look huge for Martin and his side's survival hopes. If the former Scotland international can really have fun in games like that, he deserves all the success that comes his way.",
    "Melania Trump is latest Republican First Lady to back abortion\n\nMelania Trump seems to have joined a long line of Republican former first ladies who have come out in support of abortion rights, putting them at odds with their husbands' public views. In a short video clip promoting her forthcoming book, Mrs Trump expressed her support for women's \"individual freedom\", describing it as an \"essential right that all women possess from birth\". It comes a day after an excerpt of her soon-to-be-released memoir, in which she reportedly takes an even clearer pro-choice stance, was published in a newspaper report. Mrs Trump's apparent stance on the issue appears to contrast with the position of her husband, who has taken credit for helping overturn Roe v Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBut it follows a decades-long American tradition of Republican first ladies who - since Roe v Wade was first decided in 1973 - have said legal abortion access should be protected. In 1975, while still in the White House, First Lady Betty Ford called the Roe ruling a \"great, great decision\". Nancy Reagan waited until her husband, President Ronald Reagan, left office before she said publicly that she \"believed in a woman's choice\", but her position on the issue was reportedly well known within the White House. Barbara Bush, wife of President George HW Bush, and her daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, wife of President George W Bush, were similar, revealing their stance on the issue after their husbands left the White House. \"I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons,\" Laura Bush said in a 2010 interview promoting her memoir. In a black-and-white video posted on her X account on Thursday, Mrs Trump said \"there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom\". \"What does my body, my choice really mean?\" Mrs Trump continued. The video comes one day after The Guardian, external published an excerpt from her new book, Melania, set to be released on 8 October. In the excerpt, quoted by the Guardian, she writes: \u201cIt is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.\" \u201cWhy should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman\u2019s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,\" she continues. \u201cRestricting a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. \"I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\u201d Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of the book First Women, said she was \"shocked\" by the comments. \"So shocked that I wanted to check it was real,\" she said. \"She's very much been in line with her husband, so on this issue how did she spend all those years watching him derail something that she seems to care about?\" More than the other first ladies, Ms Brower said, Mrs Trump's comments appear \"diametrically opposed\" to her husband's approach on the issue. And she is the only first lady so far to make her stance on abortion known while her husband is actively seeking re-election. Indeed, the timing of Mrs Trump's comments suggest a possible political angle, Ms Brower said. \"It's not out of the realm of possibility that this was done intentionally to come out right before the election, because it could appeal to those swing state voters who are upset about the overturning of Roe v Wade,\" she said. \"Maybe they could see this as a sign that he [Trump] perhaps is softening on abortion.\" The notion of Mrs Trump trying to help out her husband \"doesn\u2019t track with the Melania we know\", she said. \"At this point in the game it doesn\u2019t change anything, and she knows that,\" Ms Shah said. \"Early ballots have already gone out in certain places. It\u2019s just too late.\" Abortion access is a key issue in next month's 2024 election - and it is considered a weak point for the Republican Party, which has struggled to appeal to a conservative base that opposes the procedure and a wider electorate that supports abortion access, external. Throughout the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump's position on the issue has fluctuated. Earlier this week, the Republican presidential nominee said for the first time that he would veto any federal abortion ban in the unlikely event that such a measure ever passed Congress. The BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has sought to capitalise on Trump's position in an effort to galvanise voters. She has regularly cast Trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of the overturning of Roe v Wade, which took place after he appointed a conservative majority to the Supreme Court. \u201cSadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump\u2019s husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,\" Sarafina Chitika, a spokeswoman for the Harris-Walz campaign told the BBC.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Steve Borthwick took over as England coach two years ago after a miserable autumn campaign in 2022 prompted Eddie Jones' departure\n\nCoverage: Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe soft centre of a southern hemisphere sandwich. That is how Saturday\u2019s encounter with Australia appeared when England revealed their 2024 autumn fixtures. Between ever-competitive New Zealand and world champions South Africa, England play an Australia team they have beaten in 10 of their previous 11 meetings - a run that began after England's pool-stage defeat in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. More recent form doesn't challenge the perception either. Australia have lost five of their last six matches. They finished bottom of the Rugby Championship. Last year's Rugby World Cup campaign ended in a miserable pool-stage exit. They are ranked ninth in the world, below Italy and a smidge above Fiji. The current crop of Wallabies are certainly short of bounce. They can, however, still box. Canny coaches, blockbuster talent and a cherished underdog status give the tourists a puncher's chance at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham on Saturday. And, given their wobbly form, England are certainly not invulnerable to an upset. Steve Borthwick's side themselves have only one win - a comfortable cruise past Japan - from their last five fixtures. Several times in that run, they have been locked on for the winners' enclosure, only to veer into the rails in the final quarter. Their ability to fade faster than a boil wash is stark. Among the top 10 teams in the world this year, none have scored more points than the 77 England have chalked up between 40 minutes and 60 minutes in matches. But, contrastingly, none have scored fewer than the 35 they have managed from the hour mark to full-time. England have a points difference of 47 from 40-60 minutes in matches this year. They are minus 23 from the final quarter. The way that an eight-point lead evaporated late on against All Blacks last weekend swung the spotlight onto England\u2019s bench. Replacement fly-half George Ford missed two potentially match-winning shots. Scrum-half Harry Randall struggled to connect with his team-mates. The rejigged forwards went into retreat.\n\nRandall and Ford came on just after an hour played against New Zealand, with their side 22-14 up\n\nBorthwick has made changes in the hope his finishers can match up to the job description. All-brawn Luke Cowan-Dickie comes into the squad in place of all-court Theo Dan. The six-two split on the bench between forwards and backs has been abandoned in favour of a more conventional five-three split, meaning the pack won't be shuffled as dramatically in the closing stages. The only change to the starting XV is a positional switch in midfield, with Ollie Lawrence swapping to outside centre and Henry Slade coming inside to 12. The theory is that it should enable Lawrence - restricted to two carries against New Zealand - to get the ball in more space. However, the revival of a dual playmaker shape that worked fitfully under Eddie Jones has potential weaknesses. Slade will have to lead the backline defence from a different perspective, clocking dangers both inside and outside. Just back from shoulder surgery, he is also placed in the high-traffic lane where Lawrence made 27 tackles against the All Blacks. Len Ikitau - Australia's hard-running inside centre - is sure to test Slade early. On the other side of the ball, England certainly need something to spark their attack. Against New Zealand, they were heavy on perspiration, but light on inspiration. England's solitary try came from a smart Marcus Smith intercept of a ponderous pass, but they rarely looked as if they could pick a way though the defence via their own wit. Among the world\u2019s top 10 nations, only Wales have been less efficient in turning entries into the 22 into points this year. England have some fine attacking talents. But, whether it is the system or individuals within it, potential has not been cashed in as points. If it had, their last four defeats - all by a converted score or less - could have been very different. England's repeated failure to get over the horizon and out of sight will give 5-1 outsiders Australia hope. The instant installation of Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii in the backline will add to it, even if the weight of expectation will surely sit heavy on the 21-year-old.\n\nSuaalii was part of the Samoa team that beat England in the Rugby League World Cup semi-final at London's Emirates Stadium\n\nAn age-grade phenomenon, Suaalii has been brought back to union from rugby league in a statement move aimed at galvanising a team and reinvigorating a sport. For all the dollar signs and headlines though, his first game of union since his school days will come at Test level, with unfamiliar team-mates alongside him and 80,000 fans in front of him. Head coach Joe Schmidt admitted picking Suaalii is a gamble, and that it was one that might not pay off immediately. \"If not now, when?\" said the New Zealander. \"I think it makes some sense for him to play. It's unlikely it'll go perfectly, but it will be a benchmark that he can build from.\" Angus Bell and 23-stone tighthead Taniela Tupou are formidable foundations and the props will relish the chance to get at England at the set-piece. The back row of captain Harry Wilson, Rob Valetini and Fraser McReight have been star performers. Twenty-year-old wing Max Jorgensen, who starts on the bench, was almost as highly hyped as Suaalii coming up through school. Perhaps most importantly, Schmidt, who sculpted Ireland's intricate patterns between 2013 and 2019, is in the stands. His steady hand is even more critical than Suaalii's stardust in Australia's revival. So far under him improvement has been incremental. Victory over England would be a dramatic break-out success. It would also send Steve Borthwick's men plunging in the opposite direction before the visit of the Springboks. For all Australia's points of promise, it is a game England should win. But, as the Twickenham regulars can attest, there have been plenty of those. And, once the final whistle had blown, markedly fewer victories.",
    "Donald Trump attends his criminal trial in New York\n\nNew York prosecutors have vowed to oppose President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s effort to overturn his criminal conviction, but they expressed a willingness to wait to sentence him until he completes his upcoming presidential term. Prosecutors urged the judge who is overseeing Trump's sentence after his guilty verdict to consider options other than dismissal, including holding off until the president-elect is scheduled to leave the White House in 2029. The Manhattan district attorney's office asked Justice Juan Merchan to set a new deadline of 9 December for both sides to consider the case and file new motions. Trump's sentencing is scheduled for 26 November, but it could be delayed further.\n\nIn May, Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from an attempt to cover up a potential sex scandal ahead of his first presidential victory in 2016. A few weeks later, however, the US Supreme Court held in a separate case that presidents enjoy a degree of immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts.\" Trump's lawyers want a judge to overturn his New York conviction on the grounds of presidential immunity, and because of his impending term in the White House. On Wednesday, attorney Todd Blanche called for the \"immediate dismissal of this case,\" and argued such an outcome was required by the US Constitution and the Presidential Transition Act. Mr Blanche asked for a deadline of 20 December to file a full brief with the court. Prosecutors believe the issues at the centre of their case do not have to do with official presidential duties. They stressed that the trial and conviction occurred before the US Supreme Court decided this summer that presidents had broad protection from criminal prosecution. They did acknowledge Justice Merchan's \"need to balance competition consititutional interests\", however. They asked the judge to consider \"non-dismissal options\" that could included \"deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of Defendant's upcoming presidential term\". \u201cThe DA is saying that the court should put off sentencing until after Trump leaves the White House,\" said New York attorney and former prosecutor Mitchell Epner. \"Don\u2019t drop the conviction - but don\u2019t do anything until after Trump leaves office.\" With Trump's inauguration just weeks away, little time remained on the calendar for a new round of motions and briefs, Mr Epner said. The case would be paused anyway after 20 January, when Trump takes the oath of office, he said. Of the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, the New York case was the only one to go to trial and reach a guilty verdict. But the final outcome is now uncertain as Trump prepares to head to the White House next January. Nevertheless, Trump's spokesman Steven Cheung - who has been tapped to serve as White House director of communications - declared \"total and definitive victory\". Justice Merchan has yet to rule on the matter, however. Former Manhattan prosecutor Diana Florence said that this request makes it doubtful that Trump would face sentencing at the scheduled hearing on 26 November, as the judge will probably accept the prosecutors' proposal. \"I think there's less than half a percent chance that he'd be sentenced next week,\" she said. The judge has a range of options for Trump's sentence, including fines, probation and a four-year prison sentence - though legal experts say the president-elect could avoid any legal punishment. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg first charged Trump with falsifying business records in April 2023, accusing the president-elect of a hush-money scheme in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors said that Trump tried to disguise reimbursements to his personal attorney, who had paid off an adult film star with whom Trump allegedly had an affair. Because of the scheme's proximity to the election, they claimed it amounted to election interference. Trump maintained his innocence, denied that the affair ever occurred and alleged the case was a form of political persecution. But in May, a jury of 12 New Yorkers found the president-elect guilty. Trump's sentencing hearing was delayed multiple times. The court agreed to hold off any decisions until today while all parties sorted out the historic implications of his re-election.",

Officials say tests found the balls to be formed from chemicals similar to those in cosmetics and cleaning products but it is still unclear where they came from.

'Youth guarantee' to focus on 'earning or learning'\n\nYoung people who refuse to work will face having their benefits cut, the work and pensions secretary has said. Liz Kendall told the BBC the government will offer young people the opportunity to \"earn or learn\" under new proposals to be unveiled on Tuesday. \"In return for those new opportunities young people will have a responsibility to take them up,\" she said. Official figures published earlier this week showed that nearly a million young people were out of education, employment or training between July and September.\n\nUnder new measures to reform the welfare system, a \"Youth Guarantee\" for 18 to 21-year-olds aims to train young people or get them back into work. Kendall told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg these proposals would see an overhaul of the apprenticeship system so \"more people have the chance to train\" with young people offered \"the opportunity to be earning or learning\". Asked if those who did not take up these offers would lose benefits, Kendall replied: \"Yes.\" She said this would transform opportunities for young people. \"If you are out of work when you\u2019re young that can have lifelong consequences in terms of your future job prospects and earning potential.\"\n\nIn an op-ed in the Mail on Sunday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised that the benefits overhaul would crack down on \"criminals\" who \"game the system\". Kendall told the BBC that she believed there were people who can work but refused to do so, but said she thought these people were \"in the minority\" of benefit claimants. Economic inactivity has grown rapidly since the pandemic. There are now 9.3 million people who are neither in work nor looking for a job - a rise of 713,000 since Covid. Nearly three million people are out of work due to ill health, a 500,000 increase since 2019. Asked about the rise in benefit claimants in recent years, Kendall said some people have \"self-diagnosed\" mental health problems, as well as those \"diagnosed by doctors\" - but added that there was a \"genuine problem\" with mental health in the UK.\n\nKevin Hollinrake said there were \"incentives in the system\" for people to leave work and claim benefits\n\nUnder the previous Conservative government's plans to tighten eligibility for incapacity benefits, an estimated 400,000 people signed off work long-term would have lost payments. The work and pensions secretary refused to confirm whether those people would keep their benefits under Labour's proposals. \"We will deliver those savings, we will bring forward our own reforms,\" she said.\n\nShadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said that rising numbers of people out of work due to ill health was \"a phenomenon caused largely by the pandemic\". He said the previous government had been \"dealing with it\" and welcomed Labour's focus on the issue, but added: \"I want to make sure they do the right things rather than just talk a good game.\"\n\nAre you a young person in work or receiving benefits?",
    "Max Verstappen is the fourth man to win four consecutive drivers' championships\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen won his fourth consecutive World Drivers\u2019 Championship with fifth place in the Las Vegas Grand Prix. The race was won by Mercedes' George Russell, who held off a charge by team-mate Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time champion taking second place from 10th on the grid. Verstappen\u2019s position behind the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc was more than enough for the Dutchman. His title rival Lando Norris could manage only sixth for McLaren, his deficit to the Dutchman now 63 points with a maximum of 60 available. Verstappen joins Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel as a four-time champion, with only Hamilton, Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio ahead of him in that list. \"What a season,\" Verstappen said to his team over the radio. \"It was a little more difficult than last season, but we pulled through.\" He added: \u201cIt has been a long season and we started amazing, almost like cruising, and then we had a tough run but we kept it together as a team, kept working on improvements and pulled it over the line. \"To stand here as a four-time world champion is something I never thought possible so standing here relieved in a way but also proud.\u201d\n\nVictory in Las Vegas is Mercedes' fourth grand prix win this season, with Russell and Hamilton taking two each\n\nThird and fourth places for the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc reduced their deficit to McLaren in the constructors\u2019 championship to 24 points with two races to go. Norris stopped for fresh tyres to take fastest lap in the closing stages to give McLaren an extra point. Verstappen, starting one place ahead of Norris in fifth place on the grid, headed his rival throughout a relatively quiet race for the Red Bull driver as Russell took control from the start. Verstappen's measured performance was aimed at securing the title at the first chance he had, and he did so with the calmness and aplomb with which he has driven for the vast majority of the year. Russell controlled the race from the front, fending off an early challenge from Leclerc, who jumped from fourth on the grid to second past Alpine's Pierre Gasly and then Sainz around the first two corners. And as Leclerc then squabbled with the recovering Sainz, and the Ferraris then ran into tyre trouble before Mercedes and Verstappen, Russell stretched out his lead to take control of the race. Hamilton ran 10th in the early laps, but drove a superb first stint, fast while also keeping his tyres in shape.\n\nHe vaulted up on to the back of the lead group by delaying his first stop, and passed Norris shortly after it. The seven-time champion then set about challenging the Ferraris, with Verstappen at this point second ahead of Sainz and Leclerc, having overtaken the red cars with a later pit stop. But Hamilton, lacking straight-line speed in his Mercedes, was unable to make progress past the red cars. Instead, Mercedes made a second pit stop on lap 27, a lap before Sainz and four laps before Leclerc, and Hamilton used his pace to emerge in second place. He caught Verstappen with a succession of fastest laps and swept by on the straight on lap 31. Russell followed Leclerc in on lap 32, and for a few laps after his stop Hamilton took chunks out of his team-mate\u2019s lead, getting it down from 11.2 seconds to 7.4 in seven laps. But it soon became clear that Russell had the race under control, and he led Hamilton to an unexpected one-two. Behind them, the Ferraris closed back in on Verstappen after their final pit stops and both passed him in the final 10 laps.

    "Europe's Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald said Sergio Garcia \"was very interested\" about rejoining the tour when the pair spoke recently\n\nLIV Golf's Sergio Garcia is set to rejoin the DP World Tour for the 2025 season as he seeks to play at next year's Ryder Cup. Garcia, 44, who is the event's record points scorer, wants to match Lee Westwood and Sir Nick Faldo's European record of 11 appearances at the biennial competition. However, in order for that to happen, the Spaniard has had to settle the outstanding substantial fines - reported to be more than \u00a31m - imposed on him by the tour for his previous defection to play LIV events, and he will also have to serve a suspension. A spokesman for the Europe-based DP World Tour confirmed former Masters winner Garcia submitted an application to return to the membership before the 17 November deadline. European players wishing to be selected for the Ryder Cup must be members of the tour. \"He has paid his fines but will have to serve his suspensions before he can play on the DP World Tour,\" the spokesman added. The 2025 Ryder Cup takes place at Bethpage in New York from 26-28 September. Europe's captain Luke Donald recently said he had been speaking to Garcia about the Spanish star returning to the tour and becoming eligible to play on the team. Garcia has won 16 titles on the European tour, as well as 11 PGA Tour titles, with his 2017 Masters title counting in both tallies. He joined the breakaway LIV Golf, a Saudi-funded series, in 2022 along with other big names from the sport. He resigned his membership of the European circuit in May 2023 after an arbitration panel found in favour of the DP World Tour and confirmed its right to fine and ban players who competed in LIV Golf events without permission.\n\nGarcia has made no secret of his desire to return to the European Ryder Cup team and clearly believes a fine of more than \u00a31m is worth paying to make himself available for next year's match at Bethpage. The all-time record points scorer missed Europe's triumph in Rome but has a long friendship with captain Luke Donald that stretches back to their successful playing partnership in previous matches. Clearly the attraction of playing under Donald in New York next year has proven irresistible to Garcia. He will need to play four events next season, after missing events for which he has been suspended, to maintain his renewed membership. Garcia remains suspended from the PGA Tour, as are all players still competing on the breakaway LIV circuit. But the Spaniard is not alone in paying DP World Tour fines with Adrian Meronk, Dean Burmester, Joaquin Niemann, Thomas Pieters, Patrick Reed and Lucas Herbert all reinstating their memberships. Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton remain members until their appeals against fines are heard. This is unlikely to happen before the Ryder Cup.",
    "The family shop saying goodbye after 64 years\n\nThe shop has always been a family affair - as this picture from the past showing Alan (far right) and son Lee (second from left) plus other family members illustrates\n\nAlan Hartley was never supposed to open a fruit and veg shop. A career in engineering was on the cards for the-then 19-year-old, but Alan's eyes and heart were set on running his own mobile store. He spoke to mum Janet and dad Albert and had a chat with the council about his options. In November 1960, while still a teenager, he took control of an empty unit at what would become known as the Gaunt Shopping Centre - it wasn't on wheels, but it was his. On Friday, 64 years later, Alan pulled down the shutter for the final time on local retail institution AE Hartley & Son. When we meet him, Alan, now 83, surveys the scene around the shop, including new buildings and the empty neighbouring stores in which the tills went quiet a long time ago. \"We'd be looking at a field now,\" he says, gazing across the concrete precinct. \"Not a big brick wall at the back of a chemist. The view was definitely better then.\"\n\nThe family swapped green and white pinnies for fleeces\n\nThree generations of the Hartley family, wearing the matching blue fleeces introduced by the business 15 years ago, are standing inside the shop. They are happily reminiscing about the memories that have been created over butter, potatoes, toothpaste and toilet cleaner during the years they have worked there. A steady stream of customers comes through the door to offer well wishes. Some leave cards. Many are emotional. \"We've had tears from several customers. I'm saving mine for a bit,\" says Janet, Alan's 89-year-old sister who has been at his side since the start. She left a job in insurance, deciding that working with family in the shop suited her better. \"We're a big family. That\u2019s our strength. When it's backs to the wall. We present a united front,\" she adds.\n\nAlan (right) opened the store aged just 19 alongside his older sister Janet (left)\n\nFor the first few years the shop, named after Alan\u2019s father Albert Edward Hartley, simply sold fruit and veg. Fresh produce was lined up and displayed in boxes outside the front of the store on a well-swept pavement in the Gleadless area, about three miles south east of Sheffield city centre. Potatoes would arrive in huge wooden crates and have to be lugged up from the cellar. Alan\u2019s eldest son Lee, now 51, remembers watching on a child as his father and grandfather struggled with the \"back-breaking work\" of moving huge quantities of potatoes around. \"In the early 60s people weren\u2019t eating rice and pasta so we sold tonnes and tonnes of spuds. \"After a couple of years Dad realised the heavy lifting would kill him so he invested in a conveyer belt,\" he says. The original 1960s conveyer belt is still in operation today. Lee proudly fires it up to demonstrate its deafening whirl. The family are now looking into transferring it to a local museum.\n\nThe store has moved with the times - but also kept its own traditions including the locally renowned eggs\n\nLooking out across the shop from a stool perched behind the counter, Janet reflects on the current dwindling stock, deliberately run down before closure. In the far corner is a tall glass-fronted fridge, it is half-empty and contains energy drinks. \"I remember when they wheeled that in. \"We didn't know where to put it. It seemed so big,\" she says. \"We used to sell old glass bottles of Tizer and Dandelion and Burdock. \"People used to have it with their Sunday dinner,\" she recollects with a smile. A chest freezer followed. It's currently stocked with frozen pizzas and sausages. \"People purchase food differently. They just don't shop local anymore,\" she explains.\n\nThe shop sits in the heart of the Gaunt Shopping Centre\n\nLee ended up taking over the day-to-day running in the 1990s and despite only being in charge for a mere 30 years or so, he is clear on what has kept the business alive while others around have floundered and fallen. \"Adapt or die,\" he tells me, standing near a shelf where birthday candles and soap jostle for the pre-eminent position. \"When the supermarkets became more and more popular, all the shops around us started closing; the newsagent and bakers. \"We realised that we had to diversify and start stocking those products for our customers.\" Now behind the counter where there used to be a vat of loose dirty potatoes sits a neat row of greeting cards, wrapping paper and helium balloons. Time and the march of purchasing progress has not swept all before it in the shop just yet, though. Eggs can still be bought individually from a huge pile behind the counter. Customers know to return their old egg boxes to be re-used.\n\nThe shop has changed stock to suit customer tastes - including now selling sharon fruit to Sue\n\nSue Denton, 63, has been coming to the store for 40 years. She's brought flowers for the family and is buying some sharon fruit \u2013 something the shop didn't stock when it opened for the first time. \"It's near on, they sell everything. It\u2019s like a family for me. \"I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do now,\" she says. Mick Pearson, 68 comes in every day. He jokes: \"I come in to be abused. I\u2019m going to starve when they close.\"\n\nThis was the scene in the year 2000 when the store celebrated 40 years of trading\n\nAccording to the youngest generation of the Hartley clan, Jamie, 19, and Amy,18, the \"legendary\" pick-n-mix sweet boxes have also stayed the same over the years since their grandfather first opened up. Amy, talking about a bag containing a mix of cheaper sweets, insists: \"It's the only place round here you can get a proper good mix up.\" The teenage pair tease each other about child labour and who started working at the shop first. \"Put it this way, there\u2019s a photo of me as a baby in the sweetie weighing scales,\" laughs Jamie.\n\nAmy and Jamie are the latest generation of the family to work in the store\n\nOver the years the shop's nostalgic vibe has also caught the attention of TV producers. The exterior was used for the 1980s-set ITV underwear drama Brief Encounter, while in 2022 the Disney TV series of Sheffield-based The Full Monty used the store as a newsagents. Getting ready for the shop to close for the last time, Lee, who is moving into catering and currently converting a horse box for a new coffee business, admitted it would be a very difficult day: \"I'm very sad. I grew up with these people that come in, sad times are coming.\" Alan\u2019s hands-off approach has allowed him to see more than his shop counter for the past few years. He and wife Pat have enjoyed cruises to as far afield as Australia and China - and hope to explore further in their proper retirement. \"I'm ready for a rest but I'll miss the customers so much. They're more like friends.\"",
    "United by loyalty, Trump's new team have competing agendas\n\nIf personnel really does amount to policy, then we\u2019ve learned a lot this week about how Donald Trump intends to govern in his second term. More than a dozen major appointments, some of which will require Senate approval, offer a clearer picture of the team entrusted to drive his agenda as he returns to the White House. On the outside they appear united by one thing - loyalty to the top man. But beneath the surface, there are competing agendas. Here are four factions that reveal both Trump\u2019s ambition and potential tricky tests ahead for his leadership.\n\nTheir agenda: This trio have been among the most vocal politicians actively opposing US policies, particularly under President Biden. Choosing Gaetz as his attorney general nominee is possibly Trump\u2019s most controversial pick. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. A graduate of William and Mary Law School, he led the removal of California congressman Kevin McCarthy as the sitting Speaker of the House in October 2023. He has come under investigation by a House ethics committee for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl, using illegal drugs and misusing campaign funds. He denies wrongdoing and no criminal charges have been filed.\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week Tulsi Gabbard, picked to be Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, is a military veteran who served with a medical unit in Iraq. She is a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who switched parties to support Trump. Gabbard has routinely opposed American foreign policy, blaming Nato for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 then casting doubt on US intelligence assessments blaming Assad for using chemical weapons. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee health, is a longtime lawyer and environmentalist. He also spread fringe theories \u2013 about vaccines and the effects of 5G phone signals.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A look at Trump's cabinet and key roles... in 74 seconds\n\nWhat this tells us: Like Trump, Gaetz, Gabbard and Kennedy are aggressive challengers of the status quo. All three frequently tip over into conspiracy. They may be among the most determined supporters of Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d. The president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health. But bomb-throwers can also make unruly subordinates. Kennedy wants stricter regulation across food and farming industries, which may collide with Trump\u2019s government-slashing agenda. Gaetz\u2019s views on some issues - he favours legalisation of marijuana - are outside the Republican mainstream. And Gabbard, a fierce critic of American power, will be working for a president who is not afraid to use it - for instance, against Iran.\n\u2022 None What RFK could do on vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nTheir agenda: The three hardliners tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s border and immigration policies have vowed to strengthen security and clamp down on undocumented immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. Domestically, they - and the wider incoming Trump administration - have called for a drastic uptick in deportations, beginning with those considered national security or public safety threats, and a return to workplace \u201cenforcement operations\u201d that were paused by the Biden administration.\n\nWhat it tells us: Aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with Mexico were primary concerns for many voters. The possibility of increased deportations and workplace raids, however, could put Trump on a collision course with Democratic-leaning states and jurisdictions that may decide to push back or not co-operate. Some Republican states - whose economies rely, in part, on immigrant labour - may also object.\n\nTheir agenda: Trump has named the world\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk, to lead a cost-cutting effort dubbed the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d. He will share the role with 39-year-old investor-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy, who became an ardent Trump backer after bowing out as a candidate in the Republican primary. The two men are among the loudest and flashiest tech bros, a group that swung towards Trump this year, seeking a champion to disavow \u201cwoke\u201d political correctness and embrace a libertarian vision of small government, low taxes and light regulation. Musk has floated a possible $2tn in spending cuts, vowing to send \u201cshockwaves\u201d through the government. Ramaswamy, who has backed eliminating the tax-collecting agency, the IRS, and the Department of Education, among others, wrote after the announcement: \u201cShut it down.\u201d\n\nWhat it tells us: The appointments are an acknowledgment of the help Trump got on the campaign trail from Ramaswamy and Musk, the latter of whom personally ploughed more than $100m into the campaign. But time will tell what power this faction goes on to have. Despite its name, the department is not an official agency. The commission will stand outside the government to advise on spending, which is partly controlled by Congress. Trump, who ran up budget deficits during his first term, has shown little commitment to cutting spending. He has promised to leave Social Security and Medicare - two of the biggest areas of government spending - untouched, which could make cost-cutting difficult. RFK Jr\u2019s pledge to increase regulation of food additives and ultra-processed foods could also clash with Musk and Ramaswamy\u2019s mandate to cut red tape.\n\nTheir agenda: These men will run Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. They are all hawks on China. Rubio, nominee for secretary of state, is among Beijing\u2019s harshest critics, having argued for travel bans on some Chinese officials and for the closure of Hong Kong\u2019s US trade offices. The three are likely to push through Trump\u2019s pledge for much higher tariffs on Chinese imports. They see Beijing as the top economic and security threat to the US. Waltz - picked for national security adviser - has said the US is in a \u201cCold War\u201d with the ruling communist party. Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director who served as an intelligence chief in his first term, has likened countering China\u2019s rise to the defeat of fascism or bringing down the Iron Curtain.\n\nWhat it tells us: While Trump often signals his own hawkish economic views on China, he has also vacillated - which could spark tensions with his top foreign policy team. In his first term, Trump triggered a trade war with Beijing (attempts to de-escalate this failed amid the pandemic) and relations slumped further when he labelled Covid the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d. But he also heaped praise on President Xi Jinping as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader ruling with an \u201ciron fist\u201d. This unpredictability could make managing America\u2019s most consequential strategic relationship even harder. Rubio might also clash with Gabbard, Trump\u2019s pick for director of intelligence, who previously criticised him on foreign policy, saying he \"represents the neocon, warmongering establishment\".",

This bill is an improvement - EFL chair\n\nEnglish Football League chairman Rick Parry says he hopes a \"seminal\" review of the game by a new independent regulator could help overcome years of deadlock with the Premier League over greater financial redistribution. Strengthened legislation to establish a body to oversee the elite men's club game was relaunched by the government last month, and begins its second reading in parliament on Wednesday. About 40 peers are scheduled to speak in the House of Lords before any potential amendments are debated. Parry says the Football Governance Bill is \"an improvement\" on a version introduced by the previous government, and which failed to become law before the General Election was called in May. In a wide-ranging interview, he also told BBC Sport:\n\u2022 None concerns that the regulator could impact the Premier League\u2019s competitiveness were \"nonsense\"\n\u2022 None he expects the regulator to provide \"consistency of regulation\" amid a \"willingness [by] clubs at the drop of a hat to challenge the whole system\", warning that the game \"will grind to a halt unless we find a solution for that\"\n\u2022 None the parachute payments to clubs relegated from the Premier League have got \"way too big\", and it was \"intellectually incoherent\" to exclude them from the regulator\u2019s scope in the original legislation\n\u2022 None he \"passionately believes\" that the coach of the national team should be English.\n\nThe landmark legislation will give the regulator powers to assess the impact of the Premier League's controversial 'parachute payments' to relegated clubs as part of a 'State of the Game' review every five years. Its findings could influence which proposed sharing model the regulator may then impose - the Premier League's or the EFL's - if it is asked to decide how much money the top flight should redistribute to the football pyramid. \"We\u2019ve been real enthusiasts about the review, a proper independent analysis of the game's finances,\" Parry told BBC Sport. \"We think it\u2019s a seminal piece of work. \"It\u2019s never been done before\u2026 that should form the basis for the solution for whatever the revenue-sharing formula is going to be. \"You\u2019d hope that both parties would come close to it, but there\u2019s no guarantee of that\u2026 as we\u2019ve seen we\u2019re not very good at coming to deals.\" When asked if he was confident the two leagues could agree without the regulator having to enact its 'backstop power' to decide on a settlement, Parry said: \"Not really. We\u2019d love to get a deal done, but [there\u2019s] no signs to suggest it's going to be straightforward or quick.\"\n\nThe EFL has been calling for the Premier League to share 25% of its media revenues, but talks collapsed in March. Parachute payments are among the reasons the two leagues have been unable to reach a new financial settlement worth an average \u00a3125m per year extra, despite years of negotiations and pressure from politicians. The EFL believes the payments - worth tens of millions of pounds to relegated clubs - distort competition and encourage reckless spending among Championship clubs. The Premier League insists the payments are essential to give club owners the confidence to invest. After they were excluded from the previous bill, Parry is \"pleased\" that the regulator can now consider them if deemed of risk to financial sustainability. \"We\u2019re not saying they should be abolished,\" said Parry. \"They should be properly considered alongside other distributions, so the fact they are is good. Because they\u2019re a proportion of the Premier League\u2019s TV revenues, they have exploded over the last 20 years. \"They\u2019ve just got way too big and it needs a rethink. It really is about how do we make sure relegated clubs are protected, but there\u2019s fair competition within the Championship. \"We\u2019re all about sustainability and to achieve that what we really need is the position where we have sporting jeopardy without financial catastrophe.\"\n\nParry, who was the Premier League's first chief executive from 1992 to 1997, said the game needs \"fairer distribution of revenues\". He added: \"If you go to the first year of the Premier League in 1992-93, the difference in turnover [with the] EFL was \u00a311m. It\u2019s now \u00a33.3bn. That\u2019s a chasm that\u2019s not bridgeable, so we do need a reset.\" Amendments can be made to the legislation as it passes through parliament, and Parry says his \"strong preference\" is for the regulator to have the power to dictate its own financial settlement, rather than having to choose one of the proposals put forward by the leagues. Last month the Premier League expressed concern at the regulator having \"unprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of [its] revenues\" and said it could have \"a negative impact on competitiveness, clubs' investment in world-class talent and the aspiration that drives our global appeal and growth\". It is talking to government with a view to persuading it to make changes to the framework of the legislation in order to avoid what it has called \"unintended consequences\". However, Parry said fears the Premier League\u2019s competitiveness could be affected were \"nonsense\". \"In 2018-19 it was paying \u00a31.6 billion more in wages than the other major European leagues. Ten years previously it was \u00a3567m more, so the gap had grown by a billion, which is frankly extraordinary.\"\n\nParry also expressed concern at \u201ca whole raft of competition law cases which are impacting on the way that we run the game\". He continued: \"Having been left more or less free to set their own rules for many years, now the competition law authorities\u2026 seem to be saying, 'we don't think that the people running football are doing a terribly good job of it'. \"To be looking over our shoulder all of the time with challenges from clubs if they don't like rules\u2026 the game will grind to a halt unless we find a solution for that.\" In September, Leicester City won an appeal against a possible points deduction for an alleged breach of financial rules, when an independent panel found the Premier League did not have the jurisdiction to punish the club as it had been relegated to the Championship when their accounting period ended. The ruling indicated the wording in the Premier League's regulations was not legally sound. Last month two aspects of the Premier League\u2019s associated party transaction rules - which regulate commercial deals involving clubs' owners - were deemed unlawful by a tribunal after being challenged by Manchester City, which has since threatened further legal action. \"It's certainly getting a lot more difficult,\" said Parry. \"I have no problem with us having to be more professional and to be at the top of our game because that's where we should be. But it's the willingness of clubs at the drop of a hat to challenge the whole system. \"You have to question how long you can function effectively while that mentality exists, and we have to find a solution to that. \"The way in which we ensure consistency of financial regulation across the two leagues isn't working. One thing a single independent regulator will bring is that consistency.\" The legislation will \"explicitly require clubs to provide effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices, and any proposals to relocate home grounds. It will no longer be required to consider government foreign and trade policy when approving club takeovers, and there will be \"a clear commitment\" to do more to improve equality, diversity and inclusion. Nineteen amendments have been proposed by the Fair Game campaign group of 34 lower league clubs, including the scrapping of parachute payments, excluding the possibility that the owner of a club could be a state or state-controlled entity, and making the state of the game review assess player welfare, along with an examination of multi-club ownership.\n\nParry also called on the Football Association to improve the pathway for the development of homegrown coaches after the appointment of German Thomas Tuchel as England manager. \"I passionately believe that the coach of the national team should be English,\" said Parry, who sits on the FA\u2019s board. \"I think it's incumbent on us now to make sure that we have long-term solutions that we have the right pool of coaches coming through. That young English coaches are not demotivated by the thought 'we're never going to get the top job'. \"So I think in parallel with Thomas doing his utmost to win us the next trophy, it\u2019s really, really important that the FA is putting proper plans in place to make sure that we do improve the pathway. We cannot wait for 18 months and then say 'now we'll pick up the baton'. Now is the time to be to be looking at that.\"",

    "Aslef members are set to strike on different days in November\n\nLondon Underground train drivers are set to strike next month in a dispute over pay, the Aslef union has announced. As well as Tube drivers, instructors, management grade staff and those in the engineering section are to take action. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) has also announced industrial action by its members next month. Aslef said train operators and management grade staff would strike on 7 and 12 November, and those in the engineering section for 24 hours from 18:00 GMT on 1 November. Transport for London (TfL) said the action by Aslef and the RMT was \"disappointing\" but it remained engaged with the unions.\n\nFinn Brennan, Aslef\u2019s full-time organiser on London Underground, said: \"We don\u2019t want to go on strike \u2013 we don\u2019t want to make travelling in and around the capital more difficult for passengers and we don\u2019t want to lose a day\u2019s pay \u2013 but we have been forced into this position because [London Underground] management won\u2019t sit down properly and negotiate with us.\" The union said its Tube train driver members \"overwhelmingly\" backed taking industrial action, with 98.8% voting in favour on a turnout of 68%. Aslef is seeking a pay agreement with London Underground, which has offered a 3.8% pay rise and a variable lump sum. Mr Brennan said the offer would leave members on a lower salary than drivers on other TfL services, such as the Elizabeth line and Overground. Different groups of staff will also not be working any overtime at various times in November.\n\nThe RMT also announced that its members, including signalling and station staff, would walk out on different days between 1 and 8 November after rejecting a \"wholly inadequate\" pay offer. The union said some progress was made in negotiations, but maintained that the current proposal left a large number of staff excluded from collective bargaining. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"London Underground's pay offer falls short of what our members deserve. It threatens to remove collective bargaining for a growing portion of staff, pushing them into pay bands that are decided solely by management. This undermines our members' rights and the core principles of fair negotiation. \"No trade union can accept any pay proposal where management decide which of our members gets a pay rise and those who do not.\" Strikes will start on 1 November by maintenance workers and continue with different union members including signalling and station staff from 6-8 November. The RMT said about 10,000 of its members were involved in the dispute, adding that it remained ready to engage in talks - but that a \"fair and fully consolidated\" pay offer must be put forward.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \"We have held several constructive discussions with our trade unions and, after considering their feedback, have made a revised offer with an average uplift of 4.6%, which rewards our staff for their hard work and benefits the lowest-paid staff the most.\" They said talks had been conducted in \"good faith\" and further meetings would take place next week. \"Our offer is fair for our people and affordable for London, and we urge our unions to continue working with us to support London and the wider economy,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nPay talks do tend to follow this pattern, BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards writes. Commuters will hope that during the upcoming talks the dispute is resolved. Otherwise on the days Aslef train drivers go out there will be little if no service on the Tube. On the days of the RMT strikes there could be a service but it would be limited and heavily disrupted.",

    "Israeli strikes kill at least 40 in east Lebanon - health ministry\n\nPeople search through rubble following a strike in the town of al-Ain in the Baalbek region on Wednesday\n\nAt least 40 people were killed in Israeli air strikes in eastern Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The Israeli military said the strikes, in the governorates of Baalbek and Bekaa, hit operatives and infrastructure of the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Lebanon's culture minister said one of the strikes seriously damaged an Ottoman-era building in the vicinity of the Roman ruins in the city of Baalbek, which is a Unesco World Heritage site. Strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Wednesday, after the Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings. The military said it struck Hezbollah command centres, weapons stores and other infrastructure.\n\nA later military warning covered four neighbourhoods in southern Beirut including an area near Lebanon's only commercial airport, which has continued to operate during the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Soon afterwards, pictures showed a large fireball and thick black smoke rising into the night sky above Beirut. Meanwhile, a rocket fired by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon killed an Israeli man near a kibbutz in northern Israel, paramedics said.\n\nA large fireball was seen near Beirut's airport following an overnight Israeli strike\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Lebanon's Civil Defence agency said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from a four-storey apartment building that was hit by an Israeli strike the previous evening. The building in Barja, a predominantly Sunni Muslim coastal town south of Beirut that is outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds, was reportedly housing displaced people. The Israeli military said it had struck \"terror infrastructure\u201d belonging to Hezbollah. A man who lived on one of the upper floors of the apartment building said his son and wife were injured by falling masonry. \"These rocks that you see here weigh 100kg, they fell on a 13kg kid,\" Moussa Zahran told Reuters news agency as he surveyed the damage. \u201cI removed [the rocks] and... handed my son to the civil defence through the window. I carried my wife and came downstairs and got out behind the building... I thank God, glory be to Him, for this miracle.\u201d An Irish Times correspondent cited a member of the civil defence at the scene as saying that those killed whose bodies were found complete included seven women and three children, external - a seven-month-old baby and two girls aged seven and 12. Neighbours also said the building was housing displaced people who had fled from other areas, she added. There was no evacuation warning ahead of the strike, according to Reuters. The Lebanese health ministry gave a preliminary death toll of 20 from the strike on Barja late on Tuesday but did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday.\n\nMoussa Zahran said his wife and son were injured by the air strike in Barja\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the ministry said 40 people had been killed and 53 others injured in a series of Israeli strikes in Bekaa and Baalbek governorates, which make up most of the eastern Bekaa Valley. They included 16 people killed in the village of Nasriyah and 11 in Baalbek city, it added. Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada also told the director-general of Unesco that one of the strikes had \"caused serious damage to the ancient Manshiya building\" in Baalbek city, which he said dated back to the Ottoman period and was located in the vicinity of the ruins of several Roman temples. \"The destruction of this exceptional monument next to a Unesco World Heritage site is an irremediable loss for Lebanon and for world heritage,\" he warned. An AFP news agency correspondent also reported that the famous 19th Century Palmyra Hotel near the Roman ruins was damaged by nearby strikes, which the health ministry said killed two people. On Thursday morning, the Israeli military put out a statement saying it had killed approximately 60 Hezbollah fighters in strikes on about 20 \"terror targets\" in the area of Baalbek and north of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) north of the border with Israel. Dozens of other strikes targeted a rocket launcher, weapons storage facilities and other infrastructure, it added.\n\nThe military also said it had killed the commander of Hezbollah\u2019s forces in the southern border region of Khiam, and that a number of other Hezbollah fighters had been killed by air strikes and by troops operating inside southern Lebanon over the past day. Meanwhile, Hezbollah\u2019s new secretary general, Naim Qassem, said in a speech that the group had \u201ctens of thousands of trained resistance combatants\u201d ready to fight and that nowhere in Israel was \u201cbeyond the reach of our drones and missiles\u201d. \"I will tell you very clearly, our conviction is that only one thing can stop this war of aggression, and that is the battlefield,\" he declared, adding that he did not believe \"political action\" would end the conflict. The Israeli military said Hezbollah fired about 170 rockets into northern and central Israel on Wednesday. In the evening, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said a man was killed by a rocket near the kibbutz of Kfar Masaryk, which is south of the coastal town of Acre. Paramedics said the man was found in a field with severe shrapnel wounds and that he was pronounced dead at the scene. Later, Israeli media identified him as Sivan Sade, an 18-year-old resident of Kfar Masaryk who had been working in the field.\n\nA large section of a Hezbollah rocket hit a parked car in the town of Raanana, near Tel Aviv\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Israeli media said one rocket hit a car park near Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, but the Israel Airport Authority said its operations were not affected. Hezbollah said it targeted the Tzrifin military base near the airport. A large section of a rocket also hit a parked car in the town of Raanana, just north of Tel Aviv. Since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah six weeks ago, at least 2,400 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million displaced across Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities. Israeli air strikes have eliminated most of the group\u2019s leadership, including Qassem\u2019s predecessor Hassan Nasrallah, and caused widespread destruction in parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Israeli authorities say more than 70 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights over the past year.",
    "Amorim vows to restore Man Utd to where club 'belongs'\n\nManchester United's first home game under Ruben Amorim will be against Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League on 28 November\n\nManchester United's new head coach Ruben Amorim says he is confident of putting the club back where it \"belongs\". Amorim flew into Manchester on Monday after being confirmed as Erik ten Hag\u2019s replacement. The 39-year-old is the seventh man since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 to take up the challenge of trying to get United competing for major trophies again. None of them has been able to engineer a sustained Premier League title push, taken United beyond the last eight of the Champions League or completed three full seasons in the job. In his first public comments since arriving in the UK, former Sporting boss Amorim told United's club media he is determined to change that narrative. \"I will try to do everything to put this club in the place that it belongs,\" he said. \"And I believe a lot that we are going to succeed.\"\n\nUnited have posted a number social media images of Amorim meeting players, executives and some fans who were on a tour of Old Trafford when he walked into the home dressing room. He has also tried to soak in some of the club's storied past. Not just the record 20 English titles and three European Cups but also the dark days of the Munich air disaster and the rise to glory under Sir Matt Busby. While most supporters were not alive when that happened, Amorim feels it is important players understand the magnitude of the club they are playing for. \"You see the trophies and you see the tragedy that we have as a club,\" he said. \"You understand the history, after the crash, then we were European champions. It is important to put this kind of strength in the team. \"When the players come here, they should make the same tour. It is very important. You have to feel this is Manchester United.\" As the players he met earlier in the week, including England trio Kobbie Mainoo, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount, were all doing rehabilitation, it will be next week before Amorim will really get to work. Alejandro Garnacho and Manuel Ugarte have World Cup qualifying commitments in South America in the early hours of Wednesday morning UK time, so it will likely be Friday before he has his full squad together to prepare for his first game in charge, at Ipswich, on 24 November. Amorim accepts not everything will be to his satisfaction. But he is promising fans they will see a team that is inherently his. \"The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character we had in the past,\" he said. \"We will focus a lot on our game model - how to play, how to press, these small things. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. But if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, it is identity.\" Judgement around Amorim's appointment will be made against United's new structure, from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, through board member Sir Dave Brailsford, chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox. Berrada has been the driving force behind Amorim's appointment, with Ashworth and Wilcox the executives he will be working with most closely. Amorim says he feels there is a strong connection already and he can see the excitement around Ineos' wider plans for the club. \"We want to do something special in a special club - that was a key point,\u201d he said. \"When Manchester United told me about their plans, you get excited. We know if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. \"It's a real honour that I was the first choice to start that path.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

A young girl aged six or seven was among the dead, he added. People were sitting on benches under the outdoor overhang at the station in Novi Sad, Serbia's second city, at the time of the collapse around noon local time (11:00 GMT), Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) reported. Three people are in hospital. Among them are two women who were pulled alive from under the rubble a few hours after the collapse.\n\nIn an address to the nation, Mr Vu\u010di\u0107 said he hoped the number of dead would not rise beyond 14, adding that five of those killed had still not been identified. \"Those responsible, I assure you, will be punished,\" he said, quoted by AFP. Around 80 rescuers from all over the country are involved in the search, using heavy machinery, which is still ongoing. The railway station building was renovated in 2021, and renovated again this year in order to be officially opened on 5 July. Serbian media quoted Railway Infrastructure of Serbia, the body responsible for the concrete canopy, as saying it had not been reconstructed with the station. It was built in 1964. Prime Minister Milo\u0161 Vu\u010devi\u0107 said Friday was one of the most difficult days in Novi Sad's post-war history. \"This is a great, terrible tragedy for Novi Sad and for all of Serbia,\" he added, sending condolences to the families of the victims and thanking first responders.

    "Huw Edwards was given a six month suspended jail sentence at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in September\n\nA man has accused former news presenter Huw Edwards of attempting to \u201cgroom\u201d him when he was 18 and still in school. Saying he behaved inappropriately towards him, the man - now in his early 20s - said Edwards invited him to the BBC\u2019s London offices when he was a pupil. He alleged Edwards messaged him offers of help with his career, adding that he now sees them as something more. A BBC spokesperson said \"robust safeguarding policies are in place\" regarding site visits and careful consideration would be given to any concerns.\n\nThe young man, who requested anonymity, shared with Y Byd ar Bedwar - S4C\u2019s current affairs programme - a series of messages where Edwards referred to him as \u201cbabe\u201d and \u201cbig boy\u201d and signed off with kisses. He also says he was invited to the BBC\u2019s London offices by the former News at Ten presenter. Shortly after he visited the premises he said Edwards cut all contact with him. \"I think it\u2019s obvious he was grooming me, trying to pull me in,\" he said. \"I remember him asking me to meet him, then telling me not to worry if I couldn't, which he followed with a few kisses. \u201cI look at this now and think, 'He\u2019s just playing with me'.\n\n\u201cI feel angry about the way he\u2019s treated people and because others have had much worse experiences than me. After pleading guilty to making indecent images of children, 63-year-old Edwards was given a six month suspended jail sentence at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in September. He had 41 illegal images of children on his phone, including an image of a child approximately aged between seven and nine. Journalist and presenter Beti George, who has worked regularly with Edwards, said: \"Something has happened to Huw. \"I don\u2019t know what, but the Huw I know or thought I knew would never do something like that. \"Who in their right mind would do such a thing? There is no justification for it.\"\n\nEdwards, who joined the BBC in 1984, was one of the UK's most high-profile broadcasters\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"We have been clear that we are appalled by Huw Edwards\u2019 crimes. \"He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him.\" They added that a board-commissioned independent review of the BBC\u2019s workplace culture is under way, focusing on preventing abuse of power and ensuring everyone at the BBC conducts themselves in line with company values. \"The BBC has robust safeguarding policies and processes in place and if people contact us directly with concerns we will look at these carefully, in line with our complaints framework,\" they added. Y Byd ar Bedwar, external's makers made repeated attempts to contact Edwards, but he did not respond to their messages.",
    "Viktoriia Roshchyna was detained last year while reporting in Russian-occupied Ukraine\n\nViktoriia Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 in a part of Ukraine now occupied by Russian forces. It took nine months for Russian authorities to confirm the journalist had been detained. They gave no reason. This week, her father got a terse letter from the defence ministry in Moscow informing him that Viktoriia was dead, aged 27. The document said the journalist\u2019s body would be returned in one of the swaps organised by Russia and Ukraine for soldiers killed on the battlefield. The death date was given as 19 September. Again, there was no explanation.\n\nThis weekend, friends gathered to remember Viktoriia on the Maidan in central Kyiv. They shuffled into position on the steps holding her photograph, young face smiling out at the small crowd. \u201cShe had huge courage,\u201d one woman began the tributes. \u201cWe will miss her enormously,\u201d said another, turning away as her eyes filled with tears. Viktoriia\u2019s stories were snapshots of life that Ukrainians were not getting from anywhere else. Reporting from occupied areas of Ukraine was extremely dangerous, but her colleagues remember how she was desperate to go there, even after she was detained and held in custody the first time, for ten days.\n\nFormer colleagues held a vigil in Kyiv to remember Viktoriia Roshchyna\n\n\u201cHer parents used to call and tell us to stop deploying her, but we never did deploy her!\u201d one of her former bosses recalled. \u201cAll her editors tried to stop her. But it was impossible.\u201d The young reporter eventually went freelance in order to deploy herself and when she got back newspapers would buy her reports. Most strikingly, she never used a pseudonym even though she wrote openly of \"occupied\" territory and referred to those who collaborated with the Russians as \"traitors\". \u201cShe wanted to provide information about how those cities live under siege by the Russian army,\u201d Sevgil Musaieva, editor-in-chief at Ukrayinska Pravda, told the BBC.\n\nViktoriia's father has previously described how she set out via Poland and Russia last July, heading for occupied Ukraine. It was a week before she called to say she\u2019d been interrogated at the border for several days. All we know for sure after that, is that by May she was in Detention Centre No. 2 in Taganrog, southern Russia \u2013 a facility so notorious for the brutal treatment of many Ukrainians that some dub it the \"Russian Guantanamo\". According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, another Ukrainian citizen who was released from Taganrog last month has told Viktoriia\u2019s family she saw the journalist on 8 or 9 September. Then, there was cause for hope. \u201cI was 100% sure she\u2019d be back on 13 September this year. My sources gave me 100% guarantees,\u201d Musaieva, from Ukrayinska Pravda, says. She had been told Viktoriia would be included in one of the periodic prisoner-of-war swaps that Ukraine and Russia carry out, planned for the middle of last month. \u201cSo what happened with her in prison? Why didn\u2019t she come home?\u201d\n\nSevgil Musaieva says her colleague wanted to shine a light on the hardships of life in cities occupied by the Russian army\n\nViktoriia was moved, with another Ukrainian woman, but neither were included in the prisoner exchange. \u201cThat means she was taken somewhere else,\" says Media Initiative director Tetyana Katrychenko. \"They say to Lefortovo. Why there? We don\u2019t know.\" She says it\u2019s not normal practice ahead of a swap. Lefortovo prison in Moscow is run by the FSB security service and used for those accused of espionage and serious crimes against the state. \u201cMaybe they took her there to start some kind of court proceeding or investigation. That\u2019s happened to other civilians taken from Kherson and Melitopol,\u201d Tetyana says. The BBC understands that Viktoriia\u2019s father had spoken to her in prison on 30 August. At some point, she had called a hunger strike, but that day her father urged her to start eating again and she agreed. \u201cThat needs investigating. It also means we\u2019d be blaming her, partially, and not the Russian Federation, as we should,\u201d Tetyana cautions. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service has confirmed Viktoriia\u2019s death and the General Prosecutor\u2019s office has changed its criminal case from illegal detention to murder. In Russia, Viktoriia was never charged with any crime and the circumstances of her detention are not known. \u201cA civilian journalist \u2026 captured by Russia. Then Russia sends a letter that she died?\u201d Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn told the BBC in Kyiv. \u201cIt's killing. Just the killing of hostages. I don't know other word.\u201d\n\nSince the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, huge numbers of civilians have been taken from areas of Ukraine that Moscow has overrun and now controls. Like Viktoriia\u2019s family, desperate relatives are left with little or no information on their whereabouts or wellbeing, and no idea whether they\u2019ll ever get home. So far, the Media Initiative has collated a list of 1,886 names. \"There\u2019s all sorts of people, including ex-soldiers and police officers and local officials like mayors,\u201d Tetyana says. \u201cAnd of course there may be many more we don\u2019t know about.\u201d Neither lawyers nor the Red Cross get access and even if someone\u2019s location can be confirmed, getting them back home is almost impossible: civilians are rarely swapped.\n\nRoshchyna's colleague Nataliya Humenyuk said in a tribute on social media that she left behind a great legacy\n\nViktoriia\u2019s friends and colleagues say they won\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve investigated what happened. \u201cHer life was her work,\u201d Angelina Karyakina, a former editor at Hromadske says. \u201cIt's a rare type of people who are so determined.\u201d \u201cI'm pretty sure the way she would want us to remember her is not to stand here and cry, but to remember her dignity,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think what\u2019s important for us journalists, is to find out what she was working on \u2013 and to finish her story.\u201d",

    "New deals with Balkan states to target people smugglers\n\nThe UK has signed new agreements with western Balkan countries to tackle people-smuggling gangs, as part of efforts to bring down small boat crossings. The deals will increase intelligence sharing and cooperation with Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo to intercept and arrest the gangs, with the aim of breaking their business models at source. The government said the region was a key route used by those who end up in the European Union or UK illegally, with almost 100,000 migrants transiting through the western Balkans last year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the plans at a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) in Hungarian capital Budapest on Thursday.\n\nMore than 31,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year - more than the same period last year. The UK already has agreements with countries including Albania and Turkey to share intelligence to disrupt people-smuggling gangs. Sir Keir said: \"There is a criminal empire operating on our continent, exacting a horrendous human toll and undermining our national security.\" He said the UK would be \"at the heart of the efforts to end the scourge of organised immigration crime\" but \"we cannot do it in isolation\". He added: \"We need to go further and faster, alongside our international partners, and take the fight directly to the heart of these vile people smuggling networks.\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Working more closely with Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo, we will share information and intelligence, and work across borders to map out what is happening and where, to break the business models of these unscrupulous gangs at source.\"\n\nIt comes after the government announced an extra \u00a375m funding for the UK's new Border Security Command, which brings together police, intelligence and immigration enforcement agencies to tackle small boat crossings. Graeme Biggar, the National Crime Agency's (NCA) director general, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that continuing to work with international partners was \"crucial\". He added that it is \"very difficult to have exact confidence\" on how much measures would reduce the number of UK small boat crossings as \"so much depends on what's happening with the rest of the world\". On tackling people-smuggling gangs, Mr Biggar said that what is \"particularly hard\" for the NCA \"is that the people themselves are not illegal, their presence in the UK or in some countries on the way here may be illegal, and often the tools that they are using to get here are not themselves illegal - boats and engines\". \"So being able to prove a criminal conspiracy is quite hard,\" he added. The EPC was set up in 2022 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a way of bringing together European heads of government for informal talks and improving cooperation. The group includes the 27 members of the EU as well as 20 other European countries.",
    "Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have agreed the relationship between the UK and US is \"incredibly strong\" and will \"continue to thrive\", Downing Street has said. In the first phone call between the pair after the US election, the PM offered his \"hearty congratulations\" to Trump after his \"historic victory\" and said he looked forward to working closely with the President-elect, a No 10 spokeswoman said. It comes after Kemi Badenoch urged Sir Keir to apologise for \"derogatory\" comments made about Trump by David Lammy before he was foreign secretary. In her first appearance in Parliament as Conservative leader, she pressed Sir Keir on how Trump's election would affect UK policies on trade and defence.\n\nBadenoch asked the prime minister if he would push for Trump to get an invitation to address Parliament, but did not receive a direct reply. In their phone call, Downing Street said the pair also discussed the situation in the Middle East and the PM \"underscored the importance of regional stability\". \"The leaders fondly recalled their meeting in September, and President-elect Trump\u2019s close connections and affinity to the United Kingdom and looked forward to working with one another,\" a spokeswoman added. Sir Keir and his foreign secretary held a dinner with Trump in New York in September, when the pair met for the first time.\n\nIn opposition, Lammy labelled Trump a \"neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath\" but since getting into government has sought to build bridges with the president-elect and his team. Earlier, the PM's spokeswoman was pressed on whether Lammy would keep his job for the entire Parliament in light of his past comments, and replied: \"Yes, he is the foreign secretary.\"\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch said the US was the UK's single biggest trade partner and warned the prime minister he would need to \"look after the special relationship\". She said there was now a \"risk of increased tariffs on UK exports\" and asked if he would revisit talks on establishing a free trade agreement with the US. Since leaving the European Union, UK ministers have been keen to reach a trade deal with the US - however, there has been little progress. During his election campaign, Trump pledged to dramatically increase tariffs on foreign exports. Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: \"Of course we will discuss issues of our economy with the president-elect, as we already have done.\" Later, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told MPs on the cross-party Treasury Select Committee the UK's trading relationship with the US was \"crucial\", but she was \"confident those trade flows will continue under President Trump\". She added: \"[He's] been President before, we continue to have a good and strong economic relationship... I\u2019m optimistic about our ability to shape the global economic agenda.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: PM and Badenoch congratulate Trump on US election victory\n\nOn defence, Badenoch echoed calls from Trump that European countries should increase their defence spending and urged the prime minister to match her party's commitment to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030. Sir Keir reiterated his government's commitment to the 2.5% target - although it has not set a deadline for meeting the goal. He added that, unlike the previous Labour government, the Conservatives had failed to meet the target while in office. He also attacked the Conservatives for leaving a \u00a317bn black hole in the Ministry of Defence's finances.\n\nLabour accused Badenoch of misleading Parliament when she incorrectly told MPs that the \u201cchancellor's Budget did not even mention defence\u201d. Badenoch's spokesman insisted she had not got it wrong because it was \"obvious\" from the context of what she had said in her previous question that \u201cshe was referring to the fact that there was no reference to how Labour intend to get to that 2.5%\u201d. In her Budget speech last week, the chancellor said \u201cwe will set a path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence at a future fiscal event.\u201d\n\nScottish First Minister John Swinney said Scotland and the US \"share many social, cultural and economic links\". \"In that relationship, we will stand fast in support of our values of fairness, democracy and equality \u2013 ideals that America was built upon.\" Badenoch said: \"The world faces many serious challenges and I look forward to our two countries working together to confront them.\" Nigel Farage, Reform UK leader and a friend of Trump, said the president-elect was a \"genuine friend of the United Kingdom\" and urged the prime minister to \"roll out the red carpet\" for him. \"This is a huge opportunity to be grasped.\"\n\nOther UK party leaders have been more critical. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called the election result, external \"a dark, dark day for people around the globe\". \"The world\u2019s largest economy and most powerful military will be led by a dangerous, destructive demagogue. \"Fixing the UK\u2019s broken relationship with the EU is even more urgent than before - we must strengthen trade and defence cooperation across Europe to help protect ourselves from the damage Trump will do.\" \"On this dark day, we stand in solidarity with all US citizens who fear a convicted criminal and a fascist in the White House.\" And Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has repeatedly clashed with Trump, said many Londoners would feel \"anxious\" and \"fearful\" about what the outcome of the election would mean for democracy, women's rights, the Middle East, Ukraine or tackling the climate crisis.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Ramez Abu Nasr managed to save his brother from the rubble\n\nWarning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and violence The hand was covered in dust, streaked with blood on the fingers and wrist, all that could be seen of the person who was killed. Like many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north. A teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive. But then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers. They leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men. In the narrow streets men dug with their hands. But there were no sounds coming from the rubble now. Whoever lay there was beyond help.\n\nThe Abu Nasr family were entombed by falling masonry after Israeli air strikes\n\nRamez Abu Nasr was digging for hours. His mother, father and brothers were entombed by the falling masonry. Ramez managed to save his youngest brother. The boy told him that he had heard his parents nearby, reciting the Shehada, the Muslim prayer of faith. Soon after they were silent. \u201cI took out my younger brother at the last moment. I don\u2019t know how we can go back to our home... without my mother, or father, or brothers,\u201d says Ramez. The family fled here from Jabalia when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began their renewed offensive against Hamas in the north twelve days ago. The IDF issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many thousands stayed behind, exhausted by constant displacement, fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies.\n\nInside a house that is still standing, a young man kneels in front of his dead sister. She looks to be in her thirties. \u201cOh God, my sister, my sister,\u201d he calls out. Civil Defence volunteers are gathering bodies from inside buildings. They find a badly wounded man and race to the ambulance. They are trying to save a life, but also are afraid of being bombed themselves. Ahmed al Kahlout from the local Civil Defence looked around him at the carnage. Behind him, a colleague tries to give CPR to a woman. It is hopeless. \"This is the al-Sayyed family house,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cThere are bodies, torn parts in this area... It is a horrible crime.\u201d Several ambulances are lined up in the streets. Most of those inside them are dead. Bodies are piled up. All ages. Blood seeps from the forehead of a small child. A woman, wrapped in a brightly coloured blanket is loaded beside her. Next to the ambulance a dead man, middle aged, is lying on a hospital trolley.\n\nMany of the casualties are taken to Jabalia\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital. It's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiyyah, told me by phone that his hospital faced a dire humanitarian crisis and accused Israel of imposing collective punishment. \"We urge the world to intervene and impose their humanity over the Israeli army, to open humanitarian corridors that allow the entrance of medical tools, delegations, fuel, and food so that we can provide humanitarian services for the children, newborn babies, and patients who are in need,\u201d he said. The United States has accused Israel of refusing or impeding up to 90% of aid to northern Gaza in the last month - and threatened to cut arms shipments unless there is change. Israel says it is taking American concerns seriously and is \u201caddressing the issue\". International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel. The IDF says it only targets \u201cterror cells\u201d and released a video of what it said was Hamas firing from within a clinic in Jabalia. The army also said they\u2019d found weapons and boobytraps in a medical facility. In the video an officer, his face blurred, points to booby traps and weapons and speaks to the camera: \u201cEverything here is a cynical exploitation of the civilian population, inside a clinic, inside a civilian compound. We will pursue these terrorists and find them in every corner.\u201d In Jabalia, a heavily pregnant woman is sitting in the dust outside a house.

    "Alex Salmond led his party from the political fringe to power at Holyrood\n\nAlex Salmond was a man and a politician of extreme contradictions. A one-time radical firebrand, he moved his party from the political margins and perpetual opposition to government and the mainstream of Scottish public life. He was a gambler and divider of opinions who became a rock-steady first minister with a mission to show voters that he could govern for all, using devolution to prove independence was nothing to be frightened of. And he was a powerful communicator who would see his reputation diminished amid allegations of sexual misconduct, a criminal trial and exile from the SNP. His death at the age of 69 brings to an end a remarkable life and political career and an important chapter in the story of the independence movement. Salmond's reputation as a political heavyweight ensured he was a high-profile politician across the UK long before he won Holyrood's top job. In a BBC Scotland profile in 2011, former Conservative cabinet member Michael Portillo described him as the only Scottish politician to become well known in England and internationally while spending most of his career in Scottish politics. \"I regard him as the outstanding politician not to have come out of Scotland, but to have remained in Scotland,\" he said.\n\nSalmond was born and raised in Linlithgow, West Lothian\n\nBorn on Hogmanay 1954 in Linlithgow, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond grew up in a town soaked in Scottish history and tradition. A talented boy soprano, he sang in St Michael's Parish Church. The 15th Century kirk, which stands next to Linlithgow Palace, was a place of royal worship and the site of Mary Queen of Scots' baptism. Salmond described his parents as working class nationalists with a small \u2018n\u2019. He was proud to have grown up in a council house, educated in Scotland's distinctly egalitarian school system built on the Kirk's traditions. From there he made his way to the University of St Andrews, where he studied economics and medieval history and joined the SNP almost immediately after arriving there in 1973. The party was just about to take off, achieving 30% of the vote and sending 11 MPs to Westminster in the election of October 1974. A contemporary at St Andrews, future BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor, later remembered him as a \"mischief maker\" at St Andrews. \"If he had two options to make a political point, he would always use the one which allowed him to make mischief as well as making the point,\" he said. \"But he was also a brilliantly focussed politician. He was president of the Federation of Nationalist Students, and he was very focussed. He was easily the same quality as his political contemporaries such as Gordon Brown down in Edinburgh.\" After university, the radical young political activist who wanted to bring about the end of the United Kingdom state then embarked on a career right at the heart of it. In 1978, he entered the Government Economic Service (GES) as an assistant economist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, part of the now defunct Scottish Office. After two years later he moved to the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked for seven years as an economist, eventually coming to specialise in oil and gas.\n\nAlex Salmond was first elected to Westminster in 1987\n\nBut all the while the world of politics was exerting its pull. An active member of the SNP, he played a prominent role in the party's dissident 79 Group. They wanted to move the SNP to the left, seeking the support of working-class and disaffected Labour voters who were unhappy at the failure of their party to deliver the promised Scottish Assembly. The group was expelled from the party in 1982 but his colleagues saw Salmond as too talented to be left out in the cold and brought the trouble-makers back into the ranks. By the late 1980s, as Thatcherism swept across Scotland and the country felt the full force of her economic policies on its industrial sector, Salmond was seen as a rising star and potential future leader. Elected as MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987, he quickly made his mark by getting himself banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the chancellor's Budget speech in protest at the introduction of the community charge in Scotland. When the job of party leader came up in 1990, Salmond made his move and won, perhaps surprisingly repositioning the SNP as more centrist, socially democratic and pro-European.\n\nAlex Salmond led his party - and close colleagues John Swinney, Nicola Sturgeon and Michael Russell - into the Scottish Parliament in 1999\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Salmond became a familiar figure on radio and television and a great favourite of the UK press. An effective political analyst and communicator, he derided the Thatcher and Major governments before turning his criticism on New Labour and Tony Blair. He also increased his command of the SNP. His grip over its senior members and processes was total. He built close support from key comrades such as party chief executive Michael Russell and younger talents including Nicola Sturgeon, who would become his protege and eventual deputy. Salmond led the party into joining the \"Yes-Yes\" campaign for a Scottish parliament, arguing the \"gradualist\" rather than \"fundamentalist\" approach to gaining independence. The SNP came second at the inaugural Holyrood election in 1999 and Salmond appeared to enjoy the role of chief opposition leader. A witty and brilliant debater, he did not always show the best judgement. As Nato planes bombed Serbia in retaliation for its attacks on Kosovo, he opposed the conflict because it was not authorised by a United Nations Security Council resolution. Salmond described the Nato action as \"an act of dubious legality, but, above all, one of unpardonable folly\" and was heavily criticised for his comments.\n\nSalmond was the lead MP calling for the impeachment of Tony Blair over the war in Iraq\n\nIn 2000, Salmond made the surprise decision to quit and stand down as both leader and MSP. He returned to Westminster, a move which underlined a common criticism that the man calling for Scotland's \"freedom\" was more at home in London. But he was also in demand as an acute critic of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the close personal and political relationship between UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush. Salmond was one of 11 MPs who attempted unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Blair. His actions, as well as his presence on marches and speeches at protests, made him a leading figure in the anti-war movement and won him many admirers. But his absence from Edinburgh during this period was not good for his party. John Swinney had succeeded him as leader, but stood down in 2004 following a string of dismal election results, criticism from across his party and the negative publicity of a leadership challenge. As that summer progressed, there were persistent rumours that Salmond was considering a return. He responded by borrowing a line from General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: \"If nominated, I'll decline. If drafted, I'll defer. And if elected, I'll resign.\" Always partial to a dramatic flourish, Salmond announced he had changed his mind just before nominations closed, having cut a deal with candidate Nicola Sturgeon which saw her agree to be his number two. He told journalists he was not just launching a campaign to be SNP leader, but his \"candidacy to be first minister of Scotland\". He promised to unite what had become a fractious Scottish parliamentary party, and focus on winning the 2007 election. And that he did, by the narrowest of margins. He formed a minority government and relied on Green and Conservative support to get his manifesto through one vote at a time. For the more radical elements of his party, this might have been seen as sleeping with the enemy. But Salmond recognised working across the chamber was both necessary and desirable.\n\nThe one-time republican enjoyed both the trappings of the office and a good relationship with the Queen\n\nHe was comfortable in the role of first minister and went about government in a measured, positive way. There was less of the smart-Alex of old and it was clear he took the job seriously. Salmond had been in the role for just over a month when Islamist terrorists rammed the front entrance of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport. His handling of the crisis was met with acclaim and he worked closely with Gordon Brown's government in London. But over the coming few years there would be clashes over the decision to release the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, and the handling of the financial crisis. Salmond was accused of taking a \"cavalier\" approach to dealing with US tycoon Donald Trump's \u00a31bn Scottish golf resort. An inquiry into the affair by Holyrood's local government committee raised concerns over the Scottish government's decision to call in the plans, following their rejection by Aberdeenshire Council, after \"two five-minute phone calls\". The probe concluded the decision, although unprecedented, was competent. It was a typical Salmond approach to problem-solving.\n\nSalmond was considered as having out-foxed Prime Minister David Cameron when negotiating the Edinburgh Agreement on the independence referendum\n\nIn many ways, 2011 marked the high point of Salmond's political career. He pulled off what had always been descibed as the impossible - winning a majority at a Scottish parliamentary election. Over the course of the following three years, Salmond was credited with out-smarting Prime Minister David Cameron and his coalition government colleagues, winning crucial battles over the timing and structure of the vote and the wording of the question which would be put to voters. The official campaign was meant to take place in the autumn of 2014 but in reality the battle lasted the three-and-a-half years between election and referendum. Rival campaigns were meant to take the debate out of the politicians' hands but in the end it came down to Salmond trading blows with Labour's Alastair Darling in a series of televised debates.\n\nSalmond was a natural campaigner and the focus of enormous attention in the run up to the referendum\n\nThe FM was strong on rhetoric and vision, projecting an optimistic view of a future Scotland that could do anything it wanted; prosperous and fair, unshackled from the union with England but close to its European allies. He was less sure on dealing with Scotland's structural deficit, what currency would be used and how state pensions would be funded and paid. In the end, the result was a \"No\" to independence. Salmond had failed. That he had led his side to a 45% share was a remarkable achievement that provided little succour. Within hours, he announced his resignation. Almost 60, it was time to hand over the fight to a younger generation. His close friend and loyal deputy Nicola Sturgeon was his chosen successor. He chose to stand again for Westminster, winning Gordon as part of the SNP surge of 2015, when the party won 56 out 59 seats, significantly enhancing its power in the Commons. But it was short-lived. He lost the seat just two years later, bringing to an end a political career spread more than 30 years and two parliaments.\n\nSalmond brought his Unleashed show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017\n\nThe following years were sometimes awkward for his supporters and admirers. His decision to host a chat show on RT, the former Russia Today channel editorially controlled by Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, was a source of criticism and embarrassment to his party. That was suspended in February 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A year later a programme with the same format began broadcasting on Turkish public television. There was an Edinburgh Fringe chat show in 2017 which included a rather crude innuendo about Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and Melania Trump. It prompted his successor as leader, Nicola Sturgeon, to comment that: \u201cOccasionally Alex is not as funny as he thinks he is.\" It was a minor hint at tension between the two and the joke would look even more unfortunate in the light of what was to come later.\n\nIn August 2018 the Daily Record newspaper revealed Salmond had been reported to police over sexual assault allegations dating back to his time as first minister. He denied the claims and said he was taking the Scottish government to court to challenge the complaints procedure which had been activated against him. A week later he resigned from the SNP after 45 years. He said he wanted to avoid internal division within the party, which was facing calls to suspend him. The subsequent parliamentary inquiry revealed that, in the nine or so months leading up to the initial story breaking, a complicated series of meetings and conversations had taken place between those at the top of the SNP and those at the top of the Scottish government, often confusing the division between the two. Mistakes in the complaints process were such that in January 2019 Salmond won a judicial review, ruling the investigation was unlawful, unfair and \"tainted by apparent bias\". He was later awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in costs.\n\nSalmond left court after his trial an innocent man but with his reputation damaged\n\nThat same month he appeared in court and was charged with 14 offences, including two counts of attempted rape. In 2020, after two weeks of evidence, he was acquitted of every charge. But the testimony was devastating for his public image. Salmond's advocate, Gordon Jackson KC, admitted that his client had sometimes behaved badly, calling him \"touchy-feely\". Details of inappropriate behaviour included Salmond admitting having a \"sleepy cuddle\" with one complainer, and what Mr Jackson called \"a bit of how's your father\" with another - both younger members of his staff, neither of them his wife. The KC said in his closing speech that the former first minister \"could certainly have been a better man\". There was also confirmation of what had long been whispered; that Salmond could bully colleagues and staff. Witnesses called him \"extraordinarily pugnacious\" and \"extremely demanding\". Two subsequent inquiries into the conduct of ministers and officials saw Salmond asserting his belief that many in his former party had colluded against him in an effort to block any final return to frontline politics.\n\nSalmond's final political project - the Alba Party - was not electorally successful\n\nYet there was to be a final return, as leader of the newly-formed Alba party. Launched just ahead of the 2021 Holyrood election, it attracted a few defections from his old party but never achieved more than 3% at the ballot box. Salmond never wavered from his belief that independence was necessary, desirable and inevitable for Scotland. His enthusiasm for the cause did not extend to his former comrades in the campaign, however. He was often brutally critical of Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney, his one time proteges and friends who succeeded him into Bute House. Away from politics, Salmond was something of an enigma. He and wife Moira, who never had children, closely protected their private lives. He loved golf, football and horse racing and was said to be a keen reader. Love him or loathe him, few would dispute Alex Salmond's skill and achievements as a politician. He never achieved his dream of independence but as one of the most talented politicians of his generation, he took the SNP as close to its goal as it had ever been.",
    "Holly says positive relationships for disabled people need better representation\n\nHolly was just 16 when someone asked her if she could have sex because she was disabled. She has been asked many other questions over the years, such as if she \"can have rough sex\" or if it needs to be in a wheelchair. \"People think they're doing you a favour, almost like a sacrifice.

Will your joints dislocate? If I wanted to have rough sex with you, would I be able to?\" Holly said people have also messaged her on social media about sex, an offer she was often made to feel she should be \"lucky\" for. Holly would like to see better positive representation in the media, citing that the character Isaac Goodwin in the programme Sex Education was the only good example she has been aware of recently.\n\nHolly married James in September and says he has always supported her with her health\n\nNicola Thomas, 38, from Caerphilly, who is registered blind, said: \"One of the more common things people will ask is, how do you have sex? It kind of takes your breath back, it's such an invasive and personal question.\" Nicola has an auto immune disease - neuromyelitis optica , external- and she lost her sight in one eye 15 years ago and the other five years ago. \"A lot of people see barriers with blindness and I'm definitely one to break those down.\" Nicola's hobbies include sailing, paddleboarding and travelling, and her next trip is to Hong Kong.\n\nNicola and her boyfriend Paul love traveling the world together\n\nNicola had a boyfriend when she lost her sight but the relationship broke down. \"I was treated like a burden, people would say you can't be a carer for her, but I didn't need a carer.\" She now has a boyfriend who is also visually impaired. \"Even though we're both blind, we'll navigate our way round a city, or go on a date on our own. Nothing holds us back.\" Nicola also said she feels stereotyped when people show an interest in her. \"People message on social media asking for dates, their attention shifts or acts differently when I tell them I'm blind.\" \"You're definitely treated like they're doing you a favour. It puts you off instantly.\" Nicola added: \"People do pigeon hole us. I want to breakdown that stereotype, I have a full and happy life.\"\n\n\"When you're disabled you're well acquainted with poverty but it's more than a monetary value, a healthy relationship is definitely a poverty.\"\n\nKat Watkins said disabled people have a right to explore their sexual identity and develop relationships just like anybody else. She is the access to politics project officer for Disability Wales. \"Why are sex and relationships such a taboo for disabled people? There is much more to us than just being able to eat and having a roof over our heads.\" \"Living your life and enjoying yourself that's just part of life, and it doesn't get highlighted enough for people with disabilities.\" Kat said hearing examples of how people message disabled women was \"sadly normalised.\" She said adaptable sex toys and aids can help give people confidence and would like to see them on more mainstream sex sites and outlets. \"You've got to be comfortable with yourself and understand your body, so you can tell others how it works.

    "Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak\n\nIsrael\u2019s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors. They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel\u2019s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States. In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran\u2019s Islamic regime.\n\nIran\u2019s official media in the hours before and after Israel\u2019s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel\u2019s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back. That is the hope of Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America\u2019s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence. \"I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,\u201d he said. \"I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond.\" Iran\u2019s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey\u2019s NTV network that \"any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.\u201d Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: \"Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force.\" It was, he said, \"highly misleading and baseless\" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack. As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran\u2019s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence \"as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter\". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.\n\nIsrael has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel. That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies. The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called \"axis of resistance\" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes. Six months into the war, Israel\u2019s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action. When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran\u2019s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices. Israel interpreted Iran\u2019s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden\u2019s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel. On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran\u2019s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden\u2019s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel\u2019s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan. Biden apparently asked Israel to \"take the win\" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden\u2019s plan seemed to be working.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel\n\nBut since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran\u2019s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon. But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah\u2019s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel\u2019s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor. Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza\u2019s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. It\u2019s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome air defence system intercepted most of Iran's missile attack on 1 October\n\nIt is hard to stop successive rounds of strikes and counter strikes when the countries concerned believe they will be seen as weak, and deterred, if they don\u2019t respond. That is how wars spin out of control. The question now is whether Iran is prepared to give Israel the last word, at least on this stage of the war. President Biden backed Israel\u2019s decision to retaliate after 1 October. But once again he tried to head off an even deadlier escalation, telling Israel publicly not to bomb Iran\u2019s most important assets, its nuclear, oil and gas installations. He augmented Israel\u2019s defences by deploying the THAAD anti-missile system to Israel, and prime minister Netanyahu agreed to take his advice. The American elections on 5 November are part of both Israel and Iran\u2019s calculations about what happens next. If Donald Trump gets his second term, he might be less concerned than Biden about answering Iranian retaliation, if it happens, with strikes on nuclear, oil and gas facilities. Once again, the Middle East is waiting. Israel\u2019s decision not to hit Iran\u2019s most valuable assets might, perhaps, give Tehran the chance to postpone a response, at least long enough for diplomats to do their work. At the UN General Assembly last month, the Iranians were suggesting that they were open to a new round of nuclear negotiations. All this should matter greatly to the world outside the Middle East. Iran has always denied it wants a nuclear bomb. But its nuclear expertise and enrichment of uranium have put a weapon within its reach. Its leaders must be looking for a new way to deter their enemies. Developing a nuclear warhead for their ballistic missiles might be on their agenda.",
    "For Shakhtar Donetsk, the stark realities of war in Ukraine are never far away.\n\nTwo days before they were due to play Kryvbas in September, the hotel they were set to be staying in was hit by a Russian missile.\n\nLocal media reported, external four people were killed and more injured in the attack in Kryvyi Rih, just over 40 miles from the nearest Russian-occupied territory and a regular target of air strikes.\n\n\"Can you imagine this, our team staying in this hotel and what can happen?\" Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"It is difficult to manage a team and difficult to attract new players in this kind of situation.

    "The operator of Pizza Hut's restaurants in the UK is looking to raise more than \u00a310m to help it cope with increased costs after tax rises on business were announced in last month's Budget. The money could come from a sale of part of the business, or new investment from existing shareholders. It comes amid growing backlash from business owners who warn, external rises in employers' national insurance contributions and the National Living Wage will push up costs for business which employ lots of low-wage workers. Heart With Smart (HWS) - which operates all 140 UK dine-in Pizza Hut restaurants - will use the money on new technology including touch-screen ordering kiosks and contactless table ordering.\n\nThe new features would allow restaurants to save money by operating with fewer staff and are already being trialled successfully in some Pizza Hut outlets, a company insider told the BBC. They said it would result in reduced staff levels, but the store does not expect a major redundancy programme. From April 2025 the rate of employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, which are paid by businesses on top of workers\u2019 salaries, will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the level where contributions start will fall to \u00a35,000. Combined with a 6.7% increase in the National Living Wage and an even bigger rise for 18 to 20-year-olds, HWS expects to see its labour costs rise \u00a34m, or about 14%, next year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously said businesses \"will have to absorb\" some of these costs through their profits.\n\nIn a letter with over 200 signatories, hospitality bosses last week, external told the chancellor the industry was disproportionately impacted by the \"unsustainable\" tax hike. They warned this would \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses. A number of businesses, including Sainsbury's, M&S, BT, Wetherspoons, Fullers and JD Sports have also hinted or warned that they may have to pass some of those extra costs on to customers by increasing prices. But HWS feels it has limited ability to do this as customers may not accept higher prices, the insider told the BBC. They said that the decision to raise the extra money is not just the result of Budget measures introduced last month. It is the effect of the changes on top of five difficult years for the restaurant business, following the pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis and labour costs which are already rising. The advisory firm Interpath has been hired to run the fundraising process, which was first reported by Sky News. Interpath has declined to comment. Asked about the impact of its tax rises on businesses, a government spokesperson said it \"had to make difficult choices... to restore desperately needed economic stability\".",
    "Mr Loverman stars Lennie James (right) as a man who has had a decades-long secret romance with a male friend\n\nAs BBC drama Mr Loverman airs, one activist remembers life as a gay, black man in the UK - and discusses how much has changed. In 1972, activist Theodore \"Ted\" Brown helped organise the UK's first Gay Pride in central London, which saw thousands march and gather for a mass kiss-in. Brown remembers being one of the few black people in attendance. In his view, Britain was \"more concerned with racism than homophobia\" at the time - but he remembers realising that the language of racism and homophobia were similar. Brown went on to co-found Black Lesbians and Gays Against Media Homophobia, an organisation fighting for the equality of British LGBT people - and has been campaigning for nearly 50 years. Brown came out as gay to his friends and family when he was 15 in 1965, two years before homosexuality was partially decriminalised in England and Wales. BBC drama Mr Loverman, based on the novel by Bernardine Evaristo, looks at life for black, gay men in the UK - like Brown - via the fictional Barrington Jedidiah Walker (played by Line of Duty star Lennie James). Walker is a seventy-four-year-old, Antiguan-born, exuberant Hackney personality, renowned for his dapper taste and fondness for retro suits - who has been having a secret, passionate affair with his best friend and soulmate, Morris (played by Ariyon Bakare). One critic, external called the series \"magnificent TV that will tear your heart open\".\n\nTed Brown (left) was part of the Gay Liberation movement in the 1970s alongside figures like Peter Tatchell (right)\n\nBoth characters are first-generation Windrush men, and the pair try to come out to Carmel, Walker's religious wife. The series explores the complexities of love and homosexuality in the black British community, and the wider impact of coming out as an older man leading a double life. Early in the series, for example, Walker hears his wife's friends from church refer to homosexuality as a \"disease\" and an \"abomination\". Later in the series, we see Walker being beaten up by a gang of white youths. Marc Thompson, an activist who was a consultant on Mr Loverman, says this serves to show that \"black communities are no more or less homophobic\" than others.\n\nMr Loverman explores the lives of multiple generations of black British LGBT people\n\nIn Walker's native Antigua, there were previously laws criminalising same-sex acts that had their roots in British colonial-era legislation forbidding \"buggery\" and \"indecency\". Lady Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, a human rights activist and CEO of UK Black Pride, argues that \"one of the many lasting legacies of the British Empire is the cultural impact of homophobia\".\n\nIn his decades of campaigning, Brown says he experienced physical violence \"a handful of times\". According to recent Home Office data, hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation have fallen for the second year in a row, to 22,839 reported incidents in England and Wales. But, in Brown's view: \"For young black men, the world can sometimes feel isolating.\" In earlier decades, public figures were sometimes subjected to abuse, like gay footballer Justin Fashanu, who is referenced in Mr Loverman. Nowadays, Brown says there have been changes in how black, gay men are perceived - and he instead sees a \"sense of pride and positive role models\". He adds: \"Today, TV, organisations, music, magazines, and websites allow black LGBTQ+ people to see themselves and connect, creating community.\" Indeed, there are now high-profile black LGBT figures including British Vogue cover star Munroe Bergdorf, number one Head & Heart singer-songwriter MNEK and Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes. According to Thompson, Mr Loverman \"tries to provide different perspectives about being black and LGBTQ+ across the decades\". He adds: \"Mr Loverman is a powerful reminder that black LGBTQ+ people have always been here and been part of our communities.\"",
    "New Zealand into semis after Pakistan all out for 56\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. New Zealand into T20 World Cup semis after Pakistan all out for 56\n\nNew Zealand booked their place in the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup with a comprehensive 54-run win over Pakistan in Dubai. Pakistan needed to chase their target of 111 within 10.4 overs to keep themselves in knockout contention via net run-rate, but paid the price for their aggressive intent by slumping to 56 all out in 11.4 overs. Despite collapsing to 28-5 after the six-over powerplay, the Pakistan batters kept attacking to keep their hopes alive rather than simply settle for a comfortable chase of less than a run-a-ball. New Zealand's batters had earlier struggled against Pakistan's spin attack, who expertly stifled the run-rate in the middle overs but were let down in the field with eight catches put down. Suzie Bates was dropped twice in her 28, the innings' top score, and then crucially three were put down in the final over which allowed Maddy Green and Izzy Gaze to scamper nine extra runs. But while their 110-6 felt below-par, New Zealand were rewarded for a disciplined all-round bowling effort with some assistance from Pakistan's chaotic but understandable approach. Leg-spinner Melie Kerr starred with 3-14 while fellow spinner Eden Carson took 2-7. It is New Zealand's first semi-final in either white-ball format since 2016, and they join six-time winners Australia from Group A with India eliminated. They will face the winner of Group B which will be either South Africa, England or West Indies, with the latter two teams playing on Tuesday.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFew would have had New Zealand as semi-final contenders before the tournament began as they came in with 10 straight T20 defeats, but started in sensational style by thumping potential winners India in their opener. And despite a heavy defeat by relentless Australia, they have continued to dominate against Sri Lanka and Pakistan to finish the group stage with plenty of momentum. The pre-match equation was simple, with a win of any margin enough, but there appeared to be some early nerves in the batting line-up given the pressure of the situation. Pakistan will rue the dropped catches - it was a pitiful display which saw bonus chances given to Bates, Kerr, Sophie Devine and Brooke Halliday. None of them capitalised enough to really rub salt into the wound, but just enough to ensure that Pakistan had to go hard early in their chase and maintain it, which proved way beyond their capabilities. Opener Muneeba Ali struck two early boundaries in her 15 before she was bowled by Lea Tahuhu, who also brilliantly ran out number three Iram Javed from short third. The powerful Aliya Riaz was promoted to open but the experiment did not pay off as she fell for a duck, as did Sidra Ameen, while captain Fatima Sana's 21 from 23 balls was the only contribution of note as the middle to lower order was skittled by the wily spin of Kerr and Carson. And while there were wild screams of delight and hugs of joy between the New Zealand players at the end, there will be a thorough examination for India, who would have been watching anxiously, but ultimately in despair. They launched a huge franchise tournament, the Women's Premier League, in early 2023 to catch up with Australia and while it has seen the emergence of some young talent including spinner Shreyanka Patil and seamer Arundhati Reddy, this is a disappointing tournament from the 2020 finalists. They thrashed Sri Lanka and Pakistan, fought admirably against Australia but it was the opening defeat by New Zealand that left them with an uphill climb, one which proved too steep.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'Poor' drop from Pakistan's Nashra Sandhu as New Zealand's Suzie Bates survives\n\nNew Zealand captain Sophie Devine: \"It hasn't sunk in yet.

I want them to lap up the experience. It is an awesome opportunity for them and a huge part of their career. These are the reasons you play cricket.\" Pakistan captain Fatima Sana: \"We were good in the bowling but we need to improve our fielding and batting because we were not up to the mark. We need to improve or we can't survive at this level.\" England bowler Tash Farrant on BBC Test Match Special: \u201cNew Zealand's youngsters have come to the party in this tournament - like Eden Carson who bowled really well. They've not just relied on their senior players this time. \u201cThey've had a really tough time after the last World Cup in South Africa.

    "Why weight-loss drugs may be no obesity silver bullet\n\nSir Keir Starmer and his health secretary have been lauding the potential of the new generation of weight-loss drugs. Given as regular injections, the treatments \u2013 Wegovy and Mounjaro \u2013 mimic a hormone that makes people less hungry. Not only could they help reduce waistlines, the prime minister and Wes Streeting said, they could also hold the key to a thriving economy. Sir Keir told the BBC it was time to \u201cthink differently\u201d. He was speaking after it was announced a trial would be run by Health Innovation Manchester, a research group linked to the NHS, and drug firm Eli Lilly to see if the weight loss drug Mounjaro could help get obese people back into work. Obesity is, without doubt, a major burden on the health service and wider economy. Obesity-related illness costs the NHS an estimated \u00a311bn a year \u2013 about 8% of its spending. Add in lost productivity, and research has shown it costs the economy nearly \u00a3100bn a year, external \u2013 or 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of all the economic activity in the country.\n\nSo it is understandable there is huge hope these drugs could be the answer. After all, the search for a solution to expanding waistlines has eluded successive governments since the early 1990s. Promoting healthy lifestyles, improving food labelling, restricting advertising and taking steps to increase the cost of unhealthy foods, such as the sugar tax, have all been tried - but rates of obesity have continued to rise and one in four adults is now obese. Critics say governments have not gone far enough with these initiatives, while pointing out public health spending has been squeezed in the past decade, hampering the ability of healthy lifestyle programmes to have an impact. And despite the undoubted benefits the weight-loss drugs demonstrate, health experts have warned they should not be seen as a quick fix.\n\nFirst, the NHS has tightly restricted their use for weight loss - versions of the drugs are also for diabetes. Wegovy, the brand name for semaglutide, is only available as a weight-loss drug for people who are severely obese and living with other health conditions. And it is only allowed to be given under the supervision of specialist weight loss programmes, access to which is like many NHS services constrained. Mounjaro, meanwhile, is not yet being used by the NHS as a weight-loss treatment - although, the official drugs-advisory body has proposed it should be. The criteria look likely to be similar, with the exception it may be made available more widely in the community, without the need for specialist supervision. And how that can be achieved remains to be seen - as patients still need to follow a structured programme of diet and exercise alongside the treatment. GPs are worried they do not have the capacity to oversee this - and so a range of options are still being explored. And the NHS has warned it could take years for Mounjaro to be rolled out. There is also concern the drugs could encourage a \"dependency culture\", where people do not bother with healthy eating and exercise - something Streeting himself has acknowledged.\n\nSecond, even if the NHS was to expand access, it is not clear drug manufacturers could keep up. Shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic, the version of semaglutide used for diabetes, have been reported by NHS clinics, thought partly due to a boom in demand on the private market, driven by celebrities endorsing their use as the \"skinny jab\". Although Novo Nordisk, which makes the drugs, said there should be plentiful supply of Wegovy as it has established a protected supply for the NHS. And then in terms of the rising numbers of people out of work because of illness, the role of obesity is complex to work out. The numbers not working because of ill health have risen since the pandemic, hitting 2.8 million last year. But data from the Office for National Statistics shows the most common primary factors are mental health problems and musculoskeletal conditions, affecting the joints, bones and muscles. Many will also have weight problems - but tackling that may be only one part of the answer to them returning to work.",

In a post on X, explore.org, the nature network that runs the contest, said 128 Grazer was \"the first working mom to ever be crowned champion\".\n\nIn July, two of Grazer's cubs were swept over a waterfall, where Chunk - the most dominant bear on the river - attacked them both, according to explore.org.

The officer, referred to as HA10 to protect her anonymity, said it had been an \u201cincredibly frightening\u201d event that culminated in the death of the 24-year-old in London, on 5 September 2022. That night, Met Police officer Martyn Blake shot Mr Kaba through the windscreen of an Audi car which had been linked to a shotgun incident the night before. HA10 was giving evidence for the defence in the trial of Mr Blake, 40, who denies Mr Kaba\u2019s murder.\n\nThe court heard HA10 was in a convoy of armed police vehicles that had followed the Audi to Streatham, south London, where a decision was made to initiate an enforced stop and extraction. Giving evidence, HA10 told jurors she immediately got out of her vehicle and crossed the road behind an unmarked police vehicle which was rammed by the Audi in front. HA10 told the court: \u201cIt became apparent the Audi was ramming and smashing into the vehicle ahead of it and the police vehicle behind it.\" Asked what she thought the danger was, she said: \u201cI realised in a matter of milliseconds what was happening and I was aware I had to make decisions on what my next step would be, otherwise I was putting myself in danger, potentially being hit by a vehicle.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere was an awful lot of crashing and smashing as you would expect of a collision. \u201cThere was an incredibly clear scream. It was a standout memory without having to watch the body-worn video back. \u201cI absolutely thought that one of my colleagues had been possibly hit by the vehicle.\" Cross-examining, prosecution barrister Louise Oakley said: \u201cDo you accept you were never at risk yourself of being struck by that Audi?\u201d HA10 agreed and also acknowledged there was no scream, saying: \u201cI have been advised the noise has been attributed to a noise of a tyre screeching.\u201d\n\nOn the moment Mr Kaba was fatally injured, she said: \u201cI remember a very clear and distinctive gun shot which was recognisable over and above all the other noise occurring at the time.\u201d The officer told jurors she gave \u201chands-on\u201d first aid to Mr Kaba, who died later that night from the gunshot to the head. Patrick Gibbs KC, defending, asked what the witness thought about the risk on the night. She replied: \u201cAt the time, I was very concerned I was going to be hit by the Audi.\" The officer added: \"It was an incredibly frightening, chaotic experience.\u201d\n\nHA10 told jurors she knew Mr Blake as part of the team but that he was not her direct line manager. Asked to describe him, she said: \u201cI cannot confess to knowing him very well but any interaction I had with him he was entirely friendly, very calm, very knowledgeable, very pleasant to be around.\u201d The witness added she never saw him angry, frustrated or annoyed, the court heard.\n\u2022 None Listen to In Court: Chris Kaba Killing - Police Officer on Trial twice weekly on BBC Sounds",
    "A previously unseen photo of Prince William and his mother, Princess Diana, at The Passage charity in 1993\n\nThe Prince of Wales says \u201cinspiration and guidance\u201d from his mother, Diana, has been a driving force behind his personal commitment to tackle homelessness. In a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child - and how it helped him see \u201coutside the palace walls\u201d. The prince admits he sometimes feels guilty about not being able to do more - and wants to share with his own children a sense of empathy for those facing hardship. \u201cWhen I was very small, my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run,\u201d says the prince.\n\nThe prince is keen to use his platform for \"delivering change\" on issues such as homelessness\n\nIf passion projects reveal something about what drives someone, then perhaps his support for The Passage, external charity is key to unlocking Prince William\u2019s character. The Westminster-based charity provides assistance and friendship for London\u2019s homeless and helps them into secure accommodation. Forged by childhood memories of visits with his mother, the prince's longtime support for the charity has provided the foundation for his current Homewards, external project, set up to tackle homelessness across the UK. \u201cMy mother took me to The Passage. She took Harry and I both there. I must have been about 11, I think, probably, at the time. Maybe 10. I\u2019d never been to anything like that before. And I was a bit anxious as to what to expect,\u201d he says in the ITV documentary, Prince William: We Can End Homelessness. \u201cMy mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone. \"I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone\u2019s not got a home, they\u2019re all going to be really sad. \u201cBut it was incredible how happy an environment it was,\u201d recalls Prince William. The Passage has revealed four previously unseen photos of the prince visiting their London base with his mother, the princess, in June and December 1993.\n\nWilliam recalls playing chess at the charity - and his surprise at the unexpected happiness he witnessed there\n\n\u201cI remember having some good conversations - just playing chess and chatting,\" says the prince, of his childhood visits to The Passage. \"That\u2019s when it dawned on me that there are other people out there who don\u2019t have the same life as you do.\" Prince William became the charity's official patron in 2019, but those visits have continued both publicly and privately throughout his life, often for hours longer than scheduled. In the ITV documentary, the prince is filmed serving food and clearing up at The Passage\u2019s Christmas dinner, hugging some of the regular visitors there. He is even seen being bossed around by the charity\u2019s head chef, Claudette Dawkins, as she organises her royal helper. He speaks about his concern for some of the homeless he encounters \"who are in really bad place... It's like you want to just protect them\". Over the years, the prince says he has spent a lot of time gathering information about homelessness - now he wants to do something practical to prevent it.\n\nA photo, shared by The Passage, from 1993 shows Princess Diana and Prince William at the charity in December, just before Christmas\n\nThe prince addresses the question of his own privileged status - and argues that the point of having such a big public platform is to put it to good use, by taking action on issues such as reducing homelessness. \u201cI feel, with my position and my platform, I should be delivering change,\u201d he says. \u201cI've spent enough time learning and listening to what people have been through that I feel almost guilty every time I leave that I'm not doing more to help. \u201cI feel compelled to act, because I don't want to just talk about it. I don't want to just listen. I actually want to see someone smile because their life has been made better,\" says the prince. \u201cBuilding a project is the only way I can see, at the moment, to try and alleviate [the problem], and help people who are in a much less fortunate, or in a very difficult, situation.\u201d Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, says of Prince William's visits: \"I think he feels most at home when he's just chatting away with our clients and hearing their stories. \"People can get very nervous, but he\u2019s very good at putting people at ease.\"\n\nPrince William's Homewards project, which has six flagship locations across the UK, aims to show homelessness is not inevitable. \"The ultimate ambition is to prove that we can prevent homelessness in these regions, so then others will come along and go, well, if they can do it, why can\u2019t we?\" says the prince. It draws on the experience of Finland, where homelessness was effectively reduced by a policy of providing secure accommodation for people, with wrap-around support for contributory issues such as mental health problems and addiction. Among those William speaks to over the course of the film is Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, who went from being a rough sleeper to becoming a chief fire officer. She has used her own lived experience to advise the prince's current project.\n\nAnother picture shared by The Passage shows an 11-year-old Prince William sitting alongside his mother\n\nLord John Bird, the forthright founder of the Big Issue, has warned of decades of failed initiatives to tackle homelessness, but has nonetheless backed the prince's intervention. \"I am very impressed that a young man who has got young children and could go and live the life of Riley, has decided to make a stand for the work that he wants to do, and the work that his mother did. \"Princess Diana was probably the only personality who shone a light on homelessness. \"What she was saying is, these are human beings and I\u2019m going to address myself to it. And I think that her son, William, has said, this is the legacy.\" Prince William: We Can End Homelessness, ITV1, 30 and 31 October, 21.00.",
    "It has been 10 days since Mozambicans went to the polls\n\nThe lawyer for a prominent Mozambique opposition figure has been shot dead in the capital, Maputo, along with an official from his party. Elvino Dias was the attorney for Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, who ran for president in an election 10 days ago, as an independent candidate with support from the political party Podemos. Dias died with Podemos official Paulo Guambe when gunmen attacked their car. \"They were brutally assassinated [in a] cold-blooded murder,\" said local rights group the Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD).\n\n\"The indications [are] that around 10 to 15 bullets were shot, and they died instantly,\" said the group's director, Adriano Nuvunga. Another organisation, the Mais Integridade election watchdog, said the killings were designed to intimidate anyone demanding transparency in the polls. One of the victims, Dias, died instantly, but witnesses say the other, Guambe, succumbed to his injuries hours later, and allege that police blocked his evacuation by an ambulance that had arrived at the scene to assist them. Witnesses also allege that the police engaged in censorship and intimidation, preventing them from recording the violent scene, confiscating and damaging several phones. The police have denied any wrongdoing, and say they will take all necessary measures to prevent any acts of vandalism, violence, or public disorder in coming days. \"Naturally, we condemn the heinous crime and assure that we are taking all measures to clarify the case,\" police spokesman Lionel Muchina said on Saturday. Tributes have been paid to Dias, described by the Carta de Mo\u00e7ambique news site as a \"shrewd lawyer, intrepid, with the tough fibre of a fighter\". \"Elvino was a good, peaceful man,\" said Zenaido Machado, of Human Rights Watch. \"Last year, during local elections, he led several elections court cases against the election commission, and he won. This year, he was preparing to do it again.\" Election votes are still being counted in Mozambique. Mondlane says he has won, and disputes claims by the establishment Frelimo party that they are in the lead. He has called for a nationwide strike on Monday. The European Union, whose observer mission is in Mozambique monitoring the electoral process, called the killings an outrageous crime and urged the government to conduct an independent investigation. The European bloc said these events followed \"worrying reports about violent dispersion of supporters in the aftermath of last week's election\". Western observers have cast doubt on the credibility of the election. Vote-buying, inflated voter rolls in Frelimo strongholds, and voter intimidation have been reported by the US-based International Republican Institute, which sent a multinational election observer mission to Mozambique. Mozambique has only ever been governed by one party - Frelimo - which has ruled the southern African nation for half a century since independence from Portugal. The country is guaranteed a new president because President Filipe Nyusi is stepping down after serving the two-term limit. His successor, the leader of Frelimo, is 47-year-old Daniel Chapo. His rivals in this election are Mondlane who has the backing of Podemos, Ossufo Momade, the former rebel commander-turned-leader of the main opposition party Renamo, and Lutero Simango from the Mozambique Democratic Movement. A civil war between the Frelimo government, with support from Cuba and the USSR, and the anti-communist Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) rebels took place from 1977 to 1992. The conflict resulted in more than a million people dying in the fighting and in subsequent famines. Renamo remains Mozambique's largest opposition party, and was the springboard for Mondlane's political career before he defected to the newly formed Podemos earlier this year. Mozambique is rich in natural resources including rubies and gas, but is also struggling with an Islamist insurgency in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, where soldiers from dozens of countries have been deployed to help.\n\nVen\u00e2ncio Mondlane of the Podemos party is running for president",
    "Jonathan Edge took cash-in-hand payments for the devices he prepared at home\n\nA man who sold Firestick devices he reconfigured to allow people to illegally stream Premier League football matches and ignored warnings to stop has been jailed. Jonathan Edge, from Liverpool, uploaded the unauthorised services onto the Amazon products at home and then sold them for them cash after advertising on Facebook. The 29-year-old pleaded guilty to three fraud offences after a private prosecution by the Premier League and was jailed for three years and four months at Liverpool Crown Court. Kevin Plumb, representing the league, said efforts to protect broadcast rights would continue by cracking down on illegal operators \u201cno matter the scale\u201d.\n\nEdge was also sentenced for accessing and viewing the illicit football streams he was selling on. The court heard he ran the operation for cash-in-hand payments and continued despite warnings by the Premier League to stop.\n\n\u201cMany people see no harm in illegally streaming TV services but they are wrong,\" Det Sgt Steve Frame, from Merseyside Police, said. He said Edge's sentence should \"serve as a further warning how seriously such copyright theft continues to be taken\". Mr Plumb said the selling of Premier League broadcast rights helped support \"financial contributions to the whole football pyramid\". \"We\u2019re pleased that the courts have once again recognised the importance of safeguarding these rights,\" he added. Keiron Sharp, of the intellectual property rights watchdog FACT, said those who create an illegal business to sell stolen content will be investigated, \"regardless of their level of operation or advertising methods\". In a statement, the Premier League added: \"Edge ignored multiple warnings to stop this activity, which was referenced by the judge and treated as an aggravating factor towards the sentence passed. \"The judge also recognised that legitimate subscribers are victims of these fraudulent operations and therefore their impact goes beyond that experienced by the broadcast industry.\"",

    "Pollution has been worsening in recent days\n\nAir pollution in India's capital Delhi has soared to extremely severe levels, choking residents and engulfing the city in thick smog. Monitors recorded pollution levels of 1,500 on the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 15:00 IST (09:30 BST), according to tech company IQAir - 15 times the level the World Health Organization (WHO) considers satisfactory for breathing. The toxic air has disrupted flight services, and had already prompted authorities to shut schools and ban construction work in the city. It comes just weeks after Lahore, in neighbouring Pakistan, also recorded pollution levels above 1,000.\n\nAnd experts warn that the situation could get worse in Delhi in the coming days, saying more severe measures may be needed to combat the city's pollution problem. According to the WHO, air with AQI values above 300 are considered to be hazardous for health. India's pollution control authority has classified the air in Delhi as \"severe plus\", after the city passed 450 according to its measurements on Monday morning. As well as shutting schools and banning construction work, the city has also banned the entry of non-essential trucks into Delhi and has asked all offices to ask 50% of their staff to work from home. Last week, the government banned all activities that involve the use of coal and firewood, as well as diesel generator use for non-emergency services.\n\nEvery year, Delhi, India's northern states and parts of Pakistan battle hazardous air during the winter months of October to January due to plummeting temperatures, smoke, dust, low wind speed, vehicular emissions and crop stubble burning. And every year, the government imposes pollution control measures during these months. Yet, Delhi's pollution problem hasn't gone away. On Monday, Delhi's Chief Minister Atishi said that all of northern India was experiencing a \"medical emergency\" due to stubble burning continuing unchecked across the country, particularly in the neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. She accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of not taking steps to curb the practice despite the problem intensifying over the past five years. The BJP, in turn, has blamed Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for not being able to put a check to pollution in the city. Meanwhile, Delhi's residents continue to gasp for air. \"Woke up with a itchy, painful throat.. even two air purifiers are not making the AQI breathable indoors. Children are breathing in gas chamber,\" one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Another user called for a \"peaceful mass protest on the streets\". \"The air we breathe is lethally toxic,\" he wrote.\n\nDelhi is enveloped in a thick blanket of smog on most mornings",
    "One of the sexual offences Hugh Nelson admitted was intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of the rape of a child under the age of 13\n\nA graphic design student used artificial intelligence to create child abuse images that he then sold to other paedophiles. Hugh Nelson, 27, from Bolton, accepted requests in online chatrooms for \"bespoke\" explicit computer-generated images depicting children being harmed. The ex-student with a Masters in graphics, who admitted 11 offences, also used images of real children for some AI \"artwork\", Bolton Crown Court heard. Judge Martin Walsh said the case, which police have called \"a landmark\" prosecution, was \"difficult and troubling\" and he would sentence Nelson on Monday as he needed to reflect carefully on it.\n\nNelson frequently discussed child sexual abuse with other chatroom users and on three separate occasions encouraged the rape of children aged under 13, the court heard. David Toal, prosecuting, said the case resulted from Operation Influence, an investigation into the \"creation and developing trends of AI in relation to child sexual exploitation\". He added: \"The use of AI is rapidly improving and the imagery is becoming more realistic.\"\n\nThe defendant was unmasked as the administrator of a paedophile chatroom when he engaged in a conversation with an undercover officer in May last year, said Mr Toal. Nelson told the officer he took commissions from customers for images created by 3D modelling software and went on to send computer-generated images which depicted child sexual abuse.\n\nMr Toal said: \"The defendant said he had over 60 characters in total, ranging from six months to middle-aged, and he charged \u00a380 to create a new character. Nelson, who had no previous convictions, was arrested at his family home in Egerton in June last year and told police he had a sexual interest mainly in girls aged about 12. He said he had met like-minded people on the internet and eventually began to create images for sale as he considered his offending \"had got out of control\", the court heard. Various devices were seized and were found to contain a large quantity of indecent images as well as chats online with adults in France, Italy and the United States regarding the sexual exploitation and rape of children, although there was no evidence before the court to say any child had been sexually or physically assaulted.\n\nBob Elias, defending, said Nelson was a \"shy, gauche man\" who led a \"lonely, socially isolated existence\" in his bedroom at his family home. He said: \"What he was seeking primarily was validation, congratulations and a sense of belonging in a community. \"He was earning relatively small amounts of money and desperately wanted validation. \"He has brought his life crashing down around him to the shock and horror of his immediate family.\" Nelson had recognised the depravity of his actions and had apologised for them in a letter to the judge, the court heard. The defendant pleaded guilty in August to various sexual offences including intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of the rape of a child under the age of 13, making and distributing indecent images of children, and attempting to incite a child aged under 16 to engage in sexual activity.",
    "A serving police office in South West England has been arrested on suspicion of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The officer, a constable aged in his thirties, was arrested on Tuesday in Gloucestershire by counterterrorism police, who said the suspected support \"relates to activity online\". He has been taken to a police custody unit outside Gloucestershire. Specialist officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) made the arrest on a property in Gloucester, and also searched a vehicle and address in the area, police said.\n\nGloucestershire Police Assistant Chief Constable Arman Mathieson said the searches aimed to find digital devices for analysis. \u201cThe arrest of a serving officer on suspicion of such a serious offence will no doubt cause our communities concern, as it does everyone who works for Gloucestershire Police,\" he added. \u201cThe arrest has been made to allow for a prompt and effective investigation to take place and we must not draw any conclusions at this stage.\u201d It's an offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act to provide support for a proscribed terrorist group. Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah, more commonly known as Hamas, has ruled Gaza since 2007. It was proscribed in its entirety in the UK in 2021. The group was responsible for the 7 October 2023 attacks, which saw hundreds of gunmen enter southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel retaliated by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A week after the 7 October attacks, the government's independent reviewer of terrorism warned speeches at pro-Palestinian rallies in the UK might have glorified terrorism. \"People need to know, if you glorify that you risk committing a really serious terrorism offence,\" Jonathan Hall KC said at the time. Then-home secretary Suella Braverman also said \"the full force of the law\" should be used against support for Hamas. Members of the Conservative government urged the Metropolitan Police to increase patrols, claiming people were \"glorifying the terrorist activities of Hamas\". In April this year, a man was found guilty of wearing a headband in support of Hamas at a pro-Palestinian rally in central London.",

    "'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family\u2019s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent\n\nSha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza\n\nWarning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act. This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October. In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son. The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: \u201cDon\u2019t be worried, I am OK dad\u2026 I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him. \u201cThree times I tried to pull him [Abdulrahman] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.\u201d His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire. Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza\u2019s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family\u2019s tent were shared around the world on social media. There are burns all over Ahmed\u2019s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: \u201cThey broke my heart, and they broke my spirit\u2026 I wish the fire had burned me.\u201d The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday). The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas \"command and control\" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.\n\nAhmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family\n\nFour people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was \u201creviewing the incident\u201d. A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians. \u201cIsrael has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.\u201d The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.\n\nPalestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people\n\nPeople are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war. Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras. But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help. In the days following his death Sha'aban\u2019s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life. The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same. \u201cWe saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood\u2026 All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.\u201d We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.\n\nIn a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers. \u201cWe live in very hard circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.\u201d In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza. The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother. But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings. \u201cI was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain\u2026 My brother\u2019s leg was trapped and he couldn\u2019t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand. \"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.\u201d Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: \u201cI\u2019ll work for you.\u201d\n\nMohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire\n\nMohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made. \u201cWe managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink\u2026 then everything was lost.\u201d He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet. \u201cWithout it, I wouldn\u2019t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.\u201d This is his only memento of the woman who was \u201cthe kindness in our home\". The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die. \u201cI can\u2019t describe it. I can\u2019t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.\u201d Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: \u201cWhat more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.\u201d",

Here under low, grey autumn skies the six remaining representatives of that huge and heroic moment, the men who were actually there, went quietly past in wheelchairs, with a collective age of 595 years.\n\nIt included 101-year-old Joe Randall, who was aged 20 at D-Day, and who had helped build temporary airfields for the invasion force liberating Europe from Nazism. There\u2019s an immense poignancy to such moments, literally watching history moving out of sight.\n\nWith a military band playing marches, the Spirit of Normandy group were brought past the Cenotaph, part of a long stream of veterans paying their homage, each bringing their own memories as they laid their wreaths. Like a marathon runner determined to cross the line, the very last veteran in the march-past had got out of a wheelchair and was helped on to a walking frame, so he could walk upright past the Cenotaph. It was a slow, stubborn defiance of the passing years, paying his respects his own way, when all the other groups had finished, cheered on by the crowds nearby on the pavement. The youngest contingent was also an emotional moment, in a different way from the ranks of grey-haired ex-military marchers. There were children and young people, from nine years old and upwards, who had lost a parent in the armed forces, brought together by the Scotty\u2019s Little Soldiers charity. All those years of missing a loved one still to come.\n\nBereaved children of armed forces personnel also took part in the march past\n\nThere\u2019s an irresistible sense of the importance of time at such events. Big Ben tolling out across Whitehall. The eleventh hour, the two-minute silence. The band keeping time, the marchers keeping step. The autumn leaves on a Whitehall empty of traffic. For a few moments people even did the unthinkable - putting down their mobile phones. Leading events was King Charles and what was he thinking about his own past year? He has carried on working despite suffering from cancer. On his 76th birthday this week he will be out supporting food banks. As he stared solemnly straight ahead at the Cenotaph, was this his own commitment to public service, duty and endurance? Catherine, the Princess of Wales, was looking down from the Foreign Office balcony, recovering from her own year of health problems. Much has changed since she stood there last year.\n\nThe Princess of Wales watched on from the balcony of the Foreign Office\n\nIt's been a different kind of upheaval this year for the politicians present. Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch were laying wreaths for the first time as prime minister and leader of the opposition. It was a day to remember previous wars, but the new ministers must have been thinking too of the conflicts raging today and wondering about where they could lead. Behind where Sir Keir was standing, a Ukrainian flag was hanging limply over the Foreign Office building, without any wind to make it fly. For all of those present, the royals, the veterans, the political leaders, the crowds, the focal point for Remembrance is the Cenotaph, the memorial standing in the middle of Whitehall.\n\nIt becomes a kind of altar as well as a monument, as Whitehall temporarily becomes a mixture of a church, military parade ground and national shrine. Part of the Cenotaph's power is its plainness. There's almost no ornamentation or religious imagery. That might help it fit in with a modern, eclectic, multi-faith world, with representatives of more than 20 different religions and beliefs gathered around it. The Cenotaph as we see it now is a permanent structure made from Portland stone, but it began as a temporary, wooden structure. There were people who thought it shouldn't be on Whitehall, as it might get in the way. And perhaps that's its point. It's there to get in the way, a sometimes awkward reminder, to make people remember if they were ever tempted to forget.",

    "How Gary Lineker went from football sensation to BBC star\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: 'Any good?' Lineker kicks off 25 years as MOTD host\n\nGary Lineker, who will leave Match of the Day at the end of this season, BBC News understands, has been the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies. As host of the flagship show for 25 years, he is also one of the corporation's highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million last year. His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless. But they were the result of years of honing his craft and presenting skills.\n\nGary Lineker celebrated qualifying for Euro 92 after the match between Poland and England in 1991\n\nAs a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career. His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.\n\nEven while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.\n\u2022 None Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team. \"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014. \"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\" His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit. But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".\n\nLineker won the Golden Boot, for leading goal scorer, at Mexico's 1986 World Cup\n\nHis early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told the BBC's Media Show's Ros Atkins in 2021. Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\", he said. \"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\" Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts, external and carving out a role for himself. Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker presenting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football. \u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019. \"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\" Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final. Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.\n\nDavid Gower, Nick Hancock, Rory McGrath and Gary Lineker on They Think It's All Over in 2002\n\nHe also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003. As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997. By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit. This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam. \"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said. \"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing. \"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"\n\nLineker said Des Lynam was \"the doyen of sports presenters and a tough act to follow\"\n\nBy 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain. People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen. Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own. He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did. Their friendships often shone through. In June this year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.\n\nClimbing to the top: Lineker tries out a climbing wall\n\nBut despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward. As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny. Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality. In March last year, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him. Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence. Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue. BBC director general Tim Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation. Lineker was reinstated nine days later. The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\". \"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.\n\nGary Lineker and Alan Shearer have fronted many major football tourments\n\nThe headlines and dramas generated by his online views reinforced not only his high celebrity status - but also how keen the BBC was to hang on to him. The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning. Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\". By February this year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk. Despite this, he and the BBC are still parting company, and its flagship football show no longer has a host. Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger. It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at this year's Podcast Awards. But for the BBC, Lineker's departure comes hot on the heels of several scandals. Former Match of the Day and The One Show host Jermaine Jenas was sacked in August following complaints about workplace conduct. In September, the BBC apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, while clearing him of the most serious allegations. In the same month, Mr Davie said he could not see disgraced ex-news presenter Huw Edwards working at the corporation again. Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children. So the BBC is in need of some good headlines - and Lineker's departure means it now has to find an exceptional host to fill his shoes, which will not be an easy task.",
    "Google introduces new way to search by filming video\n\nGoogle has released a new feature which will allow people to search the internet by taking a video. Video search will let people point their camera at something, ask a question about it, and get search results. Android and iPhone users globally will gain access to the feature from 1700 GMT by enabling \"AI Overviews\" in their Google app, but it will only support English at launch. It is the latest move from the tech giant to change how people search online by utilising artificial intelligence (AI). It comes three months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announced it was trialling the ability to search by asking its chatbot questions. Google introduced AI-generated results at the top of certain search queries this year, with mixed results. In May, the feature drew criticism for providing erratic, inaccurate answers, which included advising people to make cheese stick to pizza by using \"non-toxic glue\". At the time, a Google spokesperson said the issues were \"isolated examples\". The results have since become better, with fewer inaccuracies. Since then, there have been further moves to include AI in search, which included the ability to ask questions about still images using Google Lens. The firm said this feature has increased the popularity of Lens, within its mobile app, which has motivated it to expand the feature further.\n\nGoogle's head of search Liz Reid said the new capability would let people ask questions about the world around them more easily. She gave the example of a person at an aquarium, who might want to find out why a group of fish are swimming in unison. Instead of having to search for the fish online and write out the query, the new feature will let them point their camera, record a short clip and ask a question out loud. Google's AI will analyse the video, identify the fish, combine that with the question and produce search results. Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said this was a \"big thing\" for Google. \"We are now seeing AI in everything and people connect best with visuals,\" he said. \"This latest development further demonstrates new ways of bringing content to life with something like search which is one of the most common tasks carried out on the internet. \"Here lies scope for AI to be truly collaborative and an innovator in everyday life - we are on the brink of AI becoming personalised and unique based upon our usage patterns and habits.\"\n\nAs well as introducing a way to search by video, Google has also released several other updates. It says it has improved its shopping results, which will now incorporate reviews and pricing information from different sellers. And it is also introducing a competitor to the music-identifying app Shazam, which is owned by Apple. The rival tool, accessible through Circle to Search on an Android device, will let people identify songs from a website they're on or a show they're streaming without leaving the app. Google's new features come as it faces growing challengers in the search space, where it is estimated to have cornered more than 90% of the market globally. This includes OpenAI, which revealed in July it was trialling a search feature within ChatGPT. SearchGPT lets people search the internet by asking questions to a chatbot, and it is being tested by a limited number of users in the US. OpenAI's value surged to $157bn (\u00a3120bn) on Wednesday after it raised $6.6bn in its latest funding round from high-profile investors including Microsoft. Google's new announcements are likely a way to combat the growth of rival firms - though none are yet to truly threaten its massive dominance.",
    "Brazil first lady uses expletive against Elon Musk at G20 event\n\nBrazil's first lady has sworn at billionaire Elon Musk at an event ahead of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro. While advocating for tougher social media regulation on a panel about disinformation, Janja Lula da Silva appeared to be startled by a loud noise, joking, \"I think it's Elon Musk.\" \"I'm not afraid of you,\" she went on to say, then swore at the billionaire, who owns Tesla and social media platform X. Musk, who was picked to lead the Department of Government Efficiency in incoming US President Donald Trump's administration, has a complicated relationship with Brazil and its left-wing government. X was briefly banned there this year. He reposted a video of the incident, captioned \"lol\".\n\nIn another post, Musk added two laughing emojis and wrote: \"They are going to lose the next election\", apparently referring to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's Workers Party. Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban on X, after it failed to name a legal representative in the country and suspend accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation. The ban was lifted after the platform paid a $5.1m (\u00a33.8m) fine more than a month later. But Musk is also an ally of Brazil's former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who was found guilty of discrediting the electoral system after losing in 2022. Despite the eight-year ban stopping him from running in an election, he has declared his intent to run again in the next elections, to be held in 2026. Bolsonaro, who reposted a screenshot of the video and Musk's response, said, \"We now have another diplomatic problem.\" Leaders of the G20 nations will be meeting for the summit, which starts on Monday.",
    "Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu is trying to sway US election\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'I don't know - Biden on whether Netanyahu is attempting to sway election\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said he is unsure whether Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal in order to influence next month's US election. He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: \"Whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know - but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: \u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,\" he said. \"And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that.\" Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November.\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel\u2019s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s actions, as connected to the American election.\" Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel\u2019s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November. Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close. A deal before the election would be a major boost for the president and the Democratic Party but appears increasingly unlikely.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has mostly criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has rejected suggestions from Washington that an agreement is close. \"Hamas is not there with a deal. There\u2019s not a deal in the making, unfortunately,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said earlier this month just hours after a US official said it was 90% complete. The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. It has also vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack this week. At his appearance at Friday's press briefing, which came as a shock to reporters in the room as it was his first since becoming president four years ago, Biden responded to concern that Israel could strike Iranian oil fields in retaliation. \"The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike,\" he said. \"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.\" Biden caused oil prices to rise on Thursday when he said the US was discussing with Israel the possibility of strikes on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure.",

    "US actor Ron Ely, best known for playing the role of Tarzan in the 1960s television show of the same name, has died aged 86. \"The world has lost one of the greatest men it has ever known - and I have lost my dad,\" the actor's daughter, Kirsten Casale Ely, said in an Instagram post. Tarzan originally aired on NBC television network from 1966 to 1968, during which time the actor broke a number of bones and was reported to have been attacked by animals while performing his own stunts. After retiring from acting in 2001, Ely became an author and published two mystery novels.\n\nEly made a brief return to acting for one television film, Expecting Amish, in 2014, where he played an Amish elder. In the 1980s, he appeared in other hit television programmes including cruise ship-based comedy The Love Boat, as well as Wonder Woman with star Lynda Carter. Born in Texas in 1938, Ely went on to marry his high school sweetheart in 1959, before divorcing two years later. He was also known for hosting the Miss America pageant in the early 1980s, where he met his second wife Valerie Lundeen. The couple went on to have three children. Lundeen was stabbed to death aged 62 by their son, Cameron, at their California home in 2019. He was then shot dead by police after being deemed a threat by attending officers. Ron Ely filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the force, though the judge ruled the officers had acted in self-defence.

Mr Salmond\u2019s political influence extended within and, yes, beyond Scotland, for no one in the last half century has come as close as he did to remoulding, resetting the boundaries and borders of these islands, to redrawing the map of the UK. For all the arguments of our politics, there is perhaps none more fundamental than where the frontiers of the state lie, and Mr Salmond personified a movement that came closer to shifting them than any other in the modern era.\n\nA lifelong personal zeal for Scottish independence energised his mission to shift his cause from a sidebar to the mainstream, and to within a whisker of it actually happening. He never managed it \u2014 \u201cthe dream shall never die\u201d he said after defeat in the referendum in 2014. His very public fallout with his successor as first minister Nicola Sturgeon is well documented. He was also cleared of sexually assaulting a number of women after a high profile trial. His dream for Scottish independence remains unfulfilled, but its pursuit reshapes Scottish politics to this day. It is a nation, a polity recast in his time and split pretty much down the middle on its constitutional future. Mr Salmond\u2019s role in shaping that future cannot be underestimated. He was a primary colours politician \u2014 waspish, pugnacious, unrelenting, engaging \u2014 and at once complicated and undoubtedly controversial, in his politics and his personal conduct. But he was, above all, a man of consequence.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "'Rightmove is my porn' - the addiction to online property search\n\nKatie Smith will regularly go \"Rightmove stalking\" of the houses she has seen for sale\n\nKatie Smith has had an addiction for as long as she can remember. Something she feels compelled to do dozens of times a day. The 30-year-old finds herself repeatedly opening the Rightmove app, despite the fact she has no intention of moving house anytime soon. \"Rightmove is my porn,\" laughs Katie, from Stone, Staffordshire. \"It's like being a modern day peeping Tom,\" she says, referring to the number of homes she looks inside, all from the comfort of her smartphone. Last week, after a day trip to Knutsford, Cheshire, she spent the evening looking at all the houses for sale there - regardless of price. And during a recent weekend in London, she loved looking at \"how expensive houses in Richmond are\", which was close to her hotel. Property portals like Rightmove, Zoopla and On the Market are goldmines of user data about both homebuyers and sellers. Zoopla told the BBC that 1,860 properties are viewed every minute on its website and app, while the figure is even higher for Rightmove \u2013 nearly 10,000 properties viewed per minute. Rightmove recently rejected a fourth takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s REA Group, saying the latest \u00a36.2bn offer undervalued the company, external and its future prospects, showing just how valuable the data it holds is. The websites themselves acknowledge that not all their users may actually be looking to move home, so what is it that keeps people scrolling?\n\nKatie, who previously worked in interior design, says she loves to check how quickly properties might sell and has a list of favourite homes she has looked at. \"I love character properties, things with features like beautiful Georgian homes,\" she says. While she and her partner are planning to move out of her rented accommodation in about six months, there is no immediate or urgent need to search. \"He thinks I am looking at more houses because of this, but it's not - it's just because I love it!\u201d\n\nSam Kennedy Christian, who lives in Herne Bay in Kent with her husband and two children, uses Zoopla to look at her dream purchases. \"I love imagining what I'd get if we won the lottery... specifically in the Isle of Man where I grew up and my family still live,\" she says.\n\nSam Kennedy Christian uses Zoopla to look at houses both in her local market and in the area where she grew up\n\nThey moved closer to the seaside during the pandemic as many people looked for more outdoor space. Sam says she enjoys refreshing the Zoopla app as part of her \"bedtime scrolling\" routine, or while waiting for the baby to drop off to sleep. She also keeps an eye on similar properties in the local market, although they are not intending to sell anytime soon. \"I especially love a floorplan - you can get a real handle on a house, and how you might use the space.\"\n\nWhen we browse property websites, we\u2019re engaging in \u201ca form of escapism that taps into the brain\u2019s reward systems,\" says Louisa Dunbar, the founder of OrangeGrove, a research agency that uses behavioural science to improve business websites. \"Visualising ourselves in these desirable homes triggers the dopamine system, giving us a sense of pleasure, even if we\u2019re not planning to buy. It\u2019s a chance to mentally step into a better life.\u201d She says that certain features of property portals can play a big role on what we might click on. High-quality photos may encourage viewers to picture themselves living in a property, while the use of badging listings with terms like \"Highlight\" or \"Just added\" fuels the fear of missing out. These psychological triggers can keep us engaged as we nose around the neighbour's living room, or imagine a better future, she says.\n\nIdly browsing online property listings is a favourite pastime for many people\n\nUsers may love these property sites, but are they worth it to estate agents, given most online viewings will not turn into actual enquiries? Some agents have expressed unease at the high cost to advertise, particularly on Rightmove as the market leader. They say they provide all the photos and listings information about the houses for sale and are then having to pay to do it. It means these high costs can limit their ability to advertise in local newspapers or other places. One estate agent, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a case of not being able to live without the likes of Rightmove. The prices [for estate agents] are going up faster than I\u2019d like and I worry about the stranglehold they have on the market. \u201cBut, even if many users are just idly browsing without any real intention of moving, it is still worth it to have properties on there.\u201d Rightmove responded, saying it has \"a variety of different packages to suit businesses of different sizes and needs and the average [agent] spends \u00a31,497 per month\". Both Rightmove and Zoopla are bullish about the future, saying that confidence in the market is recovering as mortgage rates fall. On Thursday, Zoopla said the number of homes for sale on its platform is growing. And for now they seem to be attracting everyone whether you're an idle browser just nosing around, fantasising perhaps about castles you can never afford, a homeowner checking on how the value of your home compares with your neighbours\u2019, or even an actual genuine buyer.",
    "From Wimbledon to VAR, is tech hurting the drama of sport?\n\nLine judges will no longer feature at Wimbledon from next year\n\n\"The drama of a player shouting and making a challenge, and the crowd watching the screen and waiting for Hawk-Eye to make a decision, all of that drama is now lost.\" David Bayliss is describing a scene he saw play out many times as a Wimbledon line judge - and one which the Championships won't witness again. Just as with the many other sports that have embraced technology, the All England Club is waving goodbye to human line judges from next summer, after 147 years, in the name of \"maximum accuracy\". But does this risk minimising the drama Mr Bayliss fondly remembers being involved in - and which so many of us love watching?\n\nDavid Bayliss is pictured behind Andy Murray during a match at the Wimbledon championships in 2013\n\n\"It is sad that we won\u2019t be going back as line judges,\" he says. \"The game has moved on, but never say never.\" He served as a line judge and umpire at Wimbledon for 22 years, calling the lines when Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam, in 2003. Being hit by the ball at over 100mph is, he jokes, \"quite sore\". While he's sad to see line judges go, he says it's hard to argue with the logic. \"Essentially, we have a human being and technology calling the same line. The electronic line call can overrule the human eye. Therefore, why do we need the line judge to make a call at all?\" Of course, even before Wimbledon's announcement this week, technology played a big part at the tournament through Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking system, and organisers are following the example set by others. It was announced last year that the ATP tour would replace the human line judge with an electronic system from 2025. The US Open and the Australian Open have also scrapped them. The French Open will be the only major tournament left with human line judges.\n\nDavid Bayliss looks forward to working in other roles at Wimbledon\n\nAs the BBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human. Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a \"high degree of trust in the electronic line calling\". He points out: \"The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point.\"\n\nWhether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another. Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her \"first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness\". \"A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in,\" the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC. While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check. Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech.\n\nDr Anna Fitzpatrick, pictured here in 2011 in a qualifying match for Wimbledon, said players became friends with line judges and umpires as they would see them at a variety of tournaments\n\nCricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters. He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game. \"I think we need to be careful,\" he tells the BBC. In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated. He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not. However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening. \"The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game,\" he adds.\n\nOpta and their stats have become a key part of football coverage for many fans and broadcasters\n\nOf course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport. Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics. \"Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair. \"That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right.\" Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate the dramatic conclusion to the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics. And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data. Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating. While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love. And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping. \"People love sport because of the drama,\" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta. \"Technology is kind of making it stronger.\"",

The former MP and MSP, who led the country between 2007 and 2014, became ill while attending an international conference in North Macedonia. The North Macedonian government said Mr Salmond had lost consciousness at the Inex Olgica hotel, near the city of Ohrid, at about 15:30 local time on Saturday. Local media reports said he collapsed during a lunch and was pronounced dead at the scene. The Alba party, which he led, believe the cause of death to be a heart attack, according to the Press Association news agency.\n\nTributes have poured in from across the political spectrum, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing him as being a \"monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics\". Salmond's succcessor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said he had been her mentor and that \"for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics\". King Charles said he and the Queen were \"greatly saddened\" to hear of Salmond's sudden death, adding: \"His devotion to Scotland drove his decades of public service \"We extend our deep condolences to his family and loved ones at this time\". Salmond led the pro-independence side ahead of the referendum in 2014, and resigned as first minister after Scottish voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. He had led the SNP to power when they won the Scottish Parliament election in 2007, having previously been the party's leader between 1990 and 2000. Salmond, Scotland's first pro-independence first minister, then led the SNP to an unprecedented majority in the election four years later - which paved the way for the referendum to be held. Under his leadership, the Scottish government also introduced popular policies including free NHS prescriptions and free university tuition fees for Scottish students. After quitting as first minister, he had a spectacular fallout with Sturgeon over her government\u2019s mishandling of harassment complaints against him. Salmond was also cleared of serious sexual offence charges after a trial in Edinburgh in 2020. He had been charged with 13 offences, including attempted rape, but was acquitted of all of the charges against him after two weeks of evidence at the High Court. The women who made the allegations against Salmond - which dated back to his time as first minister - had included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. During his evidence to the court, he said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\" or \"exaggerations\". In his closing speech to the jury, Salmond's lawyer said the former first minister \"could certainly have been a better man\" but had not committed any crimes. After quitting the SNP, Salmond set up an alternative independence supporting party, called Alba, of which he was the leader. He also hosted his own show on the controversial Russian broadcaster RT, but suspended it following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSalmond had a spectacular fall out with his former protege Nicola Sturgeon after she succeeded him as first minister\n\nAlba has approached the UK foreign office for help in returning Salmond\u2019s body to the UK. Its deputy leader Kenny MacAskill described Salmond as being \"the outstanding Scottish politician not just of his generation but for generations far before\" and said he had \"possessed extraordinary charm and a common touch which endeared him to so many in Scotland\". Paying tribute to her former political mentor, Sturgeon said she was \"shocked and sorry\" to learn of Salmond's death. She added: \"Obviously, I cannot pretend that the events of the past few years which led to the breakdown of our relationship did not happen, and it would not be right for me to try. \"However, it remains the fact that for many years Alex was an incredibly significant figure in my life. \"He was my mentor, and for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics.\" First Minister John Swinney said he was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" at the news and extended his condolences to Salmond's wife Moira and his family. Swinney added: \"Alex worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved and for her Independence. \"He took the Scottish National Party from the fringes of Scottish politics into government and led Scotland so close to becoming an independent country.\" Former First Minister Humza Yousaf said he and Salmond had \"obviously had our differences in the last few years\", but praised the \"enormous contribution he made to Scottish and UK politics\". The Scottish Parliament has lowered its flags as a mark of respect to Salmond.\n\nAlex Salmond had been married to his wife Moira since 1981\n\nSalmond was born on Hogmanay 1954 in Linlithgow and went on to study economic and medieval history at the University of St Andrews, where he joined the SNP almost immediately after arriving in 1973. He later worked as an assistant economist for the UK government's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland before moving on to the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked for seven years as an economist, eventually coming to specialise in oil and gas. He served as the SNP MP for Banff and Buchan between 1987 and 2010 and was elected as party leader in 1990. Salmond was elected to the Scottish Parliament when it was created in 1999, but stood down as party leader a year later before returning as leader in 2004.\n\nSir Keir Starmer described Salmond as being a \"monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics\". The prime minister added: \"As first minister of Scotland he cared deeply about Scotland's heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented as MP and MSP over many years of service. \"My thoughts are with those who knew him, his family and his loved ones. On behalf of the UK government, I offer them our condolences today.\" Starmer's predecessor as prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: \"Alex Salmond was a huge figure in our politics. \"While I disagreed with him on the constitutional question, there was no denying his skill in debate or his passion for politics. May he rest in peace.\"",

The tractor was driven through Tenbury Wells during floods at the weekend\n\nA man has been arrested after a tractor driver was seen driving through deep floodwaters in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, which led to damage to shops. The town centre was flooded on Sunday after a wall collapsed by Kyre Brook. In a video shared on social media, a wave from the tractor was seen striking shops and homes overlooking the street, breaking some windows. A 57-year-old was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving and released on bail while inquiries continue, police said.\n\nGreetings card shop proprietors Garry and Sarah Thomas said they were worried about how long it would take businesses to recover from the flood\n\nInsp Dave Wise, of West Mercia Police, said: \"I'd like to thank everyone who brought this incident to our attention and to the local community for their cooperation and support yesterday while we carried our initial inquiries.\" Adding he understood the upset and anger caused, he said: \"Officers will continue to be out and about in Tenbury in the coming days to assist the local community and our partner agencies with recovery efforts following the flooding.\"\n\nA clean-up is ongoing in Tenbury Wells after the main streets flooded on Sunday\n\nFollowing the wall collapse, a torrent of water deluged the town centre within seconds with rescue workers yelling to pedestrians to \"get back\". Garry and Sarah Thompson's Special Occasions card shop was one of those flooded. \"There's a serious problem in Tenbury now,\" Mr Thompson said. \"We\u2019ve got a risk of businesses leaving the town.\" He said it had taken the town \"a good two years\" to recover from previous flooding in 2007. \"So that's pretty scary,\" he added. Paul and Rachel Rogers, from Nature's Design Studio, described how water entered their shop for the first time after windows broke. \"It's caused so much devastation,\" Mrs Rogers said. \"We have buildings insurance but we don't have contents insurance. It's going to cost us.\" The Crow pub also flooded after water overwhelmed sandbags and smashed through windows. Licensee Paul Birkin described it as a \"miracle\" nobody was hurt. \"[The water] actually hit the back wall you know, I mean there's glass all over the place,\" he said. \"Absolutely distraught.\"\n\nPaul and Rachel Rogers, from Nature's Design Studio, were concerned insurers would not cover the cost of flood damage\n\nWorcestershire county councillor David Chambers described his frustration over the lack of flood defences in the town. The Conservative member said: \"We're lobbying as hard as we possibly can and I have to say there's real frustration now that progress doesn't seem to be happening.\" The Environment Agency said it had been complex to design a scheme in keeping with the town's heritage and funding was needed to deliver it. \"We're working tirelessly to try and get something because we see the impact that Tenbury\u2019s had and it\u2019s not sustainable for that community at all,\" said Nick Green, from the agency.\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Hereford & Worcester",
    "Fixing social care is urgent, says minister, after claims of impasse\n\nReforming the social care system in England is \"urgent\", cabinet minister Louise Haigh has said, after sources told the BBC there was a \"genuine impasse\" at the top of government over the issue. The transport secretary said the government had already taken steps to improve pay and tackle vacancies in the sector, as well as giving councils an extra \u00a3600m in funding for adult and children's social care. In its election manifesto, Labour promised to create a National Care Service to deliver consistent care across the country - but so far the party has given little detail on what this would look like.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for cross-party talks on how to reform the system in the long-term, but said there also needed to be \"immediate measures\". The prime minister, health secretary and chancellor are due to meet in the next 10 days to discuss the issue. Multiple sources have told the BBC the Department of Health is keen to proceed with an overhaul of the social care system but that the Treasury is reluctant to commit to significant costs without clear political backing from Number 10.\n\n\"It\u2019s really urgent that we fix this issue,\" Haigh said. \"For too long we\u2019ve let this problem fester.\" Pressed over whether the government was taking the problem seriously, she told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the health secretary had already set out a 10-year plan for the NHS which included focusing on prevention and community care, which she said would \"ease pressures on social care\". She also pointed to the government's plans to improve pay and conditions in the sector through a Fair Pay Agreement, allowing negotiations between workers, unions and employers. \"We need to make sure we are tackling those long-term issues in the workforce, with progression opportunities, properly paid and properly negotiated on a collective basis,\" she added.\n\nThe adult social care system helps older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and eating, and covers support in people's own homes, as well as care homes. Unlike the NHS, social care is means-tested and people are usually expected to contribute towards the cost. This means some people face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result. Deborah Crisp told the programme how three years ago her 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, had to sell her flat for just under \u00a3200,000 to pay for a care home - and that amount had already been used up. \"Now that money has gone,\" she said. \"The local authority say they cannot fund her to stay where she is and she will need to be moved somewhere else, and we feel that due to her multiple health issues it will be catastrophic for her to be moved elsewhere - and we really fear for her safety.\"\n\nMinisters are considering whether to create a Royal Commission, with cross-party involvement, to look at how to reform the social care system, or a shorter government-backed independent review. Sir Ed said although the Lib Dems would back a Royal Commission there needed to be \"immediate measures first\" and it \"must not be an excuse for long-grassing this\". He said there were things the government could do \"straight away\", for example on tackling vacancies in the sector. The Lib Dem leader called on the government to be \"more ambitious\", pointing to his party's own proposals for a higher minimum wage for care workers. \"Politicians have been failing on this for far too long,\" he told the BBC. \"There are millions of people suffering, families being hit financially, people in misery and pain, and we have got to tackle this.\" He added that the Lib Dems were \"willing and ready\" to take part in negotiations over the issue but he had not yet had a call from Health Secretary Wes Streeting to do so. Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused the government of having \"no plan\" to tackle the issues with social care. He told the BBC the government\u2019s decision to increase the rate of National Insurance contributions paid by employers would also make it \"even more difficult for the care sector to operate\". Providers have warned these increased staffing costs could force some care homes to close.",
    "Conservative leadership: How does the contest work and who chooses the winner?\n\nKemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick were the final two candidates competing to become the new Conservative Party leader. The winner will be revealed shortly after 11:00 GMT on Saturday. Rishi Sunak formally stood down after leading the Tories to their worst performance at a general election in July, but has stayed on as acting leader until his replacement is announced. That person will be the sixth Tory leader in less than eight and a half years.\n\nEach candidate needed the support of at least 10 MPs to get on to the ballot, including a proposer and seconder. MPs could nominate only one candidate per round of voting. This was a much lower bar than during the last leadership election in 2022, when hopefuls needed the backing of 100 MPs. Sunak was the only one to enter the race with that level of support and so became the party leader. There are currently 121 Tory MPs, but those who are also whips or sit on the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee could not nominate a candidate. Applicants were also told they would each need to raise \u00a3200,000 for the party to progress to the final four. On 29 July, the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee announced six contenders had met the requirements: Badenoch, James Cleverly, Jenrick, Dame Priti Patel, Mel Stride and Tom Tugendhat.\n\nConservative members cast their votes between 15 October and 31 October to decide the winner. They made their choice via secure online voting, though this system has previously been criticised for its susceptibility to hackers and rogue state interference. In recent years, party members have tended to pick the more right-wing candidate of the final two. In the first of two leadership elections in 2022, Sunak consistently won more support from MPs than Liz Truss during each round before party members ultimately opted for Truss. To be eligible to vote, party members had to have been active for 90 days before the ballot closed and to have been party members when nominations opened. The new leader of the Conservative Party will be announced on Saturday morning - at which point Sunak will hand over the reins. The winner will become the official leader of the opposition and of Tory efforts to rebuild the party.",
    "Chappell Roan and Ezra Collective on BBC Sound of 2025 list\n\nChappell Roan has also been nominated for six Grammy Awards\n\nBBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 longlist has been announced, with breakout stars like Chappell Roan and Barry Can't Swim joined by newcomers including Myles Smith and Good Neighbours. The award is given to rising artists with \"the best chance of mainstream success\" in the next 12 months. Past winners include Adele, Sam Smith, Michael Kiwanuka, PinkPantheress and Haim. Last year's winners, The Last Dinner Party, went on to score a number one album and a Mercury Prize nomination for their debut release, Prelude To Ecstasy. This year's longlist also includes indie band English Teacher and Northern Irish rap act Kneecap. The winner will be announced on BBC Radio 1 and BBC News in January.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch clips of the Sound Of 2025 nominees\n\nThe 11 acts in the running are:\n\nThe nominees were chosen by a panel of more than 180 music industry experts and artists including representatives from Spotify, the Glastonbury Festival and the BBC; as well as musicians such as Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa, Jorja Smith, The Blessed Madonna and Sam Smith.\n\nPozer posing for the camera on the set of the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland\n\nUS pop star Chapell Roan is the clear frontrunner, after an electrifying year that saw her go from Olivia Rodrigo's backing vocalist to breakout pop star. Rejecting the trend for whispery bedroom pop, her songs are full of cheerleader chants and exuberant hooks that document her coming of age and the discovery of her sexuality. Last week, she was nominated for six Grammy Awards, including best new artist and album of the year, for her debut The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess.\n\u2022 None Find out more about this year's artists, external\n\u2022 None The pundits who voted in the poll Also hotly-tipped are London jazz ensemble Ezra Collective, who won the Mercury Prize in 2023 for their soulful and ebullient album Where I'm Meant To Be. This year's follow-up - titled Dance, No One's Watching - is both an invitation and an invocation, with supple funk grooves that propelled the album into the top 10. Shape-shifting rapper Doechii also makes the list, cementing her rise as one of hip-hop's brightest new voices. Born in Florida, she rose to attention with the viral 2021 hit Yucky Blucky Fruitcake, after which she toured with SZA and Doja Cat. She is also nominated for the best new artist Grammy, and her recent mixtape Alligator Bites Don't Heal was called \"one of the year\u2019s very best albums, external\" by Rolling Stone.\n\nBarry Can't Swim but he can grin while performing at Glastonbury Festival in June\n\nMaking a very different brand of hip-hop are Kneecap, who rap in both English and Irish about the aftermath of the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. The trio, who use the stage names Mo Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap and DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed, released their second album earlier this year alongside a \"mostly true\" movie depicting their origin story. Representing London's rap scene is Croydon-born Pozer, whose debut single Kitchen Stove has been streamed more than 30 million times on Spotify since February. After a period when solo artists were in the ascendance, this year's longlist has a healthy showing for bands, who occupy five of the 11 spots. They include UK pop-rock duo Good Neighbours, who tap into a rich vein of feelgood nostalgia on tracks like Home and Daisies; and Australian electro-pop outfit Confidence Man, already known for their theatrically-choreographed (and fantastically fun) stage shows.\n\nKneecap released both an album and a comedy-drama biopic film in 2024\n\nThere's a second Mercury Prize winner on the list in the shape of Leeds band English Teacher. Combining art-rock angularity with biting social satire, their debut album This Could Be Texas was called \"one of the finest debuts of the decade, external\" by indie publication The Line Of Best Fit. Edinburgh producer Barry Can\u2019t Swim also makes the longlist, following a summer of huge festival appearances that saw crowds swoon to his upbeat, elegaic brand of dance music. The list is completed by rising singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who scored a top 10 hit with the uplifting folk-pop track Stargazing earlier this year; and US guitar prodigy Mk.gee (pronounced \"ma-ghee\"), whose debut album Two Star & The Dream Police has quietly become a word of mouth success. The musician, born Michael Gordon, who's been championed by Frank Ocean, recently made his debut on US comedy institution Saturday Night Live.\n\nNow in its 23rd year, the Sound Of list has tipped everyone from Stormzy and Dua Lipa to Billie Eilish and Lady Gaga for success. This year's nominees may be more recognisable than previous acts were at this stage in their careers. That's down to a change in the eligibility criteria that recognises the difficulties of achieving crossover success in the streaming era.

    "Mysterious 'blobs' are washing up on Newfoundland shore\n\nWhite blobs have been washing up on the beaches of Newfoundland recently, sparking an investigation by Canadian officials. They have been described by resident Stan Tobin as doughy - \"like someone had tried to bake bread and done a lousy job\" - with an odour reminiscent of vegetable oil. Beachcombers on the southern tip of the Canadian province began reporting the strange substance around early September. Ottawa officials told the BBC that they have not fully identified the substance, but preliminary testing shows it is \"plant-based\".\n\nPhotos of the substance began cropping up on a beachcombers group online, prompting speculation that it was fungus or mold, palm oil, paraffin wax or even ambergris - a rare and valuable substance produced by whales and used in the perfume industry. One poster suggested it looked like dough used to make 'Toutons' - a regional dish of dough often fried in pork fat. A spokesperson for Environment and Climate Change Canada told the BBC that they will need to make additional analysis to determine what the substance is and its potential impact. Government officials have visited the site three times to survey the substance, the agency added. The blobs were spotted along the shores of Placentia Bay, on Newfoundland's southeast coast. Mr Tobin, a local environmentalist, lives in Ship Cove, a tiny village on the bay, and regularly walks the beaches.\n\nHe discovered the mystery blobs one day last month, initially thinking it looked like Styrofoam. He's since come across \"hundreds and hundreds of globs - big globs, little globs\" with most about 6in (15cm) in diameter, he said. But when he called the Canadian Coast Guard to report the findings, Mr Tobin was told that was ruled out as the base of the substance. \"Somebody or somebodies know where this came from and how it got there,\" Mr Tobin said. \"And knows damn well it's not supposed to be here.\"",
    "Archbishop of Canterbury to remain in post until new year\n\nJustin Welby resigned from his post last week\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury is to remain in post until the new year following his resignation over his failure to report prolific child abuser John Smyth. In a statement on Wednesday, Lambeth Palace, the London home of Archbishop Justin Welby, said he would complete his official duties by 6 January. Mr Welby announced last Tuesday that he would step down from the role after a review found he \"could and should\" have reported a prolific child abuser to police. He is expected to conduct \"very little public-facing activity\" before leaving the post, the statement said, adding that he \"plans to honour a small number of remaining commitments\".\n\nMr Welby's official functions as the Archbishop of Canterbury - the most senior bishop within the Church of England - will be delegated to the Archbishop of York (the second most senior bishop) during the Feast of Epiphany, on 6 January, which marks the visit of the Magi (also known as the three kings or three wise men) to Jesus. It is the first day after the12 days of Christmas. Lambeth Palace said more details would be provided on this arrangement \"in due course\". \u201cThe date on which Archbishop Justin formally ceases to hold office will be set in agreement with the Privy Council,\" it added.\n\nThe 68-year-old faced mounting pressure to resign following the publication of a damning independent report into child abuser John Smyth's abuse of boys and young men. In a statement last week, Mr Welby said \"it is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility\" for his response after he was first told about the abuse. Mr Welby said he was \"told that police had been notified\" at the time and that he \"believed wrongly that an appropriate resolution would follow\". He also said he believed \"that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England\".\n\nSmyth, a barrister and senior member of a Christian charity, was accused of attacking dozens of boys, including those he met in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. He later moved to Zimbabwe and later South Africa, where he abused up to 100 boys aged 13 to 17, the review said. The report found that by 2013, the Church of England \"knew, at the highest level\" about Smyth's abuse, including Mr Welby who took up the Church's top job that year. If he and other Church officers had reported this to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa at that time, \u201cJohn Smyth could have [been] brought to justice at a much earlier point\u201d, the independent report said. Smyth was under police investigation when he died in South Africa in 2018.\n\nChurch abuse survivors have also called for the resignations of other senior members of the church who failed to report Smyth to police.",

Liz Hatton, 17, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, died in the early hours of Wednesday morning, her mother Vicky Robayna announced on social media. On X, formerly Twitter, Ms Robayna said that Liz had \"remained determined to the last\" and was still making plans for her future on Tuesday. \"We are so very proud of the kindness, empathy and courage she has shown in the last year,\" she wrote.\n\nLiz attending an exhibition of her work hosted by British Land and Getty Images at 2 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central, last week\n\nLiz began a photography bucket list appeal in January after being diagnosed with an aggressive desmoplastic small round cell tumour and was given between six months and three years to live. She was pictured being hugged by Catherine at Windsor Castle in October after being invited to take pictures of the Prince of Wales at an investiture. Catherine, who herself was treated for cancer this year, and William, in a personal message, described Liz as a \"talented young photographer whose creativity and strength has inspired us both\".\n\nLiz and her family saw the Prince and Princess of Wales at a private meeting\n\nMs Robayna said on X that Liz \"was not only a phenomenal photographer, she was the best human and the most wonderful daughter and big sister we could ever have asked for\". \"No-one could have fought harder for life than she did,\" she said. \"There is a gaping Liz-shaped hole in our lives that I am not sure how we will ever fill.\" Ms Robayna offered her thanks to those who helped the teenager fulfil her dreams in her final months and those who liked and supported her work, adding: \"You ensured Liz's last two months were her very best. She flew high until the end.\" She asked people to share one of Liz's photos in tribute and also to support the family's mission to fund research into desmoplastic small round cell Tumour, which has no charity specialising in the disease in the UK. Just a few weeks before she died, Liz had worked with one of her photography heroes, Rankin, at a photoshoot with professional models. After the shoot model Fifi Anicah said the pictures the teenager took were among some of her \"favourite pictures of all time\".

    "Lebanon says 21 killed in air strike in country\u2019s north\n\nResidents said there was no warning before the strike\n\nAt least 21 people have been killed and eight others injured in a rare Israeli air strike in northern Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry says. The strike hit a residential building in Aitou, a predominantly Christian village far from the areas where the Israeli military has carried out thousands of strikes targeting the armed Shia Islamist group Hezbollah. Residents said a family recently displaced by the war had been living there. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reports. But it came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to \"continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon - including Beirut\".\n\n\"Everything is according to operational considerations. We have proven this recently and we will continue to prove it in the coming days as well,\" he added. He was speaking during a visit to a military base in northern Israel where a drone launched by the Iran-backed group killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded dozens on Sunday night. The military said it was investigating how the drone evaded its sophisticated air defence systems and hit the Golani Brigade training facility near the town of Binyamina. It was one of Hezbollah\u2019s deadliest attacks on Israel in over a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said it was a response to deadly Israeli attacks in Lebanon, which the country\u2019s health ministry says has killed almost 1,700 people over the past month. Most of the Israeli air strikes over the past week have struck in the majority Shia south and the Bekaa Valley in the east - areas where Hezbollah is strong. Aitou, a Maronite Christian community located in the mountains near the north-western coastal city of Tripoli, was not a place which would have expected to be attacked. \"Oh mother Mary,\" gasped one man as he walked through the devastation wrought on the village. In the smoke and dust, bodies could be seen on the ground. Residents said there was no warning, just a single, massive blast. However, they also said several families displaced by the war in the south had recently moved to Aitou, and that the house which was hit had been rented out to new people just two weeks ago.\n\nRescue workers attended the scene of the strike, which was covered in dust and debris\n\nA Lebanese security source told AFP news agency that the building was \"targeted shortly after a man had arrived in a car\". The Lebanese health ministry said it was carrying out DNA tests to determine the identities of the remains recovered by first responders at the scene. The main focus of Israel's military operations has been in the east, the suburbs of Beirut and the south - where there have been incidents involving UN peacekeepers. On Monday, a spokesperson for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon would not move from any positions, again defying calls by Israel to withdraw. The UN Security Council has expressed strong concern over some UN troops being injured during the Israeli military's offensive against Hezbollah. Also on Monday, the Israeli military said a strike in the southern Nabatieh area had killed the commander of the anti-tank unit of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan Force. Hezbollah has not commented on the report. The military also said it had struck Hezbollah launchers used to fire a number of rockets into central and northern Israel on Monday. Most of the rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military. One woman was lightly injured by a barrage of 15 rockets that were fired towards the northern town of Karmiel. Israeli police also said debris from an interception fell in the Holon area, south of Tel Aviv, without causing any injuries or damage. The Israeli military said Hezbollah had fired around 115 projectiles into Israel on Monday. Early on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel's air force had over the past day struck \"more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in southern Lebanon and deep within Lebanon, including terrorist cells, anti-tank missile posts, and surface-to-surface missile launchers\", in coordination with ground troops. In southern Lebanon, it said it eliminated \"dozens of terrorists\", dismantled Hezbollah infrastructure and located \"vast quantities\" of weapons and equipment.",
    "A shortage of nuclear isotopes could mean cancer diagnosis delays\n\nLives will be lost because of a shortage of specialist medicine used to detect diseases such as breast and bowel cancer. That is the stark warning from experts who have said the lack of medical radioactive isotopes available in the UK means delays in tests to diagnose cancer. It has also led to renewed calls for the UK to develop its own manufacturing facility, rather than rely on imports of nuclear medicines. It follows a proposal to build a new \u00a3400m medical laboratory at the site of a former nuclear plant in north Wales.\n\nThe scheme dubbed Project Arthur would see a small-scale nuclear reactor placed at Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd, to produce the radioactive materials. The nuclear-based medicine is used to help detect cancer tumours in patients and track the progress of the disease. But there have been no fresh supplies available to be shipped to the UK after a reactor in the Netherlands was forced to halt production for the whole of last month.\n\nProf Simon Middleburgh wants to see the UK have its own nuclear medicine facility\n\n\"For every month that we don't have diagnosis, or a person doesn't have a diagnosis, their chances of succumbing to cancer increase by 10 per cent,\" said Prof Simon Middleburgh, at Bangor University's Nuclear Futures Institute. \"It is actually resulting in people dying from this now. \"These people are not getting the diagnosis, they are not getting those cancers caught early on, cancer will spread, people will die. \"It's going to be hundreds if not thousands due to just this month's shortage in isotopes this time around.\"\n\nProf Middleburgh said it was why he had been backing the case for Project Arthur, which was originally unveiled by the Welsh government in January 2023. A feasibility study was commissioned into the project, and since then a business case is being submitted to the UK government asking for the cash to approve the scheme, providing a home-grown supply of the nuclear isotopes needed for the whole of Britain. \"The business case is there, it's not new technology, it's old technology - we can buy it of the shelf,\" said Prof Middleburgh. \"It's not just a Wales thing - it's an across the UK thing - we're all ready to go, it is just time to press the green button and get on with it.\"\n\nRadioisotopes help medics find and treat cancer in patients\n\nRadioisotopes can be used to diagnose cancer and treat certain types of the disease such as prostate and liver - when they are injected or swallowed and absorbed by cancers from within the body. Using them is a very common way of treating people or diagnosing people in the NHS already. People typically get a dose of the nuclear medicine which is put into their body and it radiates. A gamma, for example, is a type of radiation. When it leaves the body, it can be detected to show its size and location on a scanner. But it should not be confused with external radiotherapy where they blast tumours from outside the body with radiation.\n\nIt is estimated it would take until about 2030 to get a facility up and running, if it was approved now. In the meantime, the UK government's Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to address the current shortages in nuclear isotopes. \"We know this may be concerning for patients and we are working closely with the company involved to resolve the issue,\" said a UK government official. \"We are also working in close partnership with NHS England and the devolved governments to distribute available stock and prioritise patients with critical needs.\"\n\nThe Welsh government insisted it was still behind the proposals for Trawsfynydd, and said it was working with all partners to develop and progress plans. \"We will provide an update on progress in due course.\" However, the Plaid Cymru MP for the area, Liz Saville-Roberts said action needed to be taken sooner rather than later, to help avoid a repeat of the current isotope shortage. \"Welsh government need to be pushing the business case as hard as possible. They need to have it costed, they need to work with Bangor University who will be alongside this, and the UK government has got to recognise - yes - this will cost, but look at the cost if we don't.\" \"We are going to be talking about a cost in life.\"",
    "BBC warned by Met over report into Westwood allegations\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has warned the BBC that parts of a report about Tim Westwood\u2019s alleged misconduct may \u201cinterfere with justice\u201d if published. The external review is to examine the BBC\u2019s knowledge of, and response to, complaints, allegations and concerns about misconduct by the former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ. Mr Westwood has denied claims of misconduct, commenting: \"It's all false allegations.\" The BBC declined to comment. In July, a spokesperson for the corporation said it was liaising with police to ensure that any steps taken - including publishing the report - do not have a \"negative impact\" on any ongoing police investigation.\n\n\"This is taking time,\" it added. Several women have accused the presenter of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in alleged incidents between 1992 and 2017, after a joint investigation by the BBC and the Guardian. In August 2022, a review, led by Gemma White KC, was commissioned by the BBC to examine the near 20-year employment of Mr Westwood with the broadcaster.\n\nIt was initially believed the review would take around six months but a report is yet to be published. In a new statement to BBC News, a Met Police officer said: \u201cWe have seen the report and made recommendations to the BBC as to which sections of the report may interfere with justice if published.\" BBC News understands the report is now due to be published within the next month. In June, the BBC said: \"This is an extremely important ongoing process, led by an independent reviewer. \"As we have said from the beginning, it is essential we fully understand what was known about concerns regarding Tim Westwood\u2019s conduct during his time with the BBC and this remains the priority.\" A freedom of information request by BBC News earlier this year revealed that the BBC has spent more than \u00a33 million on the review so far. It is believed Mr Westwood has been interviewed under caution by the Metropolitan Police four times since the broadcast of the joint BBC News and Guardian investigation. In a statement, police said the offences are alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016. Detectives said they interviewed a 66-year-old man under caution last year. There has been no arrest.\n\nThe women also accused Mr Westwood of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of them said they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18. One said she was only 14 when he first had sex with her. In a video that appeared on social media last year, the DJ was asked whether the allegations were true. He replied: \"It's all false allegations. It's all false allegations. \"I've never done that, period. They're all false allegations. I will prove that as soon as I get my opportunity and trust me, I am ready.\" In April 2022, Mr Westwood stepped down from his Capital Xtra show. The 66-year-old has continued to play in gigs up and down the country, despite some campaigners calling for nightclubs not to host him since the allegations emerged. The Mail Online reported that he had moved to Lagos, Nigeria, for the first half of this year.",
    "Killer 'might have slept' as partner died at bedside\n\nTarnjeet Riaz, also knows as Tarnjeet Chagger, died at her partner's home, a jury heard\n\nA man lost his temper with his partner after a night out before he \"beat and kicked and stamped her to death\", a jury has heard. Raj Sidpara, 50, is accused of murdering his partner Tarnjeet Riaz - also known by her maiden name Chagger - at his home in Leicester on 6 May. He denies murder, but at an earlier hearing on 18 October, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, admitting to killing her, the jury was told. The murder trial opened at Leicester Crown Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard Ms Riaz did not live with Mr Sidpara but had been a regular visitor at his bungalow in Tarbat Road in Leicester since their relationship began some months before her death. Steven Bailey, prosecuting, said: \"This case is about a man who lost his temper with his partner at the end of a night out, and who beat and kicked and stamped her to death in a confined space in his bedroom once he got her home at the end of night.\" The jury was given details of some of Ms Riaz's injuries, including multiple fractured ribs, bruising and lacerations to her lips. A combination of injuries to her head and to her chest were the cause of her death, Mr Bailey said.\n\nMr Bailey added the prosecution's case was that Mr Sidpara inflicted many or most of the injuries to Ms Riaz \"while she was unconscious or helpless\". \"Once he'd inflicted those injuries, he might even have gone to sleep while she died on the floor on the side of his bed in the small hours of morning of Monday 6 May,\" Mr Bailey added. The prosecution said Ms Riaz was dead by the time Mr Sidpara called for an ambulance \"at around lunchtime\". During the 999 phone call, Mr Sidpara was told how to give Ms Riaz CPR, which had failed. Mr Bailey told the jury the CPR had never succeeded because \"by the time Mr Sidpara had called 999, she was already cold and stiff and her jaw locked shut\". Mr Sidpara told the call handler she had fallen over while drunk and suffered injuries that had caused her to bleed, the jury heard. However, Mr Bailey said the prosecution's case was that Ms Riaz's injuries were caused by \"sustained, persistent, deliberate, and intentional application of severe force\". The jury was told how the couple had been out at a bar the evening before, and after Mr Sidpara drove them back to Tarbat Road, they went to see a neighbour, where they drank some more before going home. Both were \"heavy drinkers\", Mr Bailey said. But that night, CCTV from the bar footage showed Ms Riaz \"got drunker than Mr Sidpara\" and that he was \"steadier on his feet\" and even able to drive them back to Tarbat Road \"without issue\". Sarah Vine KC, defending Sidpara, said the jury would need to consider whether Mr Sidpara's \"alcohol dependency\" caused him to behave the way he did when he killed Ms Riaz.\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester",

    "Walker raises a glass as he presents his final Sounds Of The 70s on BBC Radio 2\n\nVeteran DJ Johnnie Walker said \"the day has come I've always dreaded\" as he presented his final Sounds Of The 70s show on BBC Radio 2. The presenter, 79, announced earlier in the month he was retiring from radio after 58 years due to ill health. For his final broadcast on Sunday, Walker confirmed he would not be taking any requests this time as all the song choices would be made by himself, adding: \"I'm playing all the ones I love.\" An emotional final show featured messages from his wife Tiggy and Sir Rod Stewart, before Walker ended by telling listeners \"may we walk into the future with our heads held high and happiness in our hearts\".\n\nWalker became the presenter of Sounds of the 70s in 2009, but his career in British radio has spanned almost six decades. After opening his last show with George Harrison's track What Is Life, Walker then dedicated his second song, Sister Sledge's We Are Family, to his listeners. Walker was joined on air by his former co-presenter Sally Boazman, who said being partnered with him was the \"best luck\" of her life. The pair worked together on BBC Radio 2 Drivetime for seven years from 1999. In a pre-recorded message, Sir Rod Stewart praised Walker for helping the careers of many rock bands. Sir Rod told Walker he had \"propelled the careers of a bunch of unknown layabouts to the top of the charts, and overnight fame and everything that goes with it\". The rock star ended the message by making Walker an offer: \"So if I do manage to get through the pearly gates, I'll have a pint of Guinness, please mate, and guess what? I'll pick up the tab. \"See you later, Johnny. Rock on mate, rock on.\"\n\nWalker joined BBC Radio 1 in 1969, having been a DJ on the pirate station Radio Caroline in the 1960s. He left the BBC in 1976 and later moved to San Francisco, where he recorded a weekly show broadcast on Radio Luxembourg. He returned to the BBC in the 1980s and on 17 January 1987, Walker re-joined Radio 1, presenting the Saturday afternoon show The Stereo Sequence. He has remained at the BBC ever since, and hosted his last episode of The Rock Show on Friday by playing some of his \"favourite rock anthems\".\n\nWalker's wife Tiggy, who sat in on the show as it aired from their home in Dorset, praised her husband for continuing to broadcast after he became \"very ill\" in January. The radio legend was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - a severe respiratory illness that can make breathing very difficult. \"I'm the one person who knows how hard it's been for you, and I just want to say well done for keeping going as long as you have, because you make a lot of people very happy,\" Tiggy said. \"I know there will be a lot of tears out there today, including mine.\" Walker admitted he might shed a tear or two as well as he thanked her for all her \"wonderful care\", adding: \"I certainly couldn't have done the show without that so thank you for that.\" After announcing his retirement, Walker told the BBC: \u201cI get cards from people saying: \u2018You\u2019re the friend I\u2019ve never met\u2019 and things like that. So it will be sad to say goodbye.\u201d Bob Harris will taking over from Walker as the presenter of Sounds of the 70s in November.",
    "Reeves tells firms no more tax rises as she defends Budget\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has told businesses she is \"not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes\" as she defended the tax rises on businesses announced in the Budget. Reeves told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference that despite \"a lot of feedback\" on her tax and spending plans, she had not heard many alternatives. Her comments come after the boss of biscuit giant McVitie's warned it was \"becoming harder to understand\" the case for investing in the UK after the Chancellor's decisions. Reeves announced a near-\u00a370bn increase in public spending in her first Budget last month, of which more than half will come from higher taxes.\n\nBusinesses are set to bear the brunt of tax increases, due to the Chancellor deciding to increase the rate employer's pay in National Insurance, as well as reducing the threshold they start paying it at. There has been backlash to the measures announced, with firms warning not just higher taxes in April, but higher minimum wages, higher business rates, as well as costs associated with new workers' rights, could impact jobs and pay - and ultimately hit the government's goal of growing the UK economy. But Reeves told industry leaders that her Budget provided the \"stability and the platform that we need to move forward\". Asked if she could confirm there would be no more big tax rises on businesses, Reeves said: \"I faced a problem, and I faced into it...we've put our public finances back on a firm footing, and we've now set the budgets for public services for the duration of this Parliament. \"Public services now need to live within their means because I'm really clear, I'm not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.\" While rises in the minimum wage and workers' rights reforms have been praised by unions and workers' groups, bosses have said businesses are being weighed down by multiple changes coming into force at once, with some calling for them to be \"phased in\".\n\nIn her speech to the conference earlier on Monday, Rain Newton-Smith, the boss of the CBI, argued that \"tax rises like this must never again simply be done to business\". She said the policy changes meant businesses were facing \"a tough trading environment that just got tougher\". \"When you hit profits, you hit competitiveness, you hit investment. You hit growth,\" she added. Ms Newton-Smith referred to a recent survey by the CBI, which found almost two-thirds of 185 companies who responded think the Budget will damage UK investment. Salman Amin, the boss of McVitie's, said that most of his investment in the last decade or so had come to the UK, but that it was \"becoming harder to understand\" the case for investing in the country. \"What strikes me is that in the race to grow, we seem to be turning our backs on the industries which have built Britain for decades,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Rupert Soames, chairman of the CBI, said the Budget had made employing young, part time and low paid staff \"much more expensive\". Speaking after Ms Reeves' appearance, he said: \"Many of the things in the Budget are helpful. For instance, the corporate tax road map. \"But there is no doubt here, that in this Budget, business has been milked as the cash cow.\" Last week, a group of major retailers, including Tesco, Amazon and Next, also wrote to the chancellor, external to warn her of the impact tax changes would have. Firms such as Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have said they will face a huge jump in costs and they may need to increase prices for customers. However, others have said that asking multimillion-pound companies to pay more in taxes was one of the fairer ways to improve funding for services like the NHS. \"No-one is questioning that we need to see the tax rises to really help fund our public services,\" said CBI boss Ms Newton-Smith. But she said that firms had been taken aback by the lowering of the threshold for the payment of National Insurance, and that the pain was \"really serious\". She urged government in her speech to consider a number of reforms to improve economic growth, such as giving companies more flexibility around how they spend money using the apprenticeship levy. She also said the chancellor should look at updating business rates for commercial property, as well as simplifying the planning system. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the CBI conference she was concerned the tax burden on business was increasing. \"The new government believes that invisible businesses can absorb these costs, but it is everyday people who bear the brunt, either in higher prices or lower wages, sometimes both,\" the former business secretary said.",
    "Autistic abuse case must never happen again - No 10\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: CCTV footage of children being abused at Whitefield School is shown to parents\n\nThe abuse of autistic children that took place at the Whitefield School in north-east London was \"horrendous\" and \"must never happen again\", the prime minister's spokesperson has said. The BBC has obtained footage of children at the school being shoved into padded rooms, thrown to the floor or left alone, sitting in their own vomit. Responding to the videos, No 10 said the education department was looking at strengthening the guidance on the use of seclusion in specialist schools and would set out more information \"as soon as possible\". Currently the government's guidance says schools can place disruptive pupils in seclusion or isolation rooms for a limited period.\n\nIt also says schools should ensure children are \"kept in seclusion or isolation no longer than is necessary and that their time spent there is used as constructively as possible\". Children's Commissioner for England Rachel de Souza has called for a review \"without delay\" of the use of restraint and so-called \"calming rooms\u201d, following the BBC revelations. In a statement, external, she described the experiences of the children involved as \"absolutely appalling\", saying \"no child should ever be physically restrained under such conditions and with such a lack of compassion, especially those who are so vulnerable\u201d.\n\nRestraint should only ever be used when it was \"essential to keep a child safe\", and then \"for the shortest time possible\u201d, she added. A police investigation was launched after staff at the Whitefield school discovered a box of USB memory sticks containing 500 hours of CCTV taken inside the padded room between 2014 and 2017. The investigation ended earlier this year without any charges. About 40 children with learning disabilities and severe mental disorders were confined for hours in the rooms - typically without food or drink. Six families of the children involved have agreed for the BBC to show the footage. The videos show the children in acute distress and many are seen injuring themselves. Safeguarding expert Elizabeth Swan said it was \"easily the worst footage\" she had seen. \u201cYou look at the children and they're being defeated and responding to that treatment with self-injurious behaviour, it's torture,\u201d she added. The school's local MP Conservative Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the \"jaw-dropping\" footage should lead to \"profound change\". Asked about the footage, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"The department is looking at the guidance in this space but it is clearly a horrendous case. \"We are clear that this cannot and should not have happened and should not happen again.\"\n\nLeaked CCTV footage reveals how special school pupils suffered while locked away in so-called 'calming rooms'.",
    "My Hurricane Diary: The week I nearly lost everything\n\nAnne, Sam and Georgia Frost at home in Tampa, Florida\n\nHurricane Milton tore through Florida this week. Tornadoes, floods and storm surges have left a trail of destruction and displaced millions of people - at least 16 people have died. Anne and Sam Frost are Brits who moved to Tampa in 2023. They have a five-month-old baby called Georgia. On Monday, after learning that their town was in the route of the hurricane, they evacuated home and travelled to Jacksonville. \"I\u2019ve never felt anything like this, to know by week\u2019s end your whole world could be different, not in a good way and not by choice. It\u2019s like grief without the death,\" Anne told the BBC. While stuck in traffic with others fleeing, struggling to find gas and caring for their child they have been waiting and watching anxiously to see if they would lose their home. Anne shared her diary from the week with us below.\n\nAnne, Sam and Georgia Frost's home in Tampa, Florida. The windows are boarded up with plywood.\n\nSam was fifth in the queue for sand bags at 06:00 (11:00 BST). When it finally opened at 07:45 (12:45 BST) the queue was in the hundreds. He also got plywood for the windows - our local hardware store had a collection point. We have done all we can to protect our home and our belongings and now we protect ourselves and our daughter by leaving. We left at around 20:00 (01:00 BST). We passed several dry gas stations and one with a queue formed of more than 40 cars.\n\nHeavy traffic on the journey from Tampa to Wildwood.\n\nAs we drove we passed blue \"evacuation route\" signs. We joined The I-75 which had heavy traffic, like daytime rush hour. We came off at Withlacoochee and there was another 30-car queue for gas. We were going to stop for food but the Wendy\u2019s drive-thru had about 30 cars queued up. Waze, a navigation app, kept us off the I-75, travelling through little towns on the 301. We travelled down winding roads reminiscent of the UK before stopping for food at a McDonald\u2019s struggling to keep up with the unusually high number of customers.\n\nWe stopped at the 7-11 for gas but even here, in what feels like the middle of nowhere with no evacuation order in place (yet), it\u2019s all out. We finally found a gas station with some pumps available and were able to get another half a tank, but as we drove on we passed more which were completely out. We have arrived in Wildwood and the hotel has a sign on the door - no vacancies at all. We are very lucky to have booked in advance. Tomorrow we will head to Jacksonville.\n\nSome of the traffic encountered by the Frost family.\n\nWe set off from Wildwood at 11:00 (16:00 BST). We were warned to stay off the I-75 by the hotel staff. Waze added 30 minutes to our journey several times. We mainly stayed on the 301 but came off it to avoid standstill traffic at Lawtey. We passed houses that would have no chance of surviving if it were to hit this far north. It all took its toll: our fussy baby, the constant nursery rhymes, and getting lost as Waze tried to help us avoid traffic.\n\nIt\u2019s been amazing as a Brit to see the scale of the logistical efforts that go into preparing for hurricanes. From the enormous dump trucks full of sand to the tankers of fuel being brought in; shelters set up in schools and free Uber rides - it's a remarkable effort. Teco (the energy supplier) has mobilised 4,500 linesmen to be ready to restore power. We\u2019re in Jacksonville now and we just have to wait and watch the spaghetti models (a forecasting tool to give an idea of where a storm could make an impact). As someone commented online, \"we don\u2019t pray it hits somewhere else, we pray it gets weaker.\"\n\nWednesday is spent waiting for updates and watching the radars. The skies are grey and it\u2019s raining in Jacksonville. Hope fades instantly as I hear the reporters say how catastrophic this hurricane will be when it hits. Our house is predicted to get the north side of the eye of the storm - all the wind and rain, so flooding is a risk from overly-saturated ground. And then we see that the storm is predicted to hit north of Sarasota, basically in the bay itself. Any further, tiny jump means we will get surge water from the bay as well. I have to stop watching. It is an anxious wait. At around 21:00 (02:00 BST) the storm carries east when the predicted path was north, which means when it hits it will be south of the bay. For us, it means the bay drains and we will avoid surge water, but for those south it means they\u2019re getting that water, wind and rain. Then come the reports of people who remained in their homes calling for emergency services to get them out, but once hurricane force winds hit the emergency services will not be sent out. I watch the cameras on our house and can see the bushes and trees moving. But as the storm moves through we still have a house intact. It feels incredible, how unlikely it was that we\u2019d have anything left and how close to it we came.\n\nI woke up at 04:00 (09:00 BST) and checked the home cameras - they were still on! And we had no flooding! We\u2019ve lost two fences but it\u2019s a small price to pay. We live near a school so they buried the power cables in the area a few years ago and you realise what a difference that makes, but many are not so lucky as 74% of our county are out of power. There\u2019s flooding as far away from the coast as Plant City and Lakeland so I don\u2019t know how we avoided it. Authorities have closed access to Pinellas County entirely while they assess damage. Our county has boil-water and conserve water notices.\n\nDamaged fences at the Frost family's home in Tampa.\n\nTampa has an area-by-area re-entry plan and again I'm in awe at the logistical efforts and planning. The pictures of damage so close to us and in familiar places are devastating and we are feeling so very fortunate and grateful. Our plans have changed as we can get home earlier now if we want to. So instead of staying another night in Jacksonville we will set off for Tampa via Orlando.\n\nAre you in Florida? Please share your experiences.",

Dowden was taken to hospital as a \"precaution\" after she began \"feeling unwell\" during the main show two Saturdays ago. The professional dancer posted on Instagram, external on Monday to say she was heartbroken after being forced to pull out of the series with a foot injury. Fellow pro Lauren Oakley will take her place, pairing up with Dowden's celebrity partner, JLS singer JB Gill.\n\nA spokesperson for the BBC show said the professional dancer will not come back as she \"focuses on her recovery\" from the injury. \"The whole Strictly family sends Amy love and well wishes,\" the spokesperson added. Oakley stood in for Dowden last Saturday, with the pair performing a Bruno Mars medley scoring 39 points. It took them to the joint top of the leaderboard, alongside former Love Island star Tasha Ghouri and her dance partner Aljaz Skorjanec.\n\nJB Gill performed with Lauren Oakley on Saturday night, as Amy Dowden watched from the studio\n\nDowden returned to the Strictly line-up in 2024, having missed the previous series after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Two Saturdays ago, an ambulance was called to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood when the dancer began feeling unwell. The following day, a spokesperson for the dancer said the ambulance \"was called as a precaution\" and that she was now \"feeling much better\". But in a statement on Monday, a Strictly spokesperson said: \u201cSadly, Amy Dowden MBE will not be partaking in the rest of the competition this year. \"Whilst Amy focuses on her recovery following a foot injury, fellow professional dancer, Lauren Oakley, will step in as JB\u2019s dance partner.\" The spokesperson said the \"health and wellbeing\" of everyone on the show are always \"the utmost priority\". Following the announcement, Dowden said in an Instagram post: \"My heart is breaking right now. The past few months I finally felt like me again. Cancer was no longer the first thing I thought of when I woke up. It was choreography, music choices, which dances in which order, what we needed to work on. I felt free again. \"My goal since hearing those words, 'You have cancer' was to get back on the Strictly dancefloor. It\u2019s been such a challenge to get back, one I devoted 2024 to which, with my incredible team, we got there. Something I wanted to do for myself and loved ones.\" She added: \"There was no feeling like it, dancing again in the ballroom with [the] Strictly family\". She also thanked dance partner JB, saying she was \"so sad, so upset and asking why me, why now that our journey has been cut short\". JB replied to her post, saying \"our moments will forever be in Strictly history\". Lauren Oakley then responded with a vow to \"carry your partnership [with JB] forward and hopefully make you proud\". And Strictly judge Motsi Mabuse also replied, saying that Dowden's courage and strength was an inspiration. Dowden was initially diagnosed with stage three breast cancer aged 32 in May 2023, after finding a lump in her breast the day before she went on her honeymoon. The now-34-year-old was diagnosed again later that same year. She returned to hospital in August 2024 for further tests, as doctors were concerned about abnormalities in her breast after a check-up. She was later given the all-clear. Dowden opened up about her ordeal with breast cancer in a BBC documentary, Strictly Amy: Cancer and Me, which was broadcast in September. She also has Crohn's disease - a lifelong condition which causes parts of the digestive system to become inflamed - and has previously spoken about its toll on her health. Oakley, who did not have a celebrity partner this year, joined the BBC show in 2022. Last year, Oakley was partnered with Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy.

    "'Glorious light' goes out - shock at Robins' Coventry exit\n\nMark Robins took charge of 420 games for Coventry, over two spells - the second-most in club history\n\nEven the English Football League's most durable manager has succumbed. Thursday's sacking of Mark Robins by Coventry City is another stark reminder that the ruthlessness of football - and its insatiable demand for winning - comes for every boss in the end. And so, after seven years, eight months and one day, Robins' second reign at the club is over. Ended after defeat by Derby County - their seventh in 14 Championship games. Only Manchester City's Pep Guardiola has stayed at one club longer, across the top four divisions, than the 54-year-old former Manchester United striker managed with the Sky Blues in his second stint. But, despite four Wembley trips, two promotions, a trophy win, and an FA Cup semi-final few will ever forget, Coventry owner Doug King has opted to go in a new direction. BBC Sport looks at the reaction to the decision to get rid of a man the club described as \"one of the club's greatest ever managers\".\n\nLegendary former Coventry City goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic played more than 500 times for the club and was part of their 1987 FA Cup winning team. Ogrizovic, who now works as a pundit for BBC CWR, said: \"Very few things in football shock me but this is a poor decision. \"It's not a knee-jerk decision because I think this is planned and Doug King has got a plan in the back of his mind, although what that is I don't know.\" Despite a slow start to the season for the third campaign in a row, wins against Luton Town and, impressively, at Middlesbrough, seemed to give Robins a bit of breathing space. But Wednesday's 2-1 defeat by the Rams was one too far for King. \"Mark Robins had more to give, look at the club since the day he came in and it's been year-on-year success and progression,\" added 67-year-old Ogrizovic. \"The sun has been shining on Coventry and they got back into the Championship and along the way there were some great memories for people. \"The stadium is full now and it wasn't when Mark Robins first came to the club.\"\n\nSteve Ogrizovic started his career with Chesterfield and had spells with Liverpool and Shrewsbury before becoming a Coventry City legend after 16 years and more than 500 appearances for the club.\n\nAnother former Sky Blues player David Prutton has paid tribute to what Robins achieved against the backdrop of financial constraints and the prospect of dragging the club back up from the bottom tier of the EFL. \"When I played for Coventry they were dark days so what Mark Robins gave back to that football club was just glorious light and illumination,\" Prutton, who had a brief loan spell at the club in 2014, told BBC CWR. \"He's got the same demeanour win, lose or draw which enables a team to climb the mountains they did. \"The fact he outperformed budget and expectations year on year is another feather in his cap.\" Key to that was getting the very best out of the squad and Prutton cites the work Robins did with striker Viktor Gyokeres - now one of the hottest properties in Europe thanks to his Champions League hat-trick against Manchester City. \"He bought him for about \u00a31m and sold him for \u00a324m, so he's ticked so many boxes, on the pitch for the fans to watch, enjoy and love, and off the pitch for the bean counters who want to make the football club a viable financial asset,\" Prutton added. \"We can all get into metrics and statistics but if anyone classes Mark Robins' tenure as a failure I would say that suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of what football means to people who love the game and are passionate about their club.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLifelong Coventry supporter and BBC CWR sports editor Rob Gurney has pretty much seen it all in his time covering and following the club. He says Robins leaving has once again illustrated the contrasting emotions being a fan and a journalist often present. \"Am I gutted? Of course. Am I surprised? Not in the least,\" he said. \"Football doesn't respect a manager's history or reputation, but you could argue Mark Robins was a special case. \"Yes, he left once, under a cloud. But, since his return in March 2017, he's pulled the club back from the brink. \"Winning the EFL Trophy within weeks of his return, instantly endeared him to Sky Blues fans again. \"An immediate return from League Two, after another memorable Wembley trip, cemented that relationship still further. \"Then we saw the League One title secured during Covid, were a missed penalty kick away from the Premier League, and most gut-wrenchingly of all, a toe-nail killed the greatest FA Cup comeback ever. \"Championship form tailed off, completely understandably, after the physical and mental exertions of that semi-final.\" Gurney added that the timing of that hangover was unfortunate, given the club's pronounced public relations strategy coming into this season. \"Then a very aggressive summer marketing campaign 'Think Big, Aim High' fuelled expectations of a promotion push, but a slow start, for the third season running, sealed Robins' fate. \"My perception is the back-to-back wins over Luton and Middlesbrough came as a huge inconvenience to owner/chairman Doug King, particularly the supporters' response to Robins personally, in the face of going 2-0 down in the first of those. \"His, and his players, in-game management, has been scrutinised in recent weeks, although he'd appeared to have bought himself a little more time. \"Now King has made the decision to dispense with the man many fans regard as the modern-day Jimmy Hill, his next one could define the City's destiny for years to come.\"\n\nMark Robins leaves Coventry for a second time having returned as manager in March 2017\n\nAs with any manager departure, the decision has triggered a frenzy of reaction from the club's supporters. Dave called sacking Robins \"madness\" and wondered \"who is out there that can realistically do a better job\". Another fan, Chris described his mood as \"absolutely devastated\" adding \"what a man he has been for the football club. It just doesn\u2019t make sense\". \"Mark thank you for everything you have done, us fans hold you in higher regard than our apparent owner. Gutted\" The club's mini recovery pre-Derby left Jesmondos thinking Robins had earned more time: \"Wow, really? That man worked wonders. Coventry fans would know best but surely he deserved a bit more time and trust?\" Another supporter Jamie said he thought the club's search for a replacement \"head coach\" was a potential sign why Robins' time is over. \"Sounds like there was a touch of some internal politics in this move, with the club statement saying their next appointment will be a 'head coach' rather than a 'manager',\" he said. \"Coventry haven\u2019t started this season well, but not sure it was bad enough to justify sacking their greatest manager of the 21st century.\" The last thought goes to G-Man - who perhaps perfectly sums up the fickleness of football: \"The saviour that nearly knocks Utd out of the cup one minute, to no longer viewed as up to the job.",
    "'We couldn\u2019t get a mortgage so live in a mobile home'\n\nEoin McGovern and his son outside their mobile home\n\nA man living in a mobile home with his young family says owning their own home in the Republic of Ireland \u201cfeels impossible\u201d. Eoin McGovern from County Cavan had a mortgage application rejected when his wife became pregnant, so they moved into a mobile home on the grounds of his mother\u2019s house. \u201cI would just love for my kids to have their own bedroom. Being confined to a small space is very disheartening,\" he said. Housing is one of the most hotly contested issues in this week's Irish election.\n\nEoin McGovern's mobile home is on the grounds of his mother's house\n\nThe Ballyhaise native lives with his partner and two young children. He said: \u201cWe had an initial mortgage acceptance offer from our bank, but then when my partner received her first maternity payment into our account, everything changed and the mortgage was denied.\u201d Mr McGovern added: \u201cIt was a very tough time, because we fell between the cracks. We couldn\u2019t afford to rent and we\u2019re above the threshold to qualify for social housing. \u201cThe idea for the mobile home was a temporary solution until we both could start working again when the kids were old enough for creche and we would be in a position to re-apply for a mortgage, but it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\u201d The 31-year-old hotel worker was contacted by Cavan County Council and informed that without planning permission the mobile home was against regulations.\n\nEoin, his partner and their two children in their mobile home\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame the council, I honestly didn\u2019t realise you needed planning permission because it\u2019s on wheels on my mother\u2019s property,\" he said. \u201cThe council could come tomorrow and take it away, I pray to God that doesn\u2019t happen and I just hope we\u2019re able to get a temporary planning exemption, just to give us some sort of chance.\u201d BBC News NI contacted Cavan Council but a spokesperson said it did not comment on individual cases.\n\nAlthough the circumstances will vary, Mr McGovern and his family aren\u2019t alone. The average price of a property in the Republic of Ireland as of September this year was \u20ac346,000 (\u00a3289,000). In Northern Ireland the average price is \u00a3190,000. James Spring is an estate agent in County Cavan. He believes that with properties at this value, it\u2019s not surprising it\u2019s proving difficult for young couples to buy their first house.\n\nJames Spring is an estate agent in County Cavan\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number one story I hear is about mortgages expiring after six months, then you have to re-submit everything again and if your circumstances have changed, your mortgage offer can be in doubt. \u201cIt\u2019s why housing is such a big issue in this election because young people are struggling, they\u2019re getting out-competed in the market and lending rules with banks seem to have really tightened up.\u201d Mr Spring said it is a \"supply and demand\" issue with not enough houses being built in the Republic.\n\nWaiting lists and social housing are also an issue. There are around 58,000 people are on the social housing waiting list in the Republic. Martin Loughran is chief commercial and development officer with Tuath Housing. The company has just finished an 11-storey apartment building in Drogheda, County Louth. All the homes will be occupied by individuals and families on the social housing waiting list. Mr Loughran believes a substantial increase in projects like this will be needed throughout Ireland to chip away at the waiting list.\n\nMartin Loughran is Chief Commercial and Development Officer with Tuath Housing\n\nIn Northern Ireland recently, news headlines have been dominated by the fact that a lack of access to water and sewerage systems is preventing people from being able to move into homes \u2013 including social housing developments. Mr Loughran said there is a similar problem in the Republic. He added: \u201cThere has been talk of setting up a Department for Infrastructure in the Republic of Ireland to support the Department of Housing in government, we would be supportive of that and I think it\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nHousing has been a key issue in the Irish election campaign\n\nMany commentators will say the Republic\u2019s ongoing housing issues can be traced back to the financial crisis in the late 2000. This saw a reduction in public investment and it\u2019s argued by some, that successive governments have struggled to hit housing targets ever since. Whatever the cause, for people like Eoin McGovern and his family, they\u2019ve been left feeling like the system is working against them. He said: \u201cIf I had a time machine I would try and get a house before I had kids because when you\u2019re trying to get a decent mortgage with dependents in this country, it\u2019s nearly impossible. \u201cThis election will come and go, but things are going to stay very tough out there for families like us for a while yet.\u201d",

    "Seven-month-old Elle Doherty died on 16 June, an hour after being attacked by her family's pet dog\n\nA seven-month-old baby who was attacked by her family's pet dog, died after she suffered a \"catastrophic\" head injury, an inquest has heard. Elle Doherty was on the floor, near her parents, when the 31kg Belgian Malinois made a \"sudden and unanticipated\" attack, Coventry Coroner's Court heard. Area coroner Delroy Henry concluded the attack at the family home in Coundon on 16 June lasted \"less than a second\" as the dog, called Zeus, was immediately pulled away. Elle suffered skull fractures and a cardiac arrest, and was pronounced dead in hospital an hour after the attack.\n\nHer parents did not attend the inquest hearing after expressing what Mr Henry said was a \"wholly understandable\" wish to be excused. A series of freeze-frame CCTV images recorded from an indoor security camera at the family's home, showed the couple's immediate response to protect their daughter. Commenting on the stills, Det Insp Anthony Hibbert agreed with Mr Henry's suggestions that the incident \"transpired within a second or less\" and that both parents \"immediately reacted to this situation by removing Zeus from the equation\" and taking hold of both the dog and Elle. Det Insp Hibbert told the inquest: \"It appears from when you watch the footage, maybe baby Elle slightly leant on Zeus and that is when Zeus attacks baby Elle.\"\n\nIn a written statement, Mr Doherty said the pet had been acquired from a breeder in Gloucestershire in October 2020 and was \"good around people and other dogs\". The inquest heard a dog-handler was called to the scene and used a sedation dart to remove Zeus from the garden. The dog was taken to a vet and put down on the same day. Bringing the inquest to a close, Mr Henry said: \"This is certainly a tragic incident - a family changed forever. \"I really don't think there are any words that I could say to console the family of Elle save to reiterate that my heart goes out to Elle's parents and family.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Warwickshire",

Her sister Yasmine, who is still in school, said she would have never imagined leaving, but the situation required it. Another British citizen, Libby, 25, boarded a commercial flight from Beirut to Cairo on Wednesday morning, and described the situation in the Lebanese capital as \"terrifying\". \"You can't sleep because you can hear the Israeli drones over your head, you wake up in the night because you hear strikes,\" she told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. The chartered flight leaving Beirut on Wednesday will only be able to take a fraction of them, raising questions about whether additional flights will be needed.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey was in Cyprus on Wednesday to meet some of the British personnel preparing for the possibility of evacuating UK nationals out of Lebanon. Britons in Lebanon have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website. Healey's visit to Cyprus came just hours after Iran carried out a missile attack against Israel on Tuesday night. The defence secretary said British forces had \"played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation\u201d. He gave no further details but the BBC understands British military jets did not shoot down any Iranian ballistic missiles nor did the Royal Navy Destroyer, HMS Duncan, fire any Sea Viper missiles. Iran said the attack was, in part, retaliation for the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of its proxy, Hezbollah, in a strike on Beirut last week.\n\nYou can get in touch via this form.\n\nAre you a British national planning to leave Lebanon?

    "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has defended Labour's stance on its staff volunteering for Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. She told the Commons that \"people in their own time often go on campaigns\", adding that \"it happens in all political parties\". Speaking at PMQs Rayner said no laws had been broken and the campaigners were volunteers. Donald Trump's campaign filed a complaint alleging Labour had broken US election rules on foreign interference by sending activists to campaign for Harris, his Democratic Party opponent. Rayner was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer, who earlier played down the row while on his way to Samoa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nRayner was responding to a question from Stephen Flynn, leader of the SNP at Westminster, who invited her to join him \"in applauding the brave Labour staff members who travelled across the Atlantic to campaign against Donald Trump\". The deputy PM replied: \"People in their own time often go and campaign, and that's what we've seen. \"It happens in all political parties, people go and campaign and they do what they want to do with their own time, with their own money.\" The row over campaigning was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from Labour's head of operations, Sofia Patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to America before polling day. The LinkedIn post said she had \u201c10 spots available\u201d for anyone willing to travel to North Carolina to campaign for Harris, adding \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d. Foreign nationals are permitted to volunteer in political campaigns in the US as long as they are not compensated, according to Federal Election Commission rules. Labour Party sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is concern about whether the row could impact the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US should Trump win the election on 5 November.\n\nOn Wednesday, Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill pulled out of a guest appearance at an online event on US election night in support of Harris. McNeill had been due to speak at a Labour for Women meeting called \"Come on Kamala\" in a \"personal capacity\" to provide election analysis, a government spokesperson said. However, her appearance had drawn criticism online and from the shadow Scottish secretary John Lamont, who accused McNeill of \"hosting a fully fledged rally\" for Harris. The Trump campaign complaint to the Federal Election Commission flags that senior Labour Party staff attended the Democratic convention in Chicago and met Harris\u2019s campaign team, naming Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, and Matthew Doyle, Downing Street director of communications. Deborah Mattinson, Sir Keir\u2019s former director of strategy, was also named as someone who travelled to Washington in September to brief Harris\u2019s campaign on Labour\u2019s election-winning approach. It is understood from Labour officials that Labour met McSweeney\u2019s costs, while Doyle was hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, a US think tank. But the officials said it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the Harris campaign, adding that Labour sends a delegation to each Democratic convention. Officials also pointed out that Mattinson left the Labour party staff after July's general election in the UK.\n\nSir Keir briefly addressed the issue during his plane journey, telling reporters: \u201cThe Labour Party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election. \"They\u2019re doing it in their spare time. They\u2019re doing it as volunteers. They\u2019re staying I think with other volunteers over there.\u201d He denied the row would impact his relationship with Trump, reminding reporters the two had dinner together at Trump Tower in New York last month. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson stressed that the UK would always have \u201ca deep and strong relationship with the US as our closest ally\u201d whoever won the election. She was not aware of any plans for government ministers to speak to Trump\u2019s campaign team, but Sir Keir and Trump had discussed \u201cthe long-standing friendship\" between the two nations during their New York dinner, she said. \u201cIt is a special relationship which has endured for over a century with leaders of all political stripes, and that will always be the case,\" she added. Defence Secretary John Healey suggested the Trump campaign was \"creating controversy\" ahead of the presidential election. However, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Trump supporter, told the BBC he believed the wording of the LinkedIn post breached US election law, saying the rules were \"very, very clear\".\n\nFarage, who has travelled to the US to support his friend on multiple occasions, said: \"The ad didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll be going in your own free time, didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll have to pay your own air fare, which at the moment, by the way, are very, very expensive, it said you\u2019re going to have free accommodation. \"If you look at the wording of that advert there is little doubt that is against American election law.\" Filings with the US Department of Justice reveal that Farage himself has received help three times since his election as an MP in July from a PR firm based in Pennsylvania, including with hotel costs on a trip to the USA. The company, Capital HQ LLC, is run by Alexandra Preate, who used to be an aide to Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon. The filings show the firm paid more than $3,500 (\u00a32,700) for Farage\u2019s accommodation at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July. It also helped with his \u201cperception management\u201d, as well as public relations, travel and logistics. Capital HQ disclosed it had also assisted with his appearance on a Fox News business programme in July, in which he was outspoken in support of Trump\u2019s election prospects. It also spoke to him in August about an \u201cupcoming trip to the United States\u201d. The filings were made under US laws requiring anyone who acts on behalf of foreign \u201cprincipals\u201d engaged in political activity, such as seeking to influence policy or public opinion there, to register with the federal government. The Clacton MP has declared \u00a332,836 he separately received from a donor for flights and accommodation for a visit to the United States in July. Asked about this on BBC\u2019s Politics Live programme, Farage said he \u201chopped on somebody else\u2019s plane, they gave me a free lift\", adding that he had declared it and \"didn\u2019t campaign at all\". \u201cI went in a purely personal capacity to offer my support after the first assassination attempt... as a friend of his and the family\".",
    "'Adult crime, adult time': Row as Australian territory locks up 10-year-olds again\n\nA protest was held outside the Northern Territory's parliament in Darwin as MPs debated lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10\n\n'Thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison. Following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory (NT). He was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary. Five years on, the Aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard changing,\u201d Thomas tells me. \u201c[Breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it\u2019s hard to [stop] the habit.\u201d His story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the Northern Territory. For many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. The Northern Territory is the part of Australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average, external. It\u2019s also more than twice the rate of the US, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. But the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. The move, which defies a UN recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.\n\nBusiness owner Sunil Kumar says his restaurant had five or six break-ins in the last year and is in favour of tougher laws\n\nIt's not just an issue of incarceration. It's one of inequalities too. While around 30% of the Northern Territory's population is Aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are Indigenous. So, Aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. The Country Liberal Party (CLP) government says it has a mandate after campaigning to keep Territorians safe. It helped the party claim a landslide victory in August's elections. Among those voting for the CLP was Sunil Kumar. The owner of two Indian restaurants in Darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. \"It's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun,\" explains Mr Kumar. He says he\u2019s improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. \"How come they are out and parents don't know?\u201d he says. \u201cThere should be a punishment for the parents.\" But while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. Youth offender rates have risen since Covid. Last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. But the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the Northern Territory, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show. Politicians, though, are playing to residents\u2019 fears. As well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as Declan's Law, after Declan Laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. \"I never want another family to experience what we have,\u201d said his mother Samara Laverty. \"The passing of this legislation is a turning point for the Territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place.\"\n\nOn the day the laws started to be debated in Darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. One woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. Another asked: 'What if it was your child?' \"Our young people in Don Dale need to have opportunity for hope,\" said Aboriginal elder, Aunty Barb Nasir, addressing the demonstrators. She was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside Darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in Australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. \"We need to always stand for them because they are lost in there,\" Aunty Barb said. Kat McNamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill, told the crowd: \"The idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt.\" After a ripple of applause, she added: \"We are not going to stand for it.\" But with a large majority in parliament, the CLP easily managed to pass the laws.\n\nProtesters opposing the new law argue that jailing 10-year-olds is not a sustainable long-term solution\n\nLowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. And while other Australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. Australia is not alone \u2013 in England and Wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. But in comparison, the majority of European Union members make it 14, in line with UN recommendations. The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Lia Finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can \"intervene early and address the root causes of crime\". \u201cWe have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time,\u201d she said last month. \"And we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more.\" But for people like Thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. His crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. He says he finds prison oddly comforting. It's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. \"Most of my family has been in and out of jail. I felt like I was at home because all the boys took care of me.\" His two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. At one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. Thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now \u2013 his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. He's been helped by Brother 2 Another - an Aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports First Nations children caught up in the justice system.\n\nDarren Damaso, from the program Brother 2 Another, says there should be more investment in services to support young Aboriginal people\n\n\"Locking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,\" says Darren Damaso, a youth leader for Brother 2 Another. \"There needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards Aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. And then we're going to slowly start to see change. But if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work.\" Mr Damaso is from the Larrakia Aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of Darwin, and he also has connections to the Yanuwa and Malak Malak people. His organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. Brother 2 Another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. \"It's a self-perpetuating cycle,\u201d says John Lawrence, a Scottish criminal barrister who's been based in Darwin for more than three decades. He's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. Aboriginal people \u201chave no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm\", says Mr Lawrence. \"The fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.\u201d\n\nThe tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the Northern Territory. In Queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the Liberal National Party played heavily on its slogan: \u201cAdult crime, adult time.\u201d In a recent report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, Anne Hollonds, the National Children\u2019s Commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them First Nations children - the country is creating \"one of Australia's most urgent human rights challenges\". \u201cThe systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer.\u201d Which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. \"What are the cultural strengths of people? What are the community strengths of people? We are building on that,\u201d says Erin Reilly, a regional director for Children's Ground. Her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the Aboriginal 'kinship\u2019 system - how people fit in with their community and family. \u201cWe centre Indigenous world views and Indigenous values and we work in a way that works for Aboriginal people,\u201d explains Ms Reilly. \u201cWe know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people.\" For Thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. But on the outside, he says, there\u2019s little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. \"I felt like no one cared. Nobody wanted to listen,\" he says. He points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: \"So, I hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?\"",
    "UK-Israeli hostage has been forgotten, says mum\n\nEmily Damari loves to watch Tottenham play, her mother said\n\nThe mother of the only British-Israeli hostage still being held by Hamas in Gaza has asked why the UK is not \"fighting every moment to secure her release\". Emily Damari, 28, was shot and taken from an Israeli kibbutz across the border into Gaza on 7 October. Speaking at a London memorial event marking the attacks a year ago, her mother Mandy Damari said her daughter's \"plight seems to have been forgotten\". Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement the UK \"must unequivocally stand with the Jewish community\".\n\nThe dual national is among 97 hostages who remain unaccounted for. Speaking at the Hyde Park memorial event, her mother said: \"[Emily] is a daughter of both countries, but no one here mentions the fact that there is still a female British hostage being held captive by Hamas for a year now, and I sometimes wonder if people even know there is a British woman there. \"Imagine, for a moment if Emily was your daughter. Try to picture what she is going through. \"Since 7 October last year, she has been held a hostage by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza terror tunnels, 20 metres or more underground, kept in captivity, tortured, isolated, unable to eat, speak or even move without someone else's permission.\u201d\n\nThe crowd heard how Emily, who was born to her British mother in Israel and lived there, loved to visit the UK - her \"second home across the sea\". She loved watching Spurs play, going to the pub, shopping at Primark and had also watched Ed Sheeran in concert, her mother said. Her mother pleaded with Britain and other countries to do more to secure the release of her daughter, and the other hostages. \u201cHow is it that she is still imprisoned there after one year? Why isn't the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release? She's one of their own.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Mandy Damari: ''I need to hug her again''\n\nShe said some of the women and children who were released in the hostage deal in November had told her Emily was alive then, and spoke about how she helped the other hostages try to stay positive, even in the worst of times. \u201cEvery day is living hell not knowing what Emily is going through. I do know from the hostages that returned that they were starved, sexually abused and tortured. Every moment lost is another moment of unimaginable suffering or even death.\u201d BBC News has approached the UK Foreign Office for comment. Other hostages with British relatives held include Eli Sharabi, Oded Lifschitz and Avinatan Or. British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell was also kidnapped on 7 October and his body was recovered by Israeli soldiers in Gaza in August. Families of Israeli hostages met Sir Keir and Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Monday, calling on them to \"do more\" to bring them home. The prime minister agreed that the hostages must be freed and returned immediately, a subsequent press conference was told. On Sunday, he said the country must \"unequivocally\" stand with the Jewish community and described 7 October as the \"darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust\u201d. \u201cAs a father, a husband, a son, a brother \u2013 meeting the families of those who lost their loved ones last week was unimaginable. Their grief and pain are ours, and it is shared in homes across the land,\" Sir Keir said. He also reiterated his call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nMemorial attendees held up pictures of hostages during the event\n\nThe Hyde Park event, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups, was attended by thousands of British Jews and supporters of Israel who waved British and Israeli flags with chants of \"bring them home\". Among the crowd, many of whom have family and friends in Israel, there was disbelief that the hostages still had not been freed, one year on. Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely told the crowd: \"We will do whatever we can to bring them home.\" Michael Wegier, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told BBC News: \"The British Jewish community is traumatised like much of the Jewish community around the world, especially in Israel. \"There are 30,000 Jews from Britain who live in Israel. Many of us have friends and family there and we go there, and so we take what happens there very deeply and very personally.\" A vigil to remember the victims of the Hamas attack was also held in Glasgow where hundreds gathered at the steps of Kelvingrove Art Gallery. On the eve of 7 October, a man was filmed damaging a Jewish memorial in Hove. Sussex Police responded to the video, which had been circulated on X and other social media platforms, and confirmed the incident was being treated as a \"hate crime\", external. On Saturday tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors marched through central London calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. At least 41,870 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "A coroner has delivered her conclusions at the inquest into the death of Brianna Ghey\n\nSchools involved with one of Brianna Ghey's killers could not have foreseen that she and her accomplice would have plotted to murder the teenager, a coroner has ruled. Jacqueline Devonish, senior coroner for Cheshire, found the transfer of Scarlet Jenkinson to Brianna's school had been appropriately managed and had not contributed to the 16-year-old's death. She also said Brianna\u2019s own health had not contributed to her death, except that it had made her vulnerable to manipulation by Jenkinson. Jenkinson, along with Eddie Radcliffe, murdered Brianna at a park in Warrington on 11 February 2023.\n\nAn earlier trial heard how she had lured Brianna to Culcheth Linear Park, where she was waiting with Ratcliffe. The pair, both 15, were convicted of Brianna\u2019s murder and sentenced to life in prison earlier this year. The coroner said there had been no reason for anyone to suspect that the friendship between the two girls had been anything but genuine.\n\nBrianna had been a pupil at Birchwood High School, Warrington, where she was befriended by Jenkinson. Jenkinson had been transferred from Culcheth High School after she \u201cspiked\u201d a younger pupil with cannabis-laced sweets. Following her \"managed transfer\" from Culcheth, where Ratcliffe was also a pupil, Jenkinson became obsessed with Brianna and began plotting her murder with Ratcliffe. From age 14, Jenkinson had watched videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers, her trial heard. But these \"dark fantasies\" were not known to either school or any other adults, the trial heard. The three-day inquest at Warrington Coroner\u2019s Court examined safeguarding for all three teenagers, and how Brianna was brought into contact with Jenkinson. But the hearing was told despite Jenkinson\u2019s misbehaviour in school, no-one could have foreseen she was planning to murder Brianna.\n\nConcluding the inquest, Ms Devonish said: \"There was no reason for anyone to suspect the friendship was anything other than genuine. She said there were no visible signs that Brianna was at risk from Jenkinson. \"She had been planning Brianna\u2019s murder since late 2022. Eddie Ratcliffe was the only person who knew, other than Scarlett Jenkinson,\" Ms Devonish said. \"I found that the schools could not have reasonably foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe would have plotted and murdered Brianna. \"It could not have, on the evidence available at the time, reasonably have been foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson was mentally unstable so that she would kill.\" Both Brianna and Jenkinson had a history of self-harm and personal issues affecting their schooling. Jenkinson had also assaulted another pupil and turned up for class drunk and smelling of cannabis. Brianna, who was transitioning gender, had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Her mother Esther Ghey said Brianna had become \"immersed in darkness\", falling behind in schoolwork and spending a lot of time online, garnering thousands of followers on TikTok and YouTube by posting video content. The coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, but said there was no need for prevention of future deaths reports to be sent to either school.",
    "'It didn't have to happen': Wife of man killed at Trump rally struggles with loss\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \u201cI see it every time I close my eyes,\u201d says widow of man killed at Trump rally\n\nThe wife of a former volunteer fire chief killed during July\u2019s assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, has told the BBC she is furious about the security failures that led to her husband\u2019s killing by a rooftop gunman. Corey Comperatore was shot dead after diving on members of his family to protect them as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire at the former president. His wife Helen said she hasn\u2019t been able to stop replaying the events of the day in her mind. \"I see it every time I close my eyes, and probably will for a long time\" she said. \"I'm angry because there were a lot of mistakes made that day, and it didn't have to happen,\u201d she added. Helen Comperatore spoke exclusively to the BBC just days before Trump is set to return to Butler and the site of the shooting. The home she shared with Corey in Sarver is less than 20 miles (32 km) from the Butler rally site, and close enough to the volunteer fire station where he worked for decades that when its sirens blare they can be easily heard. Trump will hold a rally on Saturday on the same grounds where he was shot in the ear, before defiantly raising his fist and mouthing \u201cFight!\u2019, in what has become a defining image of his campaign. Multiple members of the Comperatore family will be Trump's guests at this weekend's rally, including Helen. Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the July shooting and two other people suffered \u201clife-changing\u201d injuries: 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver. A Secret Service internal review has since identified a litany of security failures that day, including poor planning and a communication breakdown. Corey, who was an ardent supporter of the current Republican presidential candidate, had been excited for the July rally, his wife said. \"He just liked how [Trump] got things done, and that he wasn't a politician and he didn't talk like one.\" She said they believe Trump understands the lives of people like them, in places like Butler, a working-class community just north of Pittsburgh.\n\nAt the rally, the family ended up by happenstance in the bleachers between Trump and the shooter. They'd taken time to eat beforehand and missed the opening to get a seat - to Corey's disappointment. But then a man came by and offered them a spot in the stands. About six minutes into Trump\u2019s speech, Crooks fired eight shots from a roof just outside the rally\u2019s perimeter, one striking Trump\u2019s right ear and one striking and killing Corey as he sheltered his family.\n\nIn the months before her husband was killed, the couple spent every weekend on their boat. \"We loved that time together,\" Helen said. \"We talked about everything. We made a lot of future plans on that boat. I knew a lot about Corey and what his wishes were, if anything ever happened to him.\" The couple had known one another their entire lives - they began attending school together as kindergartners. She said her husband often appeared straight-faced and serious, but behind the fa\u00e7ade was a deeply kind and caring man. \"As soon as he smiled, you knew he was a good, good man,\" she said. \"He did anything for his community. He loved his kids. His kids were everything to him.\" His two daughters, Allyson and Kaylee, are nurses and struggling to get back to work while they grieve their dad, Helen said. She said now the questions of \"What would he want me to do? What would Corey do?\" help guide her. \"It's definitely a struggle. I realised I always knew he took care of me, but I never realised just how much. I just miss him,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCorey Comperatore was honoured at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July, with his helmet and coat displayed on stage as Trump spoke. Helen said at the July rally, Corey had hoped - and joked - that Trump might call him on stage. The family watched the RNC moment on television, after Trump told Helen about the planned tribute. \"And I just cried because I said he got his moment on stage with Trump,\" she said. \"So, you know, it was kind of like a nice moment, but it was a sad moment at the same time.\"",
    "Nationally an uninsured car is seized by police every three-and-a-half minutes, the Motor Insurance Bureau said\n\nMore than half of the top 15 hotspot areas for uninsured drivers are within the West Midlands region, latest figures show. The two worst offending postcodes were B11 and B21 in Birmingham, and WV2 in Wolverhampton was in fourth place, according to claims data from the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB). West Midlands Police seized more than 6,500 uninsured vehicles last year, Paul Farley from the MIB said. \"It is a challenge, the police are doing lots of work and we're really trying to make a difference,\" he said.\n\nB18, B8 and B33 in Birmingham also featured on the list, along with WS4 in Walsall and CV7, which covers parts of Solihull and Warwickshire. Historically, London has been on the list, but has not appeared for the past two years, Mr Farley said.\n\n\"We tend to find in metropolitan city areas such as Birmingham and the Black Country we do experience higher crime levels, these are linked to uninsured driving and there are some socio-economic factors also play into this as well,\" Mr Farley said. \"When we see uninsured drivers in one particular area, it means then that local road users are more at risk, which is why we're collaborating very closely with West Midlands Police to tackle the problem.\" Working with the police, Mr Farley said they were trying to \"bear down\" on the \"small proportion of the motoring population that drive intentionally without any insurance, sometimes with no MOT or tax\". \"Please do not drive if you're uninsured,\" he added. \"You could really affect yourself in the future and other motoring members of the public too.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Wolverhampton",
    "British national and several Turkish citizens abducted in Kenya\n\nNecdet Seyito\u011flu lived in the UK for 18 years before moving to Kenya\n\nA British national has told the BBC that he and several Turkish citizens were abducted in the Kenyan capital Nairobi by masked men on Friday, with four of the Turkish citizens still missing. Necdet Seyito\u011flu, who lived in the UK for 18 years before moving to Kenya two years ago, said he was released after eight hours when he showed his alleged abductors a copy of his British passport. In a statement, the UK Foreign Office said they were \"providing consular support to a British man and his family following an incident in Kenya\". Kenyan police told the BBC they were investigating a \"kidnapping incident\" after a motorcycle driver witnessed the abduction.\n\nAccording to the report, two vehicles intercepted and blocked from the front and behind a silver saloon car with two occupants. \"About eight persons armed with weapons emerged from the two vehicles, pulled out the two occupants\" and drove off with them, said Kenyan police spokeswoman Resila Onyango. \"Later, one Yusuf Kar, a British national of Turkish origin\" reported to a nearby police station and identified the kidnapped men as H\u00fcseyin Ye\u015filsu and Necdet Seyito\u011flu. Turkish authorities have not yet commented on the incident. Mr Seyito\u011flu, an education consultant, gave additional details of what he said happened during his kidnapping ordeal, some of which differ from the police account. He described a white SUV intercepting his car as he was leaving home for work with a friend at 07:30 local time (04:30 GMT). The pair were blindfolded and handcuffed by four armed men before being driven off to an unknown location, he said. Repeated requests about what was happening went unanswered, he said. \"We asked them, can you show your identification? Where we are going? But we didn't get any kind of explanation,\" the 49-year-old said. \"It was the worst experience of my life,\" Mr Seyito\u011flu added.\n\nHe said he was eventually able to convince his alleged abductors that he was a British citizen by showing them a copy of his passport on this phone. After taking a photo, the men received a call that sounded like it was an instruction to release him, he said. The masked men, who Mr Seyito\u011flu said spoke Swahili, then dropped him off at a place he did not recognise and gave him 1,000 shillings ($7.50; \u00a36) for transport back home, but refused to return his phone and laptop. During this time, Mr Seyito\u011flu said his wife reported him missing, and informed the British High Commission. Mr Seyito\u011flu said six other people he knew - all Turkish citizens - were also abducted in the same manner from different locations in Nairobi. A local law firm, Mukele & Kakai, said in a statement that it was acting on behalf of four men who were registered refugees and warned airlines against allowing them to be brought on board. \"Our clients were abducted in Kenya with the aim of being deported back to Turkey where they are victims of political victimisation,\" the lawyers' letter, seen by the BBC, said. This was echoed by the campaign group Amnesty International, whose Kenya spokesman said he was \"deeply concerned by reports that seven asylum seekers from T\u00fcrkiye have been abducted on Kenyan soil\". The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, told the BBC it was \"aware of reports and will provide more information once we have it\".",
    "Chris Philp was previously a junior minister in the Home Office\n\nChris Philp has been appointed shadow home secretary by new Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch. The former Home Office minister supported Badenoch's leadership campaign. On Monday it emerged that Badenoch had offered three of her former leadership rivals senior roles. Robert Jenrick, who was beaten in the final round, will serve as shadow justice secretary, while Mel Stride will be shadow chancellor and Dame Priti Patel will be shadow foreign secretary. Badenoch has now named her full shadow cabinet team ahead of their first meeting on Tuesday morning.\n\nEd Argar, a former justice and health minister, has been made shadow health and social care secretary, while Claire Coutinho keeps her job as shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, as well as taking on the shadow equalities brief. Philp was first elected as MP for Croydon South in 2015 and before joining Parliament set up businesses in finance and travel. As well as serving as a junior minister in the Home Office under Rishi Sunak, he has previously held a number of other government roles including briefly serving as chief secretary to the Treasury under Liz Truss. Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet leans heavily on those who supported her leadership campaign. Of the line-up, 15 backed her, five did not declare for either of the final two, and just three backed Jenrick, including Jenrick himself. Some Conservatives are already noting that it is strikingly similar to a line-up Sunak could have selected. Nine of the new shadow cabinet have been at the real cabinet table - perhaps unsurprising for a party which has just been ejected from government but nevertheless a sign that Badenoch has not opted for a radically fresh team. One senior Conservative told the BBC: \"For a party that just had a right vs right leadership contest the almost total absence of the right will not help.\" They warned that right-wing Conservative MPs, who mostly backed Jenrick\u2019s campaign, are now more likely to agitate against Badenoch\u2019s leadership. Badenoch said her new shadow cabinet \"draws on the talents of people from across the Conservative Party, based on meritocracy and with a breadth of experience and perspective\". She added: \"We will now get to work holding Labour to account and rebuilding our party based on Conservative principles and values. \"The process of renewing our great party has now begun.\" By giving jobs to some of her former rivals in the Tory leadership race, as well as figures from different wings of the party, Badenoch will be hoping to unite the Conservatives after they suffered their worst ever general election defeat in July. However, there was wrangling over which, if any, job Jenrick would take. The BBC has been told he turned down several roles before eventually accepting shadow justice secretary. The pair clashed during the final weeks of the leadership contest, with Jenrick accusing Badenoch of being \"disrespectful\" to Tory members by choosing not to set out detailed policies. Badenoch defended her approach, saying she did not want to rush into deciding policies and make promises before she knew how to deliver them. She had hoped to give jobs to all of the former leadership contenders but James Cleverly - who came third in the contest - ruled himself out before the results were announced on Saturday. Tom Tugendhat, who came fourth, is not listed as a member of Badenoch's top team. He is thought to have been offered a role but decided to go to the backbenches.\n\nBadenoch narrowly beat Jenrick to become the new Tory leader\n\nFormer Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott had already been confirmed as shadow education secretary, with Neil O\u2019Brien appointed shadow education minister. Both appeared in their new roles in the House of Commons at Education Questions on Monday. Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves said: \"Instead of turning the page on 14 years of Tory government, Kemi Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet shows that the Conservatives have learnt nothing. \"How can the new Conservative leader claim to be changing the Tory Party when most of her team were ministers for Liz Truss as they crashed Britain\u2019s economy, or claim to want to uphold standards when most went AWOL for the vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s antics at Partygate?\" The Liberal Democrats branded the appointments a \"cabinet of contradictions\" and \"a recipe for yet more Conservative chaos\". The party's Cabinet Office spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"How can they claim to be able to hold this new government to account when they have just as many disagreements with each other?\"",

Dolly Parton sings 'Helene' as she pledges $1m in hurricane relief\n\nMusic icon Dolly Parton has announced she will make a personal donation of $1m (\u00a3762,000) towards disaster recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Speaking at an event in her home state of Tennessee on Friday, the 78-year-old said the money would come \"from my own bank account\". Parton's local commercial ventures - including the Dollywood amusement park - would also donate the same amount to the Mountain Ways Foundation, which is aiding those affected by flooding in the region. During her remarks, Parton broke into song, singing \"Helene, Helene\" to the tune of her 1973 hit Jolene. At least 225 people have died due to Helene, which tore through the south-east US in late September.\n\nHelene is the deadliest mainland storm since Katrina in 2005. Making landfall as a category four hurricane, Helene damaged structures, caused flash flooding and knocked out power to millions of homes. Over half a million properties remain without electricity as of Saturday. The US government has said the clean-up effort could take years. While a large proportion of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, others have been recorded in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. \"This is my home,\" Parton said at Friday's news conference, which took place outside a Walmart store in Newport, Tennessee. \"God has been good to me and so has the public, and I feel that if there's anything I can do to give back in any way I can I'm always willing to do that. I want to feel like I'm doing my part.\" Explaining that many of her relatives lived in the area, the singer said: \"I was heartbroken like everybody else, and just amazed and devastated by it.\" She added: \"All these people feel like my people.\" Eleven people have so far been confirmed dead in Tennessee due to the storm, according to the latest official tally, external, with more still unaccounted for. At least two factory workers were swept away by floodwaters in Erwin, in the north-east of the state.\n\nHelene damaged structures, caused flash flooding and knocked out power to millions of homes\n\nParton, when asked what her message to victims was, responded: \"I know it's easy for us to say, 'oh, things are going to get better' when things are still really bad.\" \"All we can say is that we are with you, that we love you, we hope that things get better real soon - and we're going to do our part to try and make that possible.\" Coinciding with the news conference, Walmart announced it was increasing its recovery efforts funding to $10m (\u00a37.6m). The supermarket chain's CEO, John Furner, said: \"These aren\u2019t just places where we have stores. These are communities where we work and live.\" He also described Parton as \"a true American legend - and not just for the music, the art, the business, but because of her heart\". The country music singer-songwriter has previously made large donations in response to life-changing events. In 2016, her charity pledged to donate $1,000 a month to families affected by wildfires in Tennessee. And in 2020, she contributed $1m towards the development of one of the Covid-19 vaccines.",
    "Donald Trump has announced that he will appoint Karoline Leavitt, his campaign spokeswoman, to serve as White House press secretary in his next administration. At 27, Leavitt will be the youngest White House press secretary in US history. The president-elect said in a statement that he was confident the one-time candidate for Congress - who also served in the White House press office during the first Trump administration - would \"excel at the podium and help deliver our message to the American People as we Make America Great Again\". \"Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,\" Trump said.\n\nA native of New Hampshire, Leavitt studied communications and political science at Saint Anselm College, a Catholic college in her home state. While still in school, she interned at Fox News and in Trump's White House press office. She told Politico in 2020 that she gained her \"first glimpse into the world of press\" through these experiences. They led to her decision to pursue a career in press relations, she said. Leavitt began working for the first Trump White House shortly after graduating in 2019, first as presidential speechwriter and later as assistant press secretary, according to the website for her 2022 run for Congress. \"I helped prepare Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany for high-pressure briefings [and] fought against the biased mainstream media,\" her website stated. After leaving the White House, Leavitt served as the communications director for Elise Stefanik, a senior Republican congresswoman whom President-elect Trump has nominated to serve as United Nations ambassador. Leavitt departed that role to run for Congress, winning the Republican nomination for New Hampshire's first congressional district in 2022, only to lose in the general election to Democrat Chris Pappas. The policy positions she listed on her campaign website largely align with many of Trump's priorities. On the economy, she pledged to \"CUT taxes\" and \"champion pro-growth, free market policies\". She presented herself as a strong backer of law enforcement and strong borders, including \"ZERO tolerance for illegal immigration\" and said she would work to ensure the completion of the border wall. In January 2024, she joined Trump's third bid for the US presidency as his campaign press secretary. Now, she's been chosen to serve as the youngest White House press secretary in US history. Ron Ziegler was the previous record holder. In 1969, he was appointed to the position by Richard Nixon when he was 29. The public will soon see Leavitt in the iconic spot behind the podium in the White House briefing room - a space that led to countless tense exchanges between members of the press and officials in Trump's first administration. Trump ran through multiple press secretaries during his first four-year term, including Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephanie Grisham and Kayleigh McEnany. After departing the White House, Sanders went on to win the race for Arkansas governor. Grisham resigned after the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot and has become a Trump critic. McEnany has continued to advocate for the president-elect as a Fox News personality.",
    "England hang in and earn rewards in the City of Saints\n\nThey call Multan the City of Saints. There were times on the first day of the first Test against Pakistan that England must have hoped for help from the patron saint of taking wickets. An inexperienced attack, the most docile pitch, sun burning hot enough to make statues sweat and a Pakistan captain determined to make up for 10 consecutive winless home matches. This was as tough as it gets. Still, England stood up. Despite skipper Shan Masood plundering 151, supported by Abdullah Shafique\u2019s 102, the tourists stuck at it. As the light faded and the second new ball shone, the gift of Babar Azam plonking his pad in front of the stumps was nothing more than England deserved. At 328-4, Pakistan had the better of the day, but England\u2019s smiles and high fives as they made their way to the dressing room showed they have taken something from it. A good start to day two and they will be right in the match. There was a temptation to think that England could simply pick up where they left off here two years ago, when a 3-0 series win was perhaps the greatest ever in a foreign country not called Australia or India. It was certainly the peak of the Bazball era to date.\n\nBut there is plenty different to 2022. Despite their wretched run, Pakistan look stronger on paper than they did then. A subtle change is the time the series is being played. December then to October now doesn\u2019t sound much, but the elevation in temperature is uncomfortable. The biggest difference is the make-up of England\u2019s pace attack. Gone are the retired James Anderson (more on him later), the injured Mark Wood and Ollie Robinson has been sent to Coventry. In their place have come the notoriously travel-sick Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, a summer revelation but untried away from home, and Brydon Carse, untried anywhere and only just off completing a ban for historic gambling offences. It was the seamers who were key to England\u2019s previous success here. Whereas in 2022 the spinners largely matched each other \u2013 England\u2019s took 33 wickets at an average of 37.3, Pakistan\u2019s 35 wickets at 36.2 \u2013 the touring seamers comfortably out-bowled the hosts. England claimed 26 victims at 23.3, Pakistan just 11 at a whopping 62.7. Some help from the toss would have been appreciated, but Ollie Pope has now lost four out of four standing-in for injured England skipper Ben Stokes. If England were looking for assistance from the pitch, they were left disappointed. Pre-match talk of grass was dashed by a mower on Monday morning. A penny for the thoughts of Saim Ayub, who somehow tickled Atkinson\u2019s 10th ball in an away Test down the leg side to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith. He had to watch Shafique and Masood plunder runs from the fourth over of the day until well after tea.\n\nAccording to data analysts Cricviz, the Multan pitch was the second-flattest for day one of a Test anywhere in the world since they started collecting such information in 2007. Across the three sessions, the 0.47 degrees of swing was the least amount of movement in the air for day one in Pakistan since the beginning of 2022. If there was nothing to encourage the seamers, the spinners got little more. The 2.64 degrees of turn was the second-lowest for the opening day in this country over the same time period. Shoaib Bashir struggled \u2013 only once in his short Test career has he bowled more overs without taking a wicket - but Jack Leach impressed in his first Test since January. Despite all of the disadvantages, England hung in. The fielding was never anything but wholehearted, the only error being Pope\u2019s miss at the stumps when Shafique should have been run out on 34. Aside from that, Pope did a fine job at recreating the creativity of Stokes that was crucial to England\u2019s win in 2022. Bowlers were shuffled, fields tinkered. Shafique\u2019s eyeline was flooded with catchers in front of the bat and he eventually popped Atkinson to cover. Left-armer Leach toyed with his angles to come round the wicket to left-hander Masood and was rewarded with a return catch. The only mild criticism was an over-eagerness to bowl bouncers, a favourite tactic of England. Carse, who touched 90mph, was asked to go to the short ball as early as the 15th over of the match. Overall, 40% of the deliveries Carse sent down were bouncers, 61% short of a good length. It is a plan England often revert to for bowlers with extra pace. Jamie Overton bowled 34% bouncers in his only Test against New Zealand in 2022 and Olly Stone 33% in his two Tests against Sri Lanka earlier this year. Wood, albeit faster and more skilful than the other three, is not used as such a blunt instrument. Perhaps the biggest boost for England was the late impact of Woakes. Quiet for most of the day, he grabbed the second new ball to produce a nip-backer that removed Pakistan\u2019s best player in Babar. The UK is on its fifth different prime minister since Woakes\u2019 previous Asian Test wicket in 2016. It was a delivery worthy of Anderson, the absence of whom was made much of in the build-up to the Test. England\u2019s bowling consultant has been playing golf at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. When Anderson does arrive in time for day two, he will join a team that can be optimistic following their first-day showing. In truth, unless England were going to ask Anderson to take the new ball, there seems little he could have passed on to the bowlers that would have made their job any easier. In the City of Saints, England did just fine without Saint Jimmy.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",
    "Lilly Ledbetter is seen here with former US president Barack Obama\n\nLilly Ledbetter, whose name graces an equal pay law in the US, has died aged 86. CBS, the BBC's news partner in the US, quoted her children as saying she died peacefully on Saturday surrounded by family and loved ones. Ms Ledbetter's activism led to the first bill signed into law by Barack Obama after he became US president in 2009.\n\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act made it easier for workers to sue after discovering they were being discriminated through pay. Mr Obama said that the law sent the message \"that there are no second-class citizens in our workplaces\". President Biden, who was vice-president during the Obama administration, described Ms Ledbetter as a \"fearless leader and advocate for equal pay\". He paid tribute, saying \"her fight began on the factory floor and reached the Supreme Court and Congress\" and she \"never stopped fighting for all Americans to be paid what they deserve\". \"Before she was a household name, Lilly was like so many other women in the workforce: she worked hard, with dignity, only to find out she was being paid less than a man for the same work.\" Biden added it was \"an honour to stand with Lilly as the bill that bears her name was made law\", describing the Fair Pay Restoration Act as a \"critical step forward in the fight to close the gender and racial wage gaps\". Ms Ledbetter worked as a supervisor for Goodyear, the tyre manufacturer, in Alabama for nearly 20 years before discovering she was being paid less than men doing the same job. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had no grounds to sue because her complaint had not been lodged within six months of the discrimination first taking place. Her law overturned that ruling. The former president paid tribute on Twitter/X, saying Ms Ledbetter \"never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work\". \"Lilly did what so many Americans before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even higher for her children and grandchildren,\" Mr Obama said. Ms Ledbetter continued her advocacy after the law was signed. She received the Future Is Female Lifetime Achievement Award from Advertising Week last week, according to the Alabama news site AL.com. A new film about her life, called Lilly and starring Patricia Clarkson, has recently been shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",

Mayer took Ryan's WBO welterweight title via a majority decision on Friday. Before the bout, the 31-year-old from Derby was had red paint thrown over her as she made her way from her hotel to The Theater inside Madison Square Garden. On Monday, Ryan said she had also been threatened and subjected to a \"disgusting and pathetic smear campaign\" on fight day. She claimed that \"defamatory\" leaflets were distributed before and after the fight, that her team received threatening messages and that she was advised to leave New York \"for her own safety\". After her victory, Mayer, 34, said she was \"shocked\" to hear about the paint incident and that it had nothing to do with her or her team. \"In light of everything that\u2019s happened, I believe that an immediate rematch should be ordered,\" Ryan posted on social media on Monday. \"I felt the fight itself was close but I thought I did enough to retain my title. ESPN had me winning by two rounds and I know many other respected boxing observers also had me winning the fight.\" Two of the scorecards read 97-93 and 96-94 for Mayer, while a third judge saw it a 95-95 draw. The pair have known each other since their amateur days but have become involved in a bitter feud over training arrangements after Ryan relocated to Mayer\u2019s gym in the United States. They were involved in a fiery news conference on the eve of the fight.\n\nOn Saturday, Ryan said she \"shouldn\u2019t have fought\" after the paint incident but now insists pulling out of the bout was never an option. She also said the New York Police Department (NYPD) have told her they are investigating the incidents but the NYPD would not confirm this when approached by BBC Sport. \"I\u2019ve too much pride and have worked too hard to let incidents as pathetic as these force me out of a fight \u2013 especially when that fight gave me the opportunity to fulfil a dream of headlining a card at Madison Square Garden live on ESPN,\" Ryan said. \"I have dedicated my life to this sport and am very grateful for the opportunities it has given me.

    "Dozens of people descended on a Chicago park on Saturday, vying to be crowned best Jeremy Allen White lookalike. Contestants \u2013 including a toddler \u2013 donned chef\u2019s aprons and white t-shirts in the style of White\u2019s character Carmen Berzatto from the hit TV series The Bear. Others dressed as his character Phillip in Shameless, another TV show set in Chicago. Hundreds of spectators cheered as each contender stepped forward to show their resemblance. Based on levels of applause, the accolade went to a 37-year-old mental health therapist, Ben Shabad.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really plan on winning \u2013 especially when I saw all these guys that looked like Jeremy Allen White \u2013 but the energy here is so exciting,\u201d Mr Shabad told the Chicago Tribune. As a prize, Mr Shabad received $50 and a pack of cigarettes \u2013 a nod to Berzatto\u2019s heavy smoking in the series. The show, now in its third season, follows a young chef from the fine dining world, Carmy, as he returns to the family-run sandwich shop in Chicago after his brother's suicide. The show won six prizes, including three for acting, at the 2024 Emmy Awards, drawing with Succession for the most accolades. The lookalike competition was organised by Chicago roommates Kelsey Cassaro and Taylor Vaske. The pair were inspired by the success of similar events in recent weeks for other celebrities including Dev Patel and Paul Mescal. In October, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stunned fans after turning up to a lookalike competition for the actor in New York. It appears the celebrity doppelganger craze is not yet over, with Saturday's event just the latest in a string of competitions across the country.\n\n\u201cPeople were online saying, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Chicago have one?\u2019 said Ms Cassaro, speaking with the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cI was like, \u2018I think it should be Jeremy Allen White if we do it.\u2019 And I also think a lot of Chicago dudes look like him,\u201d she added. Cassaro and Vaske originally planned the event as a joke, posting details on social media and flyers in areas of Chicago. Once buzz picked up online about it, they decided to organise it officially. Unlike Chalamet, White did not show up to the competition. But that didn\u2019t dampen his doppelgangers' spirits. \u201cI\u2019m just impressed by [White\u2019s] acting ability, and the shows that he\u2019s been in have been really good, so I take it as a compliment that people think I look like him,\u201d said Mr Shabad.",

    "China's giant sinkholes are a tourist hit - but ancient forests inside are at risk\n\nSinkholes in China's Guangxi province have become a tourist attraction\n\nThe couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff. More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs. For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored. People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths. But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.\n\nRui and Michael ahead of their trek into the sinkhole\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air. Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge. He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes. Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.\n\nThis is the only way into a sinkhole...\n\nBut once you reach the bottom, a forest awaits\n\nEventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child. \u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were. \u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.\n\nBrother Fei, now a veteran sinkhole guide, avoided the caves as a child\n\nSinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground. Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide. For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails. Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.\n\nThere is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down. This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave. After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock. That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position. \u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave. This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d\n\nThe tourists descend further into the cave\n\nVideos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty. There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult. Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note. Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing. Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d\n\nBut there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research. About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d. \u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.\n\nThe viewing platform in Dashiwei claims to be the world's highest\n\n\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance. \u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d. As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us. Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole. \u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him. He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave.",
    "Migrant took own life after 'multiple failings' at UK detention centre\n\nFrank Ospina took his own life in immigration detention\n\nAn inquest jury has found \"multiple failings\" and \"missed opportunities\" at an immigration detention centre contributed to a Colombian man taking his own life in 2023. The coroner examining the death of Frank Ospina said he had been let down by the state \"in numerous ways\" which were \"utterly regretful\". Last year the BBC revealed Frank Ospina had died in the detention removal facility despite being willing to return home to Colombia. The jury found his case should have been reviewed because of his worsening mental health, which could have led to him being released. Offering its condolences, the Home Office said steps had been taken since Mr Ospina's death to improve safeguards for individuals in detention.\n\nFrank Ospina, 39, an engineering graduate, came to the UK in late 2022 to visit his mother, who had settled here, and to visit prospective universities. Having decided to instead enrol on a master's course in Spain, which was due to begin in May 2023, he took a short-term job washing dishes, his family say. But as a foreign national Mr Ospina did not have the right to work in the UK. He was arrested in an immigration raid and taken to the Heathrow detention centres. Behind bars he suffered a mental health crisis and on 26 March 2023 was found dead at the Harmondsworth facility, having strangled himself. The inquest jury concluded that he had killed himself.\n\nFrank Ospina suffered a mental health crisis while detained and awaiting removal from the UK\n\nThe jury's key finding centred on a detention centre rule that medical staff should report any detainee suspected of having suicidal intentions. The failure to submit a rule 35.2 report meant Frank Ospina's release from detention was never considered by the Home Office, the jury concluded. His mother visited him but was separated from him by a glass wall which the jury described as \"inappropriate and unnecessary\". It \"contributed to the deterioration of his mental health and incurred further stress\", the jury decided. Staff on duty that night made \"unacceptably inadequate observations\" of Frank Ospina, failing to spot he was not in his bed. He was found out of sight, having strangled himself.\n\nThe Coroner, Lydia Brown, offered her condolences to his family telling the court \"the state took Frank Ospina into detention and this jury found they let him down in numerous ways and of course his family down that is utterly regretful and now irretrievable.\"\n\nFrank Ospina was detained at Harmondsworth alongside failed asylum seekers and former foreign criminals. He told a charity he was prepared to be removed from the UK under a voluntary return scheme and was not trying to avoid deportation. His brother-in-law, Julian Llano, told the BBC: \"He kept insisting that he felt very bad, mentally, that he needed to get out of there. \"He didn't ask for help - he begged for help, not only to us, but also to the people there.\"\n\nHarmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre is Europe's largest detention facility and can hold up to 676 men.\n\nImmigration detention centres are run like prisons, but many of those detained have committed no crime. They are held while the authorities prepare for them to be removed from the UK. The Ospina case highlighted ongoing concerns about the management of immigration centres, six years after a BBC investigation revealed the abuse of detainees at Brook House near Gatwick. The chair of a public inquiry into that scandal said in September only one of her 33 recommended changes had been carried out by the government. Yet the centres are under growing pressure because the government is planning to remove more failed asylum seekers as part of a plan to reduce small boat crossings.\n\nA spokesperson for Mitie, which runs the Harmondsworth facility, said \"the physical and mental wellbeing of those in our care is of the utmost importance to us\". \"We accept that the decision to place Mr Ospina\u2019s family in a closed room for their visit was wrong and not in accordance with our policies and procedures, and we have apologised for this.\" \u201cA number of measures have already been implemented and we will continue working with the Home Office and Practice Plus Group to address the matters raised by the Coroner.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe offer our sincere condolences to Mr Ospina\u2019s loved ones, and since his death in 2023 a number of actions have been taken to improve the safeguards for individuals in detention, including an increase in staffing numbers, training and guidance for staff. \u201cThe new government is focused on ensuring actions are taken to improve conditions in detention facilities, including reviewing the current process for communicating risk and vulnerability of detained individuals. \u201cWe will carefully consider the coroner\u2019s recommendations.\u201d If you or someone you know are feeling emotionally distressed, details of organisations offering advice and support can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",
    "Alex Salmond took part in a panel discussion at the conference in North Macedonia before collapsing during lunch\n\nA man who witnessed Alex Salmond collapse during lunch at an event in North Macedonia has said that \"time stopped\". Youth conference organiser Mark Donfried said Scotland's former first minister was caught by a fellow delegate as he fell backwards in his chair after suffering what is thought to have been a massive heart attack. The event was cancelled as paramedics tried in vain to resuscitate Salmond. A statement from his family paid tribute to a \"formidable politician\" and a \"devoted and loving husband\" following the former SNP leader's death on Saturday at the age of 69.\n\n\"Alex was a formidable politician, an amazing orator, an outstanding intellect, and admired throughout the world,\" the family said in a statement released by The Alba Party. \"He loved meeting people and hearing their stories, and showed incredible kindness to those who needed it. \"He dedicated his adult life to the cause he believed in - independence for Scotland. His vision and enthusiasm for Scotland and the Yes movement were both inspirational and contagious. \"But to us, first and foremost, he was a devoted and loving husband, a fiercely loyal brother, a proud and thoughtful uncle and a faithful and trusted friend.\" Tributes have also poured in from across the political spectrum. Speaking on Sunday morning, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said Salmond \"inspired a generation\" to believe in independence.\n\nSwinney, who served as finance secretary while Salmond was first minister, said he took the party from the fringes of Scottish politics to the heart of government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described Salmond as a \"monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics\", while King Charles paid tribute to his \"devotion to Scotland\" during decades of public service. Floral tributes have been left outside the Scottish Parliament and Salmond's home in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. The former SNP leader was Scotland's first minister between 2007 and 2014, and in recent years led the Alba party. Mr Donfried, executive founder and director at the Academy for Cultural Diplomacy (ACD), said Salmond had been an \"active member\" of his organisation. He told BBC Scotland News: \"For many of the young leaders here he was really a role model and he inspired many of them.\" Speaking from Ohrid in North Macedonia, he said: \"We are all still in a state of shock and that is not something we can easily move forward from.\"\n\nFloral tributes to Salmond have been left outside the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh\n\nMr Donfried said Salmond had delivered a speech at the conference on Friday then attended dinner that evening where he discussed plans for an ACD event in Scotland next year. He said the former MP and MSP had seemed in the \"best of health, the best of spirits\". But the following day during lunch after a panel discussion, Salmond took ill and lost consciousness at the table. Mr Donfried raced to the hotel reception to request an ambulance. He added: \"By the time I came back he was on the floor and they were trying CPR.\" When paramedics arrived there was nothing that could be done to save him. The Interior Ministry of North Macedonia confirmed Salmond passed away at 15:30 local time (14:30 BST).\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMr Donfried said he had been told the cause of death was suspected to be an \"immediate massive heart attack\". \"The good news is he didn't suffer. I don't think he felt any pain.\" Describing the aftermath, he said: \"Really time stopped. The entire hotel, the entire conference was in shock. \"Most of the participants here were young leaders and none of them had ever experienced anything like this. \"I think there was a feeling of shock, a feeling of loss and of not really knowing what to do.\" Those attending the event gathered later to share reflections and give thanks and prayers for Salmond's life.\n\nSalmond pictured at the conference on Friday alongside Alba Party chair Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh\n\nMr Donfried recited a prayer that was shared during his late father's funeral. \"That was important for us all, to have a moment to come together and pause in honour of Alex.\" He added that Salmond, the leader of the Alba party, was \"a great leader who inspired so many\". Mr Donfried said: \"I was speaking to some of the Spanish participants last night and they were talking about how in Spain he is, in so many ways, a legend.\" He said ACD, which is based in Berlin, had received many messages from across the world since Salmond's sudden death. Mr Donfried said the organisation was in close contact with the British Embassy and that the repatriation of Salmond's body may involve the Royal Air Force. He added: \"Our hearts are all going out to Alex's family.\"",
    "Children in Need chair resigns over grants to scandal-hit LGBT charity\n\nRosie Millard accused Children in Need of \"institutional failure\"\n\nThe chair of the BBC's Children in Need charity has resigned, after reports that she protested over grants awarded to an LGBT youth charity, whose former chief had previously been involved in a child abuse scandal. Rosie Millard, a writer and broadcaster, accused the charity of \"institutional failure\" in her letter of resignation shared with the Times., external Millard objected to \u00a3466,000 being awarded to LGBT Youth Scotland (LGBTYS) , a charity which supports young gay and transgender people. Its former chief James Rennie was convicted in 2009 of child sex assaults. The grants from Children In Need began seven months later, when the charity had new management in place.\n\nBBC News has not seen Millard's resignation letter. A Children in Need spokesman said: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of all children and young people. \"When allegations were made in relation to LGBT Youth Scotland their grant was immediately suspended with the full support of the board and a review began. In order to do this thoroughly and fairly the review took three months and culminated in the decision to withdraw funding.\" Rennie, who had been chief executive of LGBTYS from 2003 to 2008 and is also a previous SNP adviser, was jailed in 2009 after being revealed as a member of a paedophile ring. He was given a life sentence for sexually assaulting a three-month-old child and for conspiring to get access to children in order to abuse them. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 13 years, later reduced to eight on appeal. Rennie's crimes were found to have had no relation to or impact on the charity and were only uncovered by a police investigation. LGBTYS cut ties with him immediately and have said they \"condemn any actions which harm children and young people\". Children in Need suspended grants to the charity in May 2024, after Millard says she alerted them to his case. It withdrew funding around three months later following a review. However, Millard, who used to be an arts correspondent for BBC News, criticised Children in Need for what she said was a lack of due diligence. She accused chief executive Simon Antrobus of failing to respond \u201cwith the necessary level of seriousness\u201d and hesitating to take action. She alleged that he eventually cut funding to the charity only because of fear of negative publicity. Antrobus, who has been chief executive of Children In Need since 2016 and previously held senior positions at Parkinson's UK and Scope, has not publicly commented.\n\nAnother man, who contributed to schools guidance put together by LGBT Youth Scotland, was convicted this year of sharing indecent images of children including some of newborn babies. Andrew Easton was a young person who attended services of LGBT Youth Scotland in the 2000s, and, as a result, contributed to a 2010 guide for young people about coming out. However, he was never an employee of the charity. He pleaded guilty in September to \u00adcommunicating online with someone he believed to be a child, downloading indecent images of children and distributing indecent images of children. He was sentenced to a community order, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, put on the sex offenders register for three years and told to take part in a sex offenders programme. In 2022, two men said that they were groomed at LGBTYS around the time Rennie was chief executive. In response, LGBTYS suspended a staff member and referred itself to the police. A Children in Need spokesman said: \"The Children in Need board of trustees are supportive of the actions taken by the CEO and senior leadership team and stand by the decisions made. \"Rosie at all times retained the board\u2019s support. In the wake of her resignation, in order to ensure any lessons learnt are captured, the trustees have instigated a review of ways of working between the board and executive in which Rosie has kindly agreed to participate.\u201d\n\nMhairi Crawford, chief executive of LGBTYS, said that Millard\u2019s resignation letter \u201cdemonstrates the ideologically driven nature of her attacks on our organisation\u201d. Crawford said: \u201cWe are pleased to see confirmation that Children in Need\u2019s investigations into the work of LGBT Youth Scotland found nothing to report. \u201cTime and time again, those with anti-inclusivity motives point to historic allegations in attempts to destroy our reputation. Allegations that have been investigated and cleared by Police Scotland, and proven to have had no link to our work.\u201d Speaking to BBC News on Thursday Crawford added she was \"really gutted\" to have lost funding from Children in Need. \"We worked with them [Children in Need] for the best part of 15 years, and it's really sad to see a funder choosing to take that line,\" she said. \"I understand why they've done it, and I respect it, but it's really sad that it happened, and really disappointing how it reached the press and how it communicated publicly.\" Tim Davie, the BBC's director general, praised Millard on Wednesday for her \u201csignificant impact on countless children\u201d. Children in Need raised more than \u00a339 million in its annual broadcast on Friday.",
    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. We must change the way we measure debt, says Rachel Reeves\n\nThe government will change its self-imposed debt rules in order to free up billions for infrastructure spending, the chancellor has told the BBC. Rachel Reeves said that she would make a technical change to the way debt is measured which will allow it to fund extra investment. She said this was being done \"so that we can grow our economy and bring jobs and growth to Britain\". However, Reeves' first Budget next week is still expected to mean some cuts to public services and tax rises.\n\nThe government has committed to get debt falling as share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, rather than over a rolling five-year period. But the wider debt measure is expected to allow for up to \u00a350bn more borrowing to invest in big building projects such as roads, railways or hospitals, although not all of this is expected to be allocated at the Budget. \"We will be changing the measure of debt,\" Reeves told the BBC, adding that she will set out the details of that on 30 October. She said the Treasury would \"be putting in guard rails\" on investment spending by having the National Audit Office and the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's financial watchdog, \"validating the investments we're making to ensure we deliver that value-for-money\".\n\nReeves added having such oversight would also \"give markets confidence that there are rules around the investments we can make as a country\". But shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the \"consistent advice I received from Treasury officials was always that increasing borrowing meant interest rates would be higher for longer - and punish families with mortgages\". \"The markets are watching,\" he added. However, a Labour spokesperson said the party \"will not take any lectures from the Tories on how to run the economy\" citing former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget which caused market turmoil. The extra room for manoeuvre for spending on investment projects will not be able to be used for extra day-to-day spending, as Reeves has committed to fund that with tax receipts. This means planned taxes will go ahead in the Budget. Speculation is growing over what taxes will be raised next week, with Labour's election manifesto stating the party would not increase taxes on \"working people\", including National Insurance, income tax and VAT. The chancellor has signalled that businesses face an increase in National Insurance, saying the \"working people\" pledge related to the employee element of the tax, as opposed to the sum paid by employers. There has been lack of clarity over how the government defines \"working people\". Later on Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he did not consider someone who works but gets their income from assets as well, such as shares or property, to be a working person. \"They wouldn't come within my definition,\" he said. He separately told reporters a working person is someone who \"works for a living and through that gets their income\". Acknowledging this was a \"very broad\" definition, he elaborated he had in mind someone who earns a living and has savings but who doesn't \"have the ability to sort of routinely write a big cheque if they get into difficulties\".\n\nEarlier Reeves told the BBC it was important for the government to \"get a grip on day-to-day spending\" by making sure it was paid for through tax receipts and by reforming public services to make them more productive. The chancellor said she will commit to a tighter financial rule requiring all day-to-day spending to be funded via tax receipts. That rule \"is the one that really binds, and it's hard to meet, and that will require difficult decisions on spending, welfare and taxation,\" she said. The chancellor said she intended to reverse what she called \"the path of decline\" that she says she has inherited from the previous Conservative administration. She suggested this would have seen a fall in government investment from 2.6% of the share of the economy last year to 1.7% by 2028-29, or \u00a320bn a year in cash terms. \"If we continued on that path, we'd miss out on other opportunities, and other countries would seize them,\" she said. \"We need to invest more to grow our economy and seize the huge opportunities there are in digital, in tech, in life sciences, in clean energy, but we'll only be able to do that if we change the way that we we measure debt,\" she said at a meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC. Sir Keir told the BBC the change to the debt rules showed the \"mindset of the new government\". \"We're going to clear the decks,\u201d he said. \"If you know what the problem is, what the challenge is, every business knows this, every family knows it, run towards it and fix it.\" The Treasury had already signalled that a rule change was likely ahead of the Budget. The chancellor cited top economists as backing the move, including both the former governor and chief economist of the Bank of England, Mark Carney and Andrew Haldane, as well as former Conservative Treasury minister Jim O\u2019Neill. She also referred to the words of a top IMF official overnight. The organisation's first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath backed greater investment, speaking to the BBC: \"I just want to emphasize again, that public investment is needed in the UK. \"If you compare the UK to G7 countries, investment has fallen short, and so that spending will have to take place alongside having the kind of rules that stabilizes debt over the next five years.\" But writing in The Times newspaper last week, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said that using a broader debt measure called public sector net financial liabilities could have downsides, including potentially spooking financial markets, which fund the government's borrowing.\n\nWhat do you want to see in the Budget, how do you think it will affect you personally and what would you like us to explain?",

    "Cyclists on phones face jail under Japan\u2019s new laws\n\nThe number of cyclists in Japan surged during the pandemic, and authorities are now racing to regulate them.\n\nCyclists using a mobile phone while riding in Japan could face up to six months jail under strict new rules introduced Friday. Those who breach the revised road traffic law can be punished with a maximum sentence of six months in prison, or a fine of 100,000 yen ($655; \u00a3508). The number of accidents involving cyclists started climbing in 2021, as more people opted to cycle instead of using public transport during the pandemic, according to local media. Authorities are now racing to regulate riders. Besides cracking down on phone usage, the new rules also target cyclists riding under the influence of alcohol, with a penalty of up to three years in prison or a fine of 500,000 yen ($3,278; \u00a32,541).\n\nHours after the new laws came into effect, Osaka authorities confirmed on Friday that they had already recorded five violations, including two men who were caught riding bicycles while drunk. One of the men had collided with another cyclist, but no injuries were reported. Under the new rules, cyclists who cause accidents can be fined up to 300,000 yen ($2,000; \u00a31,500 ) or jailed up to a year. The total number of traffic accidents across Japan may be declining, but bicycle accidents are on the rise. More than 72,000 bicycle accidents were recorded in Japan in 2023, accounting for over 20% of all traffic accidents in the country, according to local media. In the first half of 2024 there was one fatality and 17 serious injuries from accidents involving cyclists using their phones \u2014 the highest number since the police started recording such statistics in 2007. Between 2018 and 2022 there were 454 accidents caused by cyclists using phones, according to police \u2014 a 50% increase from the previous five-year period. The latest rules come amid a series of safety regulations aimed at protecting the safety of riders and pedestrians. Last year, authorities made it compulsory for cyclists to wear helmets. In May, Japan\u2019s parliament passed a bill allowing police to fine cyclists for traffic violations. Unlike in many other countries, cycling on pavements is legal in Japan, and is a common practice.",
    "A poignant memorial to polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton from his crew has gone on display in Dundee after a journey of more than 7,000 miles from the South Atlantic. Shackleton died in 1922 in South Georgia during his final expedition. The Hope Cross was constructed by crew members who could not attend his funeral. The 3m (9.84ft) memorial is now on display beside RRS Discovery, the ship which first took Shackleton to Antarctica in 1901. Its unveiling coincides with the release of a new documentary on Shackleton's doomed Endurance expedition and the 2022 hunt for the sunken vessel.\n\nThe crew of The Quest pictured with the cross the month after Shackleton's death in 1922\n\nThe wooden cross stood for almost 100 years at King Edward Point, South Georgia, near Grytviken, before it was replaced with a replica in 2018 to preserve the original memorial from the elements. The original cross weighs about 30kg (66lb) and was made with salvaged wood from a whaling station. It was painted white to protect the wood, but decades of Antarctic weather have returned it to its natural state.\n\nShackleton's granddaughter Alexandra said she was \"delighted\" to see the cross in its new home\n\nDundee Heritage Trust heritage manager Sophie Hinde said: \"The Quest crew members had to leave Ernest behind when he passed away to continue on the rest of the expedition. \"There were thoughts that his body would be taken to England for a funeral, but it was actually buried in Grytviken and the crew put up the cross because they wanted him to be memorialized.\"\n\nThe cross was stored in a crate ahead of its journey to Dundee\n\nIts remote location meant few people were previously able to visit the memorial. \"If you wanted to go down to South Georgia, the only way to do it is on a cruise ship. There aren't that many, and the season is quite short,\" said Ms Hinde \"We were approached by the South Georgia Heritage Trust, who had the cross in a warehouse after it was taken down in 2018 for conservation reasons. \"They just wanted to give people the space to see it.\" The cross was taken on a three-month journey on the RRS David Attenborough from Grytviken to Harwich, before being briefly stored at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. Ms Hinde said: \"Then we went down in a van and collected it, so it's been quite a journey. \"It was actually in a very good condition.\"\n\nThe cross stood at King Edward Point, South Georgia, for almost a century\n\nInterest in Shackleton's adventures remains high more than a century after his death. Ms Hinde said: \"I think a lot of people appreciate his spirit of adventure. \"He's probably best known for his Endurance expedition, where he rescued his crew after their ship had sunk in the Antarctic winter. \"His leadership is a thing that people come back to again and again - the adventures that he went on are incredible.\"\n\nSir Ernest Shackleton died on board his ship The Quest in January 1922\n\nErnest Shackleton was born in County Kildare, Ireland, in 1874. In 1901, alongside explorer Robert Falcon Scott, he got closer to the South Pole than any other European explorer. Shackleton's most famous mission was his plan to cross the South Pole on board his ship The Endurance. In 1915, the boat became trapped in ice, and his crew abandoned ship, crossing onto floating ice, where they decided they were going to live until they could be saved. In April 1916, Shackleton took five crew members in a small boat in search of help for the others, where they travelled 807 miles (1,300km) of ocean before reaching the island of South Georgia. The last voyage Ernest Shackleton took was on board the Quest in 1922. He had planned to explore Alaska and islands nearby, but lost his funding. Instead, he headed to the South Pole to explore islands around Antarctica but died of a heart attack on board the ship, aged 47.\n\nSophie Hinde said very few people had previously seen the cross in person, due to its remote location.\n\nThe Hope Cross is on long-term loan from the South Georgia Museum. Ms Hinde said: \"Antarctica from 1901 to 1904 is the main expedition that we talk about here. \"But actually, the early age of Antarctic exploration ran right until this last expedition, the Quest in 1922, so it rounds off the stories that we tell her quite nicely.\" Shackleton\u2019s granddaughter Alexandra will attend a private rededication ceremony to the cross later. She said: \u201cI am absolutely delighted to see the cross here in a city that my grandfather knew so well. \"Our family is very grateful to all who have made this possible.\u201d",
    "'This town is where goths feel safe and accepted'\n\nWhitby was chosen as the festival's host town due to its association with Dracula\n\nThirty years since the seaside town hosted its first Goth Weekend, Whitby is still a \"safe and accepting\" place, say regular visitors to the festival. Held annually in April and October, the gothic gathering began in 1994 and now attracts large crowds to Whitby's cobbled streets. Inspired by the town's association with Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, it started out as a one-off meeting of pen-friends in The Elsinore pub. This year\u2019s celebrations will take place from 1 November and include live music and stalls, with a 30th birthday party planned for 3 November.\n\nElaine Horton, owner of goth shop Pandemonium, said her business would not exist without the boost in trade from the two weekends. Her alternative store sells clothing, shoes, babywear, hair accessories, jewellery and gifts and first opened in 1999. Ms Horton said there was a large variation within the subculture. \"Believe it or not there are probably around 35 types of goth,\" she said. \"There are a lot of people who come into Whitby just for the architecture, they come to Goth Weekend because they like the clothing, they like the music, some people like all of it,\" she added.\n\nThe Sophie Lancaster Foundation said Whitby felt like a \u201csecond home\u201d\n\nMembers of The Sophie Lancaster Foundation charity have been attending Whitby Goth Weekend since the 20-year-old was killed in 2007. She died after a group of boys attacked her and her boyfriend in a park in Lancashire while they were dressed in gothic clothing. Two of them were convicted of murder. The foundation has a stall at the festival to raise money for its work, educate people and keep her memory alive. Elloise Dickinson, education and engagement manager, said the event was a \u201cspecial place for the foundation\u201d. \u201cThe Whitby goths have always been there for us,\" she said. \u201cWe meet people who would see Sophie in Manchester or know people who knew her and even those who don\u2019t come up and say: \u2018We resonate with her story.\u2019 \u201d Ms Dickinson said the town felt like a \u201csecond home\u201d for the foundation. \u201cOur heart is there,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a place like Whitby there\u2019s so much support. \u201cThe festival gives a chance for alternative people to come out in finery and express themselves and feel safe. \u201cIt\u2019s important for others to see alternative people look so amazing in a way they feel comfortable. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people as old as 80 or 90 but also children as young as four or five who are just getting into it. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to celebrate difference in culture and celebrate diversity.\u201d\n\n\"Dr Crank\", who runs Whitby Walks, says the weekend had become a \"worldwide event\"\n\n\"Dr Crank\", who runs ghost walks, said he had watched the goth festival grow into a \"worldwide event\". \u201cThe reason the goths like to come to Whitby, especially this time of the year, is it\u2019s atmospheric,\" he said. Dr Crank, who also holds Halloween walks and a Dracula-themed tour, added: \u201cYou get goths from all over the world coming to Whitby, we welcome them all. \u201cWhitby\u2019s a very accepting town and every year they bring colour \u2013 mainly black or purple.\"\n\nThe festival is held twice a year and welcomes visitors from around the world\n\nMerryn Wilderspin, an artist and designer from Malton, has created two Whitby Goth Weekend collections of her made-to-order designer bags. She said: \u201cI thought Whitby\u2019s goth and steampunk activities could make for interesting themes.\" Despite admitting she \u201ccan\u2019t falsely claim to be a die-hard goth\u201d, she said the weekend had a \u201cfun atmosphere\u201d and she loved being part of it. She said: \u201cGoth is so much to do with fashion and music, which are natural parts of my life. \u201cWith the collections, I thought people would like to have something they can use in an everyday sense that offers a goth flavour without it being too obvious.\u201d\n\nWhitby was chosen for the event because of its association with Dracula",

    "Jacques Billant said some people were rescued from the water but others were likely trampled to death in the boat\n\nFour people, including a two-year-old boy, have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, French authorities say. The authorities said they were found \"unconscious\" and were likely \"trampled to death\" in two separate boats that had engine failures. French interior minister Bruno Retailleau called the deaths a \"terrible tragedy\", adding that people smugglers \"have the blood of these people on their hands\". In one of the incidents, a French rescue service picked up 15 people, including the boy, and one person was airlifted to a French hospital with burns to their legs.\n\nThe prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, Jacques Billant, said one of the boats was off the coast of Boulogne-Sur-Mer in northern France which was carrying \"almost 90 people\" overnight. He said it got into difficulty after an engine failure and called French rescue services. \"A French rescue boat went to the scene and picked up 15 migrants, including an unconscious child. \"The medical team dispatched by helicopter was unable to save the two-year-old child, who was pronounced dead.\" According to the Boulogne-Sur-Mer prosecutor Guirec Le Bras, the young boy, who he said was born in Germany to a Somali mother, was \u201ctrampled to death\u201d. A person on the vessel with burns to their legs was airlifted to hospital, Billant added. The remaining passengers on the boat continued their journey, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nOn a separate overcrowded small boat, another incident happened overnight off the coast of Calais when \u201cmultiple engine failures led to a stampede and some migrants fell into the water but were rescued\u201d, Billant told journalists. \u201cThree people \u2013 two men and a woman \u2013 were then discovered unconscious inside this small boat,\u201d he added. Billant said they were all about 30 years old. \u201cThey were likely trampled to death during the stampede,\" Billant said. A statement by the French coastguard said 71 people were recovered on board, including the three people found unconscious. An investigation has been opened by the Boulogne-sur-Mer public prosecutor's office, the coastguard added. According to French authorities, 51 migrants have lost their lives this year while trying to cross the Channel to reach the UK. \"Our government will intensify the fight against these mafias who are getting rich by organising these crossings of death,\" Retailleau said in a post on X. UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, also posting on X, described the deaths as \"appalling\", adding that \"criminal smuggler gangs continue to organise these dangerous boat crossings\". \"The gangs do not care if people live or die - this is a terrible trade in lives,\" she said. She said she had been in touch with Retailleau on Saturday, and they had met in Italy at the G7 meeting earlier this week, where they had discussed the matter. She previously said that an action plan agreed at that meeting \"means new international joint investigative teams to pursue the gangs, finance and supply chains.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the country's prime minister, Michel Barnier, said France needed a stricter immigration policy. Barnier said he would be \"ruthless\" with people traffickers, adding that they \"exploit misery and despair\" and encourage undocumented asylum seekers to cross the Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously said he was \"absolutely determined\" to tackle the smuggling gangs facilitating the crossings but did not put a timeframe on that. Figures from the Home Office show there were 395 migrants on 4 October who arrived in the UK in small boats without permission to enter the country, and 59 arrived on 29 September. More than 25,000 people have crossed the Channel in 2024 so far. At least 194 migrants died attempting to cross the English Channel between 2018 and September 2024, according to estimates from the International Organization for Migration, which is part of the UN.",
    "Funeral held for toddler who died in Dungannon\n\nTavia Da Costa was due to turn two years old later this month\n\nThe funeral for Tavia Da Costa, who was due to turn two later this month, has taken place in Dungannon after she died at a house in Windmill Court in the town last Sunday. Hundreds attended the service at St Patrick's church in the County Tyrone town. On Saturday evening, a crowd of about 400 people gathered for a candlelit vigil organised by the Lisnahull Residents Group. Three people appeared in court in Belfast on Thursday charged in connection with her death.\n\nThe vigil on Saturday night was organised by the Lisnahull Residents Group\n\nA tin whistle was played at the start of the vigil and prayers were said, members from the East Timor community and local councillors also spoke briefly.\n\nIndependent Mid Ulster councillor Barry Monteith was one of the organisers of the vigil on Saturday. \u201cFor a crowd to turn out like this at such short notice, it shows the real Dungannon and that we\u2019re a community united in grief,\" he said. \u201cThere are people here from far and wide to put their arms round each other and support each other to find away through this.\n\nBarry Monteith said people had attended from \"far and wide\"\n\n\u201cBecause people have just been shocked and horrified after what happened, so it was important to come together tonight.\u201d\n\nRoy Setiawan, chair of the Timorese Association Inclusive Support, said people had attended the vigil to show their support\n\nRoy Setiawan, chair of the Timorese Association Inclusive Support, said the community was \u201cheartbroken\u201d. \u201cAs a community this has really touched us from the Lisnahull Community Association and we appreciate what have they have done, because it feels like everybody\u2019s loss,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to come together tonight commemorate and remember little Tavia, because we\u2019re all feeling the loss, but a lot of people are here to support her and her family.\u201d",
    "Satirical news publication The Onion has bought Infowars, the media organisation headed by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for an undisclosed price at a court-ordered auction. The Onion said that the bid was secured with the backing of families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, who won a $1.5bn (\u00a31.18bn) defamation lawsuit against Jones for spreading false rumours about the massacre. A judge in Texas ordered the auction in September, and various groups \u2013 both Jones\u2019s allies and detractors \u2013 had suggested they would bid for the company. Jones founded Infowars in 1999. He has vowed to continue broadcasting using a different platform.\n\nIn a rambling video message posted on Thursday morning, Jones called the takeover a \u201ctotal attack on free speech\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen but I\u2019m going to be here until they come in and turn the lights off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the tyranny of the New World Order, desperate to silence the American people, the mandate of Trump against all the lawfare \u2013 they don\u2019t care.\u201d The Onion plans to rebuild the website and feature well-known internet humour writers and content creators. \u201cWe are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website,\u201d said Ben Collins, a former NBC News journalist who is chief executive of The Onion\u2019s parent company, in a statement. The website also posted a jokey article, saying that Infowars \u201chas shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society\". The article went on to say that the satirical publication \u201chas outwitted the hapless owner of InfoWars\" and \u201cforced him to sell it at a steep bargain: less than one trillion dollars\". A lawyer for families of eight of the Sandy Hook victims said the bid had their support. \u201cBy divesting Jones of Infowars\u2019 assets, the families and the team at The Onion have done a public service and will meaningfully hinder Jones\u2019 ability to do more harm,\u201d lawyer Chris Mattei said in a statement. Robbie Parker, whose daughter Emilie died in the Sandy Hook attack, said: \u201cThe world needs to see that having a platform does not mean you are above accountability \u2013 the dissolution of Alex Jones\u2019 assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for.\u201d Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control not-for-profit organisation, said it had reached an agreement to advertise on the new site.\n\nJones was a fringe figure broadcasting in Austin, Texas in the 1990s and later built an audience of millions with a mix of opinion, speculation and outright fabrication. The company makes most of its money through an online shop selling vitamins and other products. Over time Infowars was increasingly embraced by Donald Trump\u2019s allies and his supporters. During his first run for president, Trump appeared on Infowars and told Jones: \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d The company\u2019s \u2013 and Jones\u2019s \u2013 financial difficulties stem from broadcasts made after the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Twenty young children and six school staff were killed in the attack. After the killings, Jones and guests on his broadcasts repeatedly called into question whether the massacre actually occurred, floating conspiracy theories about whether the murders were faked or carried out by government agents. At one point Jones called the attack \u201ca giant hoax\u201d and in 2015 he said: \"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured\u2026 I knew they had actors there clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors.\" Believers in the web of conspiracy theories that Jones spun harassed the families of the Sandy Hook victims, in some cases sending them pictures of their dead children or of gravestones and posting their personal information online. Some travelled to Newtown to \u201cinvestigate\u201d, and several people have been arrested in connection with harassment of the victims. Jones later acknowledged that the killings were real and insisted his statements were covered by US free speech protections. But relatives of the victims won defamation judgements against Jones and his company over his false statements. He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones\u2019s personal assets. This included a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns, in all totalling around $8.6m according to a court filing.",
    "Poorer patients missing surgery as they 'can't afford time off work'\n\nChief executive of the Western Trust Neil Guckian said it was a \"sad indictment of our society\"\n\nPatients from poorer backgrounds are missing hospital operations because they can't afford to take time off work, a leading health chief has said. Neil Guckian, chief executive of the Western Trust, described it as \"an indictment on society\". Giving evidence to the Stormont health committee, he said Do Not Attends (DNAs) were a major issue for the health service. People \"are foregoing their operation at the expense of maintaining their livelihood\", according to the chief executive.\n\nMr Guckian said he initially thought patient absence was due to people having to travel for appointments, but having done audits and phoned patients, he was told this was not the reason. \"I believe it is linked to social deprivation. People do not want to admit that they can't take days off work,\" he told the committee. \"That is a sad indictment of our society, so we have to have wraparound support to that.\" Mr Guckian also said that because patients were often waiting so long for a procedure, by the time they are seen their condition had deteriorated. That was one of the issues which the trust was dealing with through \"mega clinic\" sessions, aimed at ensuring patients were dealt with in a quicker way, he said. \"They might be a day case, but they need an in-patient clinic because they have actually deteriorated during the course of their waiting list.\" The chief executives of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts gave an update to the Stormont committee on Thursday. Mr Guckian said the health service could not afford to see industrial action because of the current dispute over pay reviews. He added pay levels for all healthcare workers needed to be addressed as the health service was haemorrhaging staff across the border into hospitals in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster on Friday, chair of the Stormont Health Committee, Liz Kimmins, said that the evidence was deeply concerning. \"We need to understand why this is happening and what can be done to ensure that everyone can attend appointments, taking the time off work for something that is important to their health,\" she stated. \"There needs to be a follow up with patients who don't attend as to why this is the case. \"The Department of Health are working hard to tackle waiting lists but there's more work to be done as there will be other patients on the waiting lists who will happily take their space, even if it is last minute,\" she added.",

    "Republicans have retaken control of the US Senate, after flipping seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana. The results guarantee the Republicans at least 52 out of 100 seats in the new chamber, with a handful of races still undecided. Jim Justice, West Virginia's current governor, won the seat vacated by former Democrat Joe Manchin, while Bernie Moreno in Ohio unseated Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown. In Montana, Democratic veteran Jon Tester lost to Republican Tim Sheehy. In the House of Representatives, Republicans so far are leading - though results are still expected from a number of races.\n\nYou need a modern browser with javascript enabled to view the interactive content in this page.\n\nIf the Republican Party controls the House, Senate and the White House, it would have broad power to pass laws and enact the president's partisan agenda. Republicans last won a majority in the Senate in 2018.\n\nIn Ohio, Brown was projected to lose to Moreno, a Colombian immigrant and former car sales magnate who portrayed the veteran politician as \"too liberal for Ohio\". The contest was called the most expensive Senate race in US history. Brown told supporters that the result was a \"disappointment but not a failure\", adding: \"I'm not giving up on our fight for workers and I know you won't either.\" The seat in West Virginia is projected to flip Republican. It was contested after the retirement of Manchin, who frequently clashed with members of his own party before turning independent. Justice had himself been a Democrat before switching parties to the Republicans at a Trump rally in 2017. In Montana, former Navy seal and businessman Sheehy was projected to defeat 18-year incumbent Tester, who was the last remaining Democrat holding statewide office there. The Republican majority could yet increase further as close races in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada are decided.\n\nJim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, won an open seat away from Democrats\n\nA total of 34 Senate seats were being contested on Tuesday. In Texas, Trump ally Ted Cruz fended off a robust challenge from former NFL player Colin Allred to win a third term. Democrats launched a concerted effort to beat Cruz, but the party has not won a state-wide election in Texas for more than 30 years. Republicans also retained Nebraska's seat for incumbent Deb Fischer, after a surprisingly fierce challenge from auto mechanic Dan Osborn, a registered independent. The Senate result immediately kicked off discussions about who would replace Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader, and therefore become majority leader, in the next legislative session. McConnell, 82, announced earlier this year that he was stepping down from the powerful role.\n\nOne possible candidate is Rick Scott, a Republican incumbent in Florida, who retained his seat despite a challenge by former Miami-area Rep Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who migrated from Ecuador as a child. Speaking at a victory rally early Tuesday evening, Scott correctly predicted that Republicans would seize the majority in the Senate, adding that he would be selected as Senate majority leader. \"Florida is the centre of the Republican Party of this country,\" he told the crowd. \"Washington can learn a hell of a lot from what we've done right here in this great state.\"\n\nDemocrats held a seat in Delaware, a state that President Joe Biden represented as a senator for 36 years, with a victory for fourth-term Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. In Maryland, the Democrats retained a seat vacated by Ben Cardin, with Angela Alsobrooks beating the popular Republican Governor Larry Hogan. They will become the first black female senators to represent their respective states. In New Jersey, Democrats retained a seat that was vacated by Bob Menendez, who resigned after he was found guilty of accepting bribes for political favours. Andy Kim, 42, will become the first ever Korean-American senator. In California, Rep Adam Schiff, who led the first of two impeachment investigations against Trump, retained a seat held by late Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein. Both parties are also vying for control of the House, although the balance of power there will not be known for several days. The vast majority of House elections are happening in \"safe districts\" - regions where one party is nearly certain to win. But a handful of other races in swing districts could determine who controls Washington DC. House races that could swing the balance are taking place a wide variety of states, with closely watched elections happening in California, New York, Washington, Maine and Alaska.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

However, despite Smith's creativity in attack and accuracy from the kicking tee, England are still on their worst run since 2018 after five straight defeats. \"I have found Marcus really open to discussions about the game,\" Strawbridge told BBC Sport. \"He is getting better and better at having a deeper understanding of the game and his role in it.\" Since his Premiership debut for Harlequins as an 18-year-old, regular eye-catching performances left many calling for Smith to be England's long-term option at fly-half. Now capped 38 times, he has started six Tests in a row for the first time since 2022, but five have resulted in defeats - four of which came down to the final play. England's opening try on Saturday against South Africa came when Smith opted against a drop-goal, darted to the blindside and set up Ollie Sleightholme for a run into the corner. Strawbridge says that England's attack allows for such improvisation, and is also confident Smith's game management is improving. \"In some environments I have been in we put all the pressure on the 10 like a quarterback in American Football - they make all the decisions, the calls and the plays. That isn't the case here,\" he added. \"We are spreading the decision-making and we are trying to sharpen that edge. Marcus' decisions are within that structure.\"\n\nStrawbridge joined England's coaching set-up on a full-time basis in April after spending four weeks in the camp as a consultant during the Six Nations\n\nThe last time England lost five straight games was under Eddie Jones, who returns to his former employers on Sunday as Japan boss. Having defeated Jones' side - in their most recent victory by 35 points in June - England go in as heavy favourites to end their miserable run. \"We have had growth this campaign,\" Strawbridge added. \"I get people from the outside finding that hard to believe, but this is a further opptortunity for us consolidate some of our practices in seeing things and executing things. \"This is a step, not a launching pad or a saving grace, in the development of a good, good Test team.\"",
    "Senior doctor 'appalled' at state of new kids' cancer ward - inquiry\n\nA senior doctor has told an inquiry she was \u201cappalled\u201d at the state of child cancer wards when a new \u00a3870m hospital opened in Glasgow in 2015. In evidence presented to the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry, infection control doctor Teresa Inkster said she felt \"something had gone horribly wrong\u201d. Dr Inkster was the lead infection control doctor for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde from April 2016 to September 2019. During that time the children's cancer wards were forced to close because of a spike in unusual infections.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating the construction of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus in Glasgow, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children. It was set up after a number of patient deaths including that of 10-year-old cancer patient Milly Main. Dr Inkster led the investigation into two cases of cryptococcus in 2019, a fungal infection associated with pigeons droppings. Two patients died after contracting the fungal infection while being treated at the hospital. In written evidence to the inquiry, Dr Inkster said on a walk round of the wards at the Royal Hospital for Children in July 2015 she found \u201choles in the ceiling\u201d, \u201cdust falling on her head\u201d with \u201cworkman drilling holes with the most immunocompromised children present\u201d. Dr Inkster said: \u201cIn my view, something had gone horribly wrong\u201d. She told the inquiry there had been issues with water damage, external and ventilation systems being \"poorly managed\". \"People don't understand the need to remove all of the mouldy material, they may just focus on the tile that the water is dripping from, they don't do full inspections of the ceiling void,\" she said. \"The material that is left is a perfect atmosphere for mould to grow.\" There were not \"sufficient accommodations\" for children with compromised immune systems Dr Inkster argued, adding that whole wards could have been \"protective environments\", not just the isolation rooms for the most vulnerable patients. \"I observed myself that it was very difficult for children to be confined to a room for the length of time they needed to be for bone marrow transplant, and I did see patients on occasion being let out of the room and into the corridor,\" she said. \"I can understand why.\"\n\nDr Inkster took over the role of lead infection control doctor after the resignation of her boss Prof Craig Williams in April 2016. In his evidence to the inquiry last month he denied allegations of bullying, saying other doctors had tried to undermine his position. Dr Inkster, however, described working in \u201can environment of suppression and fear\u201d where she was told by Prof Williams not to write things down. She said she and another infection control doctor (ICD), Christine Peters, had expressed concerns about what they were seeing in both the children and adults hospital. But the doctor, who joined the health board's infection prevention and control team as a consultant microbiologist in 2009, said they were not taken seriously. \u201cI felt that myself and Dr Peters were being labelled as difficult and risk averse,\" she wrote in her 391-page evidence submission. \"And that, that was all there was to see here, that it was personality issues rather than any actual genuine concern that there were patient safety issues about the issues we were addressing.\u201d In her statement, Dr Inkster also said by the autumn of 2015 it was \u201cclear that, at this point, there was an awareness by very senior staff that there were issues and there were meetings taking place.\u201d\n\nShe told senior counsel to the inquiry Fred Mackintosh KC that she had asked for water to start being tested at the hospital as early as 2015, but this idea was initially rejected. \"I faced resistance initially with that because, at the time, Health Protection Scotland had released the national pseudomonas [bacterium that can cause infections in multiple parts of the body] guidance and it did not recommend water testing,\" Dr Inkster said. \"It was different from the guidance in NHS England and Wales at the time.\" She pointed out that there were \"structural abnormalities\" in ward drains which allowed stagnation of the water, and nurses had reported \"black muck refluxing from the drains back into the sink\". This had been made worse by fitting filters in the taps. A 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman died after contracting a cryptococcus infection, linked to pigeon droppings, while being treated at the hospital. The inquiry heard that three other patients had tested positive for the infection. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde does not accept that three of the cases are associated with the hospital, nor that there was any causal link between cryptococcus neoformans infections and the presence of pigeon excrement at the hospital. An NHSGGC spokesperson added: \"The current Scottish Hospitals Inquiry hearings have yet to hear from various key staff. \"A number of NHSGGC staff will be able to provide evidence to respond to these issues and will endeavour to support the inquiry to fully establish the facts.\"",
    "Bolt drivers win right to holiday and minimum wage\n\nThousands of drivers working for ride-hailing and food delivery app Bolt have won a legal claim to be classed as workers in the UK rather than self-employed. The ruling means drivers could be entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage, which lawyers said could lead to compensation worth more than \u00a3200m. Bolt said it was reviewing its options, including grounds for appeal. It pointed out that the findings of the Employment Tribunal were confined to drivers who were not on multiple ride-hailing apps.\n\nAbout 15,000 current and former Bolt drivers took legal action against the Estonian-headquartered firm at a London employment tribunal. They argued they were formally workers under British law. Bolt said it had \"always supported\" the \"choice\" of drivers \"to remain self-employed independent contractors\". But the tribunal found that \"overwhelmingly, the power lies with Bolt\". \"There is nothing in the relationship which demands, or even suggests, agency\" on the part of the drivers, it said. The tribunal added that \"the supposed contract between the Bolt driver and the passenger is a fiction designed by Bolt \u2013 and in particular its lawyers \u2013 to defeat the argument that it has an employer/worker relationship with the driver\".\n\u2022 None Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage\n\nThe ruling is the latest on the \"gig-economy\", which is characterised by flexible but unpredictable work patterns. Leigh Day, the law firm representing the claimants, said the judgment confirmed \"gig economy operators cannot continue to falsely classify their workers as independent contractors... to avoid providing the rights those workers are properly entitled to\". It called on Bolt to compensate its clients \"without further delay\". Leigh Day said the ruling \"affects all of the 100,000-plus drivers who take on work through the Bolt private hire hailing app\". But Bolt said the Employee Tribunal's findings were limited to drivers who are not \"multi-apping\". The company said nine in 10 Bolt drivers use multiple apps to connect to customers. The legal case follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2021 that Uber drivers were not self-employed, but were workers entitled to rights including holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and breaks.\n\nThe GMB union said the Bolt ruling \"goes further than the landmark case against Uber\". Uber agreed to recognise the GMB in 2021 following the ruling. The Bolt judgement \"raises questions for the industry around waiting time and multi-apping,\" said Eamon O\u2019Hearn, GMB national officer. \"We believe workers rights around holidays should be universal and this ruling confirms that fact.\" He added the union would \"review the decision closely and engage with the industry to understand the implications for our members\u201d.",
    "Free shots and beer buckets in party town at centre of suspected methanol deaths\n\nHolly Bowles, left, was confirmed to have died on Friday, a day after British lawyer Simone White and Australian Bianca Jones\n\nFor Australian friends Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, it was their first big trip venturing out to explore the world. Like so many 19-year-olds, they were drawn to the romance of backpacking across South East Asia - where food is great, people are friendly and the scenery stunning. They had \u201csaved up enough money after school and university to have their overseas jaunt, as so many of our kids do,\u201d said their football team coach Nick Heath. \u201cAnd off they went.\u201d They ended up on 12 November in the riverside town of Vang Vieng in central Laos. The two checked into the popular Nana Backpacker Hostel - where guests often receive a free shot upon arrival. Days later both were on life support in hospitals in Thailand. Jones\u2019s death was announced on 21 November, and Bowles\u2019s a day later. The death of a British woman, 28-year-old Simone White, was also announced on Thursday. They are among six foreign tourists who have died from what is believed to be a mass incident of methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng.\n\nTwo Danish women, aged 19 and 20, died last week, while an American man also died. They have not been identified. It is unclear how many others have fallen ill, but a transnational police investigation is now underway into the deaths. Much of the scrutiny has fallen on the hostel where some of the victims were reportedly staying. The girls had taken free shots there before heading out for the night. The hostel manager has denied culpability, saying the same drinks had been served to at least 100 other guests that night who reported no problems. The manager was taken in by police for questioning on Thursday. Mr Heath, who spoke to media on behalf of Ms Bowles\u2019s family, said they knew it was methanol that caused the girls to fall ill. But \u201cno one really knows how and where it entered their system\u201d. To understand what happened, the BBC spoke to backpackers and a diplomat about the area. Our reporting found the town where travellers fell ill remains a party hotspot despite past efforts, with some success, to clean up its image, and that while the risk of methanol poisoning is known among consulates and tourism operators, travellers appear largely ignorant.\n\nVang Vieng - a tiny town on the Nam Song river surrounded by limestone mountains and paddy fields - is known for its scenery. It is also known as a party town - a reputation Laos officials have been trying to shed over the past decade. A four-hour bus ride from the capital Vientiane, it has long been the stopping point on the Banana Pancake Trail backpacking route between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam before heading north to the ancient temples of Luang Prabang. In Vang Vieng, hostel bunks are advertised at less than \u20ac10 (\u00a38) a night, while a bucket of beer can cost half that. Drugs like marijuana and mushrooms are in ready supply, openly advertised at cafes and diners. During the early 2000s and 2010s the town was famous for hardcore partying and as a spot for riding inflatables down the local river. But after several tourists were injured or died, efforts were made at raising safety standards. \u201cTo combat the river tubing deaths they demolished a bunch of the riverside bars that were selling buckets of vodka to people floating by,\u201d one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.\n\nVang Vieng in Laos are popular with backpackers travelling through South East Asia\n\nLaos officials aimed to re-centre the town as a spot for eco-tourism rather than just a hub for the young and drunk. \u201cAnd it worked,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s actually changed a quite a lot in the past decade, they\u2019ve cleaned it up, it\u2019s way more modern than it used to be.\" But because of that: \u201cI think it can be very easy for young travellers to miss that this is still a very poor country with lax regulations and safety standards.\u201d The diplomat said methanol poisoning - where alcoholic drinks are contaminated with a toxic compound - is well-known among consulates and tourism operators. Consulates are fairly regularly having to deal with cases of tourists who have fallen ill from dodgy drinks, the diplomat noted. South East Asia is documented as the worst region for methanol poisoning. Local producers making cheap alcohol often will not correctly reduce the toxic level of methanol produced in the process. Thousands of incidents are recorded every year in the region,, external according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). But for tourists, awareness around poisonous alcohol is low. British backpacker Sarisha told the BBC's Newsbeat programme that people did not seem to consider the risks of free drinks when she was recently staying at Nana Backpacker. Like most other hostels, happy hours were a daily staple at the venue as well as free shots of local vodkas as courtesies, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very party city,\u201d she said.\n\nTourists still in town are now taking extra precautions after the shocking deaths. On Friday, Miika, 19, a Finnish backpacker staying at a hostel just 10 minutes walk from Nana Backpacker, told the BBC he and his friends had arrived in town two days ago. They were now only ordering bottled beers and rethinking river tubing because shots were included. \u201cNow because we know about this, we didn\u2019t really want to go there,\u201d he said. British woman Natasha Moore, 22, told the BBC she cancelled her booking for Nana Backpacker after hearing about the deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s just so scary, I feel so overwhelmed\u2026 it feels like I\u2019ve escaped death, almost like survivor's guilt\", she said in a TikTok video warning other travellers. Her group arrived in the town two days after the poisoning, where \u201cit was still kind of hush hush, nobody really knew too much about what was going on\". She knew many travellers decided to skip the town and said there were signs in the hostel warning to be careful about drinks. She said she \"can't even count how many free drinks\" she had on her travels, but over five nights in Vang Vieng, she and her friends had no free drinks or spirits, only bottled alcohol. \u201cI feel so, so sad and upset for all the friends and family and the people still in hospital. It's just so unfair, we were just trying to have a good time,\" she said. \u201cWe've worked hard to save up to go travel, like it's such a brave thing to do, and then something like that can happen.\u201d",

A heavy defeat by New Zealand saw India's net run-rate plummet, but they still took 18.5 overs to chase just 106 against their rivals. It was a comfortable chase in the end with such little scoreboard pressure, but Fatima Sana's two wickets in two balls in the 16th over, with 26 runs still needed, kept Pakistan in the hunt. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur showed composure with 29 from 24 balls, though she had to retire hurt with two runs required, leaving Sajeevan Sajana to hit the winning runs from her first ball. The nerves had increased because there was such little intent or urgency throughout the modest chase, with the usually aggressive opener Shafali Verma making 32 from 35 balls and Jemimah Rodrigues adding 23 from 28. Bowlers dominated in both innings, with no batter looking particularly comfortable in timing the ball as seamer Arundhati Reddy starred with 3-19 for India. Nida Dar top-scored with 28 from 34 balls for Pakistan but they lost wickets regularly, and failed to put a decent partnership together to put India's bowlers under the pump. In contrast, India managed to keep wickets in hand, which made their approach even more perplexing as they crawled to 25-1 after the six-over powerplay without hitting a boundary. But they are off the mark and though they will be favourites in their next match against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, are still under huge pressure to reach the semi-finals with defending champions Australia still to come in their group. Pakistan are also still in contention but also face a significant challenge as Australia are their next opponents on Friday.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIndia were under significant scrutiny coming into their second match after they were stunned by New Zealand, with all of their matches being essentially must-win because of the fact heavy favourites Australia are also in their group. It may have been gritty and they made hard work of it, but the tournament so far has not favoured a particularly free-flowing style of cricket, with New Zealand's 160 the only total of more than a run a ball so far. Harmanpreet marshalled her bowlers expertly after losing the toss, with leg-spinner Asha Sobhana's two easy dropped chances the only blemish in an otherwise very professional effort. The wickets were shared, with seamer Renuka Singh Thakur removing Gull Feroza in the first over to peg Pakistan back, before Shreyanka Patil, Deepti Sharma and Reddy worked their way through a nervous-looking middle order. The captain could only watch as her openers tentatively prodded their way through the powerplay, with Smriti Mandhana first to fall for seven from 16 balls. And while the total never felt beyond their control, it felt tense and frustrating throughout before Harmanpreet's arrival as the captain decided to set an example, using her feet and running hard between the wickets to finally score at a strike-rate of beyond 100. She was injured while scrambling back into her crease after Muneeba Ali missed a stumping, and seemed to hurt her neck or shoulder, so India will be hoping for a swift recovery because an in-form and confident Harmanpreet, with the added incentive of a point to prove, could go a long way in deciding whether they make it out of the group.\n\nSmriti Mandhana, standing in for captain Harmanpreet Kaur: \"I think it's too soon to say anything [about Harmanpreet]. She's with the medical staff, but hopefully it's not too bad. \"Our bowling team was disciplined, they followed our plans but a better start with the bat would have been nice. We will take momentum from this game.\u201d England bowler Tash Farrant on BBC Test Match Special: \u201cIt was a convincing win for India in the end but a baffling one as well because we thought that, after keeping Pakistan down to that low total of 105, they were going to come out all guns blazing and try to get that total as quickly as they could. \u201cThey have got their first win on the board, but I don't think it will have put much fear into the other teams they are going to face in the group stages.\u201d\n\u2022 None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "Two people died and six were injured in the blast\n\nA second body has been found following an explosion which also killed a seven-year-old boy. The victim, believed to be a man in his 30s, was found in the remains of three houses destroyed on Violet Close in Benwell, Newcastle. The blast, which happened at about 00:45 BST on Wednesday, destroyed six flats along the street. An investigation by emergency services is under way and gas service workers remain at the scene.\n\nFormal identification of both of those who died is yet to take place, Northumbria Police said. Five adults and a child were also taken to hospital with varying degrees of injuries, with all but one discharged following treatment. A man aged in his 30s remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition. Officers also confirmed there were no reports of people related to the properties still missing.\n\nFloral tributes have been left at the scene\n\nCordons around the site are \"expected to be in place for some time\", police said. Supt Darren Adams said the force was \"committed to providing answers to what has happened\". It said housing officers had ensured all those living nearby and who had been evacuated had a place to stay. Some were with friends and family while others were in temporary hotel accommodation. The authority said it was working to secure \"suitable long-term options\".\n\nSeveral community centres in the area have opened their doors to support people affected. The Reverend Chris Minchin of Benwell and Scotswood Team Parish, said people had been making donations, including baby clothes, because a lot of young families had been affected. He said many people caught up in the explosion had to leave their homes in their pyjamas, \"grabbing\" pets as they fled. One of those living nearby, Jodie Holmes, said she was \"just drifting off to sleep\" when she heard a \"boom\". She said: \"We got up and went outside. You could hear the screams, crying.\"\n\nJodie Holmes volunteered at the community centre housing people who had been evacuated\n\nMs Holmes went to volunteer at the nearby community centre which opened \"within minutes\" of the explosion. She said 60 to 70 residents were there overnight. \"Everyone was in shock,\" she said. \"Kids were sleeping under the tables on blankets.\" The Red Cross gave out mobile phone chargers and food at the evacuation centre. Volunteers have since been sorting donation boxes to give to the families affected. Meanwhile, West End Women and Girls Centre also opened up to offer food and a \"warm welcome\".",
    "Workers at Meta have reportedly been sacked for abusing the tech firm's meal voucher system, such as using it to buy toothpaste and washing powder. Other breaches of the policy included sharing the vouchers with others or going over budget, according to people who said they work at Meta. There are differing accounts over how much warning, if any, the owner of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp gave the workers before firing them. Separately, the company has reportedly cut jobs across the business. Meta has been contacted for comment.\n\nMeta staff are given $25 (\u00a319) for lunch, $20 for breakfast, and $25 for dinner in vouchers which are meant to be used for ordering food from Grubhub, the US name for takeaway website Just Eat. Posts on anonymous work social message board Blind appear to confirm elements of the story, originally reported by the Financial Times. One user wrote that more than 30 people were fired last week because they used the credits for \"non-food items, shared credits with people, or went above budget\". Examples of the non-food items bought included toothpaste, toothbrushes and wine glasses. \"They were given a warning to stop which most of them did, but were still fired three months later even after stopping,\" the user said. Some repeated the claim the staff were warned, though other users wrote that there were no warnings. Separately, the company has also reportedly made job cuts at WhatsApp, Instagram and Reality Labs, its virtual reality business responsible for the Oculus headset. These cuts are not related to the issues surrounding the voucher system. Jane Manchun Wong, a former security engineer at Meta, said on Wednesday that she had lost her job as part of these wider layoffs. \"I\u2019m still trying to process this but I\u2019m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ms Wong was hired just over a year ago as a software engineer after making 2022's Forbes 30 under 30 list. The layoffs were first reported by Verge, with a spokesperson telling the tech publication: \"A few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\"",
    "Paramedics who attended Dawn Sturgess' partner after he fell ill feared he was suffering from nerve agent poisoning, but were overruled by police, an inquiry heard. Ms Sturgess, 44, was inadvertently exposed to the deadly nerve agent Novichok in Amesbury in June 2018. Paramedics told the inquiry they initially misdiagnosed the mother-of-three with opiate-poisoning due to an overlap of symptoms. The inquiry was also told \"more could have been done\" to train staff on \"misdiagnosis awareness\".\n\nBy the time Ms Sturgess' partner Charlie Rowley become ill later that afternoon, paramedics raised concerns this could be nerve agent poisoning, but were effectively \u201coverruled\u201d by Wiltshire Police, the hearing was told. A member of the critical care paramedics, Keith Coomber, told the inquiry he administered naloxone to Ms Sturgess but said he did not notice if it had any effect on her as he was busy. He added if Ms Sturgess had not had an opiate overdose it was \"not going to do anything bad but it\u2019ll help reverse... if it was\". Wayne Darch, who was head of emergency operations at the South Western Ambulance Service in 2018, told the inquiry \"more could have been done\" to train staff on \"misdiagnosis awareness\".\n\nThe inquiry heard the vial carrying the nerve agent contained \"enough poison to kill thousands of people\"\n\nIt is understood the nerve agent had been hidden inside a designer perfume bottle, which Ms Sturgess\u2019 partner unknowingly gave to her. Lead counsel Andrew O\u2019Connor KC told the inquiry she suffered from heart failure because of the Novichok poison. In the end, he adds, the brain injury Ms Sturgess sustained from a lack of oxygen during the initial period was the \"immediate cause\" of her death. The overriding question posed by Mr O\u2019Connor at the inquiry is: \u201cWas the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess preventable?\u201d Mr Darch told the inquiry that poisoning from organophosphates, a toxic chemical compound, can come from several sources including pesticides, fertiliser, and flammable retardants.\n\nMr Darch said his ambulance crews often attended opiate-related overdoses and had confused the overlapping symptoms with nerve agent poisoning\n\nHe added: \u201cA number of our clinicians will go a whole career without witnessing or attending an organophosphate or nerve agent poisoning, whether accidental or deliberate. \u201cWe responded to the symptoms that we believed were of an opiate overdose nature. It was some hours later that it became known this was not an opiate-related incident. \u201cMy perspective is that at the time we did the best we could with what we had available to us.\u201d\n\nJust four months prior to her death, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal had been poisoned with the same nerve agent, roughly eight miles away in Salisbury. The pair had gone for lunch at a pub before they were both found collapsed \"in a serious condition\" on a shopping centre bench. A report at the time stated ambulance staff had similarly misdiagnosed the pair, and the actual cause of their illness was not revealed until \"15 hours later\". Fortunately, both made a full recovery and are currently living under protection.\n\nSkripal and his daughter were suffering from the effects of a toxic chemical, which had been left on the doorknob of his home\n\nMichael Mansfield KC, representing the family of Dawn Sturgess, raised the question of what provisions had been made to protect the public following this initial attack in March. Local emergency workers appear not to have been warned to look out for the fact that symptoms between drug overdoses and nerve agent poisonings can be easily confused - meaning it was not on their immediate radar when Ms Sturgess fell ill. Mr Mansfield also referenced an internal document sent by the Department of Health and Social Care ten days after the Salisbury poisonings, titled 'Risk of Secondary Incident'. It contained a list of the worst-case scenarios, one of which was deemed the \u2018accidental discovery of a discarded agent\u2019 elsewhere. However, the letter was advised \"not to be forwarded further than necessary\", and Mr Darch insists he never saw it.\n\nMr Mansfield said staff and the public should have been made aware after the Salisbury poisonings that there was a potential risk of further harm\n\nMr Mansfield said: \u201cOne of the problems after the Salisbury attack was a mindset, that because Novichok or nerve agent poisoning was rare or virtually unknown, that it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Mr Darch said he was responding on the advice of Public Health experts at the time that the \"risk was extremely low\". Dep Ch Con Paul Mills, also presenting evidence at the inquiry, was the senior Wiltshire Police officer in charge of the Novichok response. He explained: \u201cIt was my understanding at that point in time, that this was an isolated incident. \"That Mr Skripal had been targeted and there was no more information intelligence which indicated there was a wider potential threat for a further attack. \"In hindsight, I think we should have put some advice and guidance out to staff, reaffirming their training and the types of symptoms that may present in a secondary incident,\" he added.\n\nBBC reporter Dan O'Brien has been attending the inquiry at Salisbury Guildhall. \"The afternoon session heard from a paramedic and an emergency responder who both attended to the 999 call Charlie Rowley made when Dawn became unwell after exposure to the nerve agent in the perfume bottle. \"Her heart had stopped - they believed a cardiac arrest linked to a neurological episode. They gave her naloxone, used for drug overdose patients. \"After the Skripal nerve agent poisoning in Salisbury four months earlier, it had been flagged that one could be misdiagnosed as the other - but that had not been communicated to emergency staff. \"They did not see need to use another type of medicine - DuoDote - which all ambulance crews had carried on board since 2017, designed to treat exposure to nerve agents and chemical poisoning like fertilisers. \"No one has criticised the quality of care of these first responders themselves today, but there have been challenging questions for their leaders. \"Communicating the risk of misdiagnoses was not the only issue raised today. \"Worst-case-scenario advice issued at high levels of government warning of the risk to emergency workers and the public of potential further incidents due to the discarding of the material had not been passed on to local ambulance and police bosses.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Wiltshire\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

    "Ministers are giving magistrates new sentencing powers in an effort to ease record delays to criminal trials, despite the fact that they are likely to temporarily push the prison population back up. Magistrates in England and Wales will be able to jail offenders for up to 12 months from November to stop cases clogging up crown courts. The plan was first tried by the former Conservative government before being scrapped as jails filled, but Labour says its version will work long-term. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told MPs that it will ultimately help slash the record number of suspects being held waiting a trial.\n\nThe move is already facing a backlash from criminal lawyers who view it as a sticking plaster for a chronic lack of cash in a crisis-ridden system. Magistrates in England and Wales have historically been limited to sentencing offenders to a maximum of six months for a single offence. More serious cases were left for judges in crown courts. But there is a backlog of around 68,000 cases in those higher courts and a record 17,000 suspects on remand waiting for a trial. That backlog was primarily caused by cuts before the pandemic, but exacerbated by the 2020 national shutdown and a later strike by barristers. Last month, as the prisons reached capacity, the government began an emergency plan to let some offenders leave jail on a monitored licence after serving 40% of their term behind bars. The scheme aims to buy the system breathing space as the new government looks at major reforms to how sentencing should work.\n\nMs Mahmood told MPs that while the early release scheme was now working as planned, there was still an acute problem in jails holding too many remand prisoners. She said that by giving magistrates the power to decide cases that would lead to jail sentences of up to 12 months, the record remand population would begin to fall. In turn, with fewer suspects having to go to crown courts, judges would gain an extra 2,000 days a year to deal with the most serious cases and start to reduce the unprecedented delays. Critics say that the Conservatives' earlier attempt at this plan, between 2022 and 2023, failed because it led to more people in jail with very little change in the backlogs. The modelling for the new government's projections will be published when the new rules are formally presented to MPs. The BBC understands that official projections suggest the short-term population rise could turn out to be as little as 100, if the plan succeeds in getting more remand cases through the courts. Outlining the plan to the Commons, Ms Mahmood said ministers had had to make tough decisions that were ducked by their predecessors. \u201cThis Government inherited a criminal justice system in crisis, with dangerously overcrowded prisons and victims waiting far too long to see justice,\u201d she said. \u201cThis marks a further step towards addressing the deep challenges in our criminal justice system, both reducing the record remand population in our jails and delivering swifter justice for victims.\u201d But the plan has already been met with dismay by criminal barristers. Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \u201cThis will simply make things worse. This is a knee-jerk reaction, done without consulting, once again, the criminal barristers or solicitors who deal every day with these cases. \u201cThis suggestion has been tried before but removed very quickly. \u201cDoubling magistrates\u2019 maximum sentencing powers will only increase pressure on reduced prison space, by speedily raising the much bigger sentenced prisoner population.\u201d Mark Beattie, chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, said that its members welcomed the new power to help deliver swifter justice. \u201cI know our members and colleagues will take up this increased responsibility with professionalism and integrity and will - as always - strive to deliver the highest quality of justice in their courts,\u201d he said.",
    "Many people who take up vaping have never been regular smokers\n\nThe number of adults in England to have started vaping despite never having been regular smokers has reached one million, scientists estimate. This is a sharp increase on 2020, with disposable vapes having been available since 2021. The rise is driven mostly by young adults - with about one out of every seven 18-24-year-olds who never regularly smoked now using e-cigarettes. While some may have benefited by taking up vapes instead of traditional cigarettes - the trend could be worrying, experts say.\n\nLead researcher, Dr Sarah Jackson, at University College London (UCL), said the public-health impact of the \"substantial rise\" in vaping among people who have never regularly smoked depended on what they would otherwise be doing. \u201cIt is likely that some would have smoked if vaping were not an available option,\" she said. \"In this case, vaping is clearly less harmful. \"However, for those who would not have gone on to smoke, vaping regularly over a sustained period poses more risk than not vaping.\u201d\n\nResearchers looked at surveys of about 150,000 adults in England between 2016 and 2024. Respondents agreeing with the statement: \u201cI have never been a smoker - ie smoked for a year or more,\" were counted as \"never regular smokers\". And between 2016 and 2020, only 0.5% of these vaped. But by April 2024, this had risen to 3.5%, with more than half aged between 18 and 24. Over the last few years, these \"never regular smokers\" who took up vapes tended to be younger, more were women, and more were drinking at increasing levels, than in the past, researchers say. The study, published in the journal Lancet Public Health, external journal and funded by charity Cancer Research UK, also found overall vaping figures among adults were levelling off.\n\u2022 None Disposable vapes to be banned for child health\n\nSenior researcher, Prof Jamie Brown, at UCL, said: \u201cThese findings are a reminder that action is required to try to minimise vaping among young people who have never previously smoked. \"However, a balancing act is required to avoid deterring smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit.\" Current government plans to ban disposable vapes were unlikely to be the solution, Prof Brown suggested, as popular brands had already launched reusable products that looked and costed almost the same. \u201cA sensible next step would be to introduce stricter regulation around product appearance, packaging and marketing,\" he added\n\nHazel Cheeseman, chief executive of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said the findings could be a cause for concern and suggested focusing on reducing the appeal of vapes would be the best way to limit the use of vapes in non-smokers. \"The aggressive marketing of products to young people means the government urgently needs to bring back the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, to regulate vape flavours, marketing and branding,\" she said. Peter Hajek, professor of clinical psychology, at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cThe just-released figures from the Office for National Statistics show that UK smoking prevalence is under 12%, an all-time low. \"If much less risky alternatives are allowed to continue to compete with cigarettes, smoking - and heart disease, lung disease and cancers that it causes - will continue to decline as well. \u201cThe UK and USA, which allow vaping, have seen significantly faster declines in cigarette sales and in smoking among young and low-income people than Australia, which bans vaping. \"\n\nDo you vape but have never smoked?

Some of the worst scenes were in the area around Jablanica, a town on the main route between the cities of Mostar and the capital, Sarajevo, about 70km (40 miles) to the north-east. A number of other people have been reported missing and a state of emergency has been declared. Development minister Vojin Mijatovic said the country had witnessed a terrible disaster and appealed for calm.\n\nThe area worst hit by flash floods and landslides was around Jablanica\n\nSearch and rescue work continues as more than a dozen people remain unaccounted for. On Sunday, two more bodies were found in the village of Donja Jablanica. Heavy rain apparently triggered a landslide from a quarry above the village that buried houses, with water levels rising to the roofline of some buildings. Rescuers were clearing the mud from inundated houses by hand. Teams from Serbia, Croatia and North Macedonia had arrived to support, and EU countries were also sending help. On Saturday, officials from the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton said 13 deaths had been confirmed in the area, rather than 16 as earlier reported. In the town of Fojnica, three other deaths were confirmed. Rivers burst their banks after an overnight storm and aerial photos showed many towns and villages left inundated. Roads, bridges and railway tracks were washed away or blocked by debris, while landslides left houses buried in rocks and earth as high as their upper storeys.\n\nSome of the worst scenes of flooding with in Jablanica and nearby villages\n\nThe main M-17 route, which runs alongside the River Neretva was covered in debris close to Jablanica and a 17km-stretch of railway was badly damaged between nearby Ostrozac and Grabovica to the west. One 200m stretch of track was left hanging in the air by a landslide close to the river south of Jablanica. The local authority in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton warned drivers to avoid dangerous roads around Jablanica. Further east along the Neretva river, one homeowner told Bosnian media that water had flooded house at 03:30 on Friday and that they barely managed to save their son before escaping to neighbours and seeing their house collapse. Meanwhile, 20km to the west of the capital around around Kiseljak, a torrent of water flooded the streets, leaving cars submerged.\n\nThe flooding was not confined to Bosnia. In neighbouring Montenegro, roads were washed away leaving the village of Komarnica cut off. Water levels were also rising in some of Croatia's rivers, and the government in Zagreb said there was a risk of some areas in the city of Karlovac being flooded close to the Kupa river. Much of Central Europe was hit by floods last month, with some of the worst devastation in Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said one four-day period had been the rainiest ever recorded in the region. They said the floods had been made much worse by climate change. Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The last five years were on average around 2.3C warmer than the second half of the 19th Century, according to the Copernicus climate service.",
    "Life of Janey Godley, Glaswegian pub landlady who became street-fighter of comedy\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nJaney Godley, who has died aged 63, turned an early life full of pain and tragedy into a successful comedy career. A tough upbringing in the east end of Glasgow was the thread which ran through her humour. Often angry, she specialised in wringing laughs out of the most unlikely material. Her act mirrored the city that shaped her: working-class, foul-mouthed, simultaneously angry and sentimental. She delivered her comic broadsides at high speed, jabbing her points home like a street-fighter. For her fans, she was one of them - and as her reputation grew so did her influence. The former pub landlady became close friends with Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, after her videos voicing-over the FM's Covid press conferences became a viral sensation.\n\nShe was born Jane Godley Currie on 20 January 1961 in the Shettleston area of Glasgow, the youngest of four children. Both her parents were addicted to alcohol and the family home was both chaotic and very poor. As a young child she was sexually abused by an uncle. Thirty years later in 1996, she and her sister went public to talk about the abuse after their evidence convicted David Percy. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Interviewed at the time, she said: \"We waited 30 years but we did it, and we did it together. Anyone who has been abused knows you cannot shake off the guilt. But the guilty one was Percy.\" There was more tragedy. In 1982 her mother Annie was found dead in the River Clyde. Godley was convinced she had been murdered by her violent boyfriend though the man was never charged, despite the family's calls for an investigation. By then, Godley had married and was running a pub with her husband in the Calton area of Glasgow. They had a daughter, Ashley Storrie, who would later follow her mother into comedy.\n\nAshley Storrie followed her mum into comedy\n\nHer in-laws became an integral part of her comedy act. She often spoke of their criminal connections and it was a family dispute that led to her taking to the stage in her mid-30s. The schism forced them to leave the pub and left them homeless and out of work. She had been performing at occasional open-mic nights but began taking it more seriously. Years of honing her comic patter behind a bar helped and she quickly became established on the comedy circuit. Her stage act was uncompromising. In 2019 she spoke to the Guardian about her material. \"I spoke about my ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: 'You shouldn't talk about that.' But I'm so glad I did. \"The amount of people that came up to me and said: 'I was abused and I've never laughed before'.\"\n\nJaney Godley was close to former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\n\nAs her fame grew she wrote a memoir and novel and became a regular on panel shows. She appeared with Billy Connolly and the late Antony Bourdain, and played a barmaid in the film Wild Rose. Two things introduced her to a global audience and brought her into the world of politics. In 2016 she was photographed at the Turnberry golf resort holding a sign with an offensive word, protesting the visit by the club's owner, President Trump. The picture went viral. Then, during the Covid lockdowns, she began creating videos in which she voiced-over Nicola Sturgeon's media briefings, portraying the first minister as a plain-talking, occasionally foul-mouthed figure, exhausted by the demands of the pandemic and exasperated by the media's questions. A committed supporter of independence, she had appeared on stage with Alex Salmond and was praised by Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nGodley was a committed and enthusiastic supporter of Scottish independence\n\nThat connection was tested in September 2021 when comments she had posted on social media a decade before came back to haunt her. She was dropped as the face of a Scottish government health campaign and admitted the tweets had \"terrible, horrific undertones\". Two months later, Godley revealed she had ovarian cancer. She documented her illness and treatments on social media and by touring. For a while she was considered clear of the disease but in December 2022 she announced that it had returned. She had been told she could die within the year but continued working. She made a BBC radio programme about her condition and remained a presence on X, formerly Twitter. She was a contributor to BBC programmes including Have I Got News For You and Breaking the News. More recently she made a BBC documentary following her 2023 tour called Janey. In April that year she won the inaugural Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow Award. He said: \"She's a great girl, a great comedian and an extraordinary life story.\" Godley said: \"I can't believe I've won this. I have won an award from a man that I've admired since I was a child.\" Holding up the prize, she said \"This is going to be my tombstone.\"",
    "In a warming Arctic, polar bears are spending more of their time on land\n\nAs the Arctic warms, polar bears face a growing risk of contracting viruses, bacteria and parasites that they were less likely to encounter just 30 years ago, research has revealed. In a study that has provided clues about how polar bear disease could be linked to ice loss, scientists examined blood samples from bears in the Chukchi Sea - between Alaska and Russia. They analysed samples that had been gathered between 1987 and 1994, then collected and studied samples three decades later - between 2008 and 2017. The researchers found that significantly more of the recent blood samples contained chemical signals that bears had been infected with one of five viruses, bacteria or parasites.\n\nWildlife biologist Karyn Rode (here with a sedated wild polar bear) and her colleagues collected blood samples from wild bears to monitor the animals' health\n\nIt is difficult to know, from blood samples, how the bears\u2019 physical health was affected, but wildlife biologist Dr Karyn Rode from the US Geological Survey said it showed that something was changing throughout the whole Arctic ecosystem. The researchers tested for six different pathogens in total - viruses, bacteria or parasites that are primarily associated with land-based animals but have been recorded before in marine animals, including species that polar bears hunt. The study covered three decades, Dr Rode said, \u201cwhen there had been a substantial loss of sea ice and there\u2019s been increased land use in [this population of polar bears]\". \u201cSo we wanted to know if exposure had changed - particularly for some of these pathogens that we think are primarily land-oriented.\u201d The five pathogens, as disease-causing agents are collectively called, that have become more common in polar bears, are two parasites that cause toxoplasmosis and neosporosis, two types of bacteria that cause rabbit fever and brucellosis, and the virus that causes canine distemper. \"Bears in general are pretty robust to disease,\" explained Dr Rode. \"It's not typically been known to affect bear population, but I think what it just highlights is that things [in the Arctic] are changing.\"\n\u2022 None There are about 26,000 polar bears left in the world, with the majority in Canada. Populations are also found in the US, Russia, Greenland and Norway\n\u2022 None Polar bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with climate change a key factor in their decline\n\u2022 None Adult males can grow to be around 3m long and can weigh close to 600kg\n\u2022 None Polar bears can eat up to 45kg of blubber in one sitting\n\u2022 None These bears have a powerful sense of smell and can sniff out prey from up to 16km away\n\u2022 None They are strong swimmers and have been spotted up to 100km offshore. They can swim at speeds of around 10km per hour, due in part to their paws being slightly webbed\n\nStudies with collar cameras have revealed what polar bears eat during the ice-free summer, as well as capturing surprising social interactions\n\nIn the US, polar bears are classified as a threatened species; scientists say the biggest threat to their future is the continuing loss of sea ice habitat, which they depend on as a platform from which to pounce on their marine prey. Previous research using collar cameras on bears has shown that, as they spend more of the year on land - when there is no available sea ice to hunt from - the bears are unable to find enough calories. Dr Rode explained that polar bears are top predators: \u201cOur study suggested that they're getting their exposure to some pathogens primarily through their prey species. \u201cSo what we saw as changes in pathogen exposure for polar bears is indicative of changes that other species are also experiencing.\u201d The findings are published in the scientific jou, externalrnal PLOS One, external.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "Teen who killed Holly Newton can be named - judge\n\nA judge has ruled Holly Newton's murderer can be named as her ex-boyfriend Logan MacPhail\n\nFifteen-year-old Holly Newton was murdered by her \"jealous\" ex-boyfriend, it can now be revealed. Holly was repeatedly stabbed in an alleyway in Hexham, Northumberland, by Logan MacPhail in January 2023. MacPhail, who was 16 at the time, had anonymity during his murder trial but ahead of sentencing, Judge Sir Nicholas Hilliard KC lifted reporting restrictions following an appeal by media groups, including the BBC. Holly's parents said their daughter's killing should be classed as a domestic violence offence rather than a knife crime.\n\nHolly Newton's killer will be sentenced at the end of October\n\nMacPhail, now 17, had turned up uninvited at Holly's home in Haltwhistle the night before the killing and stalked her through Hexham for almost an hour before he attacked. The pair met at army cadets in Consett and were in an \"on-and-off\" relationship for 18 months, which ended days before the killing. Holly's family said he was controlling and prosecutors described the relationship as \"toxic\". Holly's mother Micala Trussler had arranged a meeting with Northumbria Police to discuss her fears about him for the evening of 27 January, but Holly was killed hours before it could take place.\n\u2022 None 'I instantly knew my daughter's ex had killed her'\n\nMacPhail left his school in Gateshead at lunchtime and took a bus to Hexham. That morning, Holly told friends he was \"basically stalking\" her and feared he would be waiting outside her school, Queen Elizabeth High.\n\nHolly Newton had complained of her ex-boyfriend stalking her\n\nMacPhail messaged a friend of Holly's, lying about where he was and asking her to \"trick\" Holly into meeting him. After Holly left school with friends, MacPhail, wearing a cap and snood to conceal his face, tailed her round town for more than 45 minutes. CCTV footage showed his pursuit before he confronted her at a bus stop outside Pizza Pizza, on Priestpopple, at about 17:00 GMT.\n\nThey spoke for several minutes before Holly followed him into an alley where he launched a vicious attack which several people tried to stop. At his trial, he claimed he wanted to return some of Holly\u2019s possessions - slippers, clothes and teddy bears - but he had none of these with him.\n\nMacPhail initially told the murder trial his mind was \"blank\" during the attack and he was trying to kill himself with the knife, although the court heard he had no injuries. He then admitted deliberately stabbing her, later retracting his confession.\n\nMacPhail (in the red box) followed Holly (in the yellow frame) for almost an hour before attacking her\n\nHolly had 36 knife wounds to her head and body and died from catastrophic blood loss. The 8cm (3in) blade of the kitchen knife broke during the attack. Another youth who intervened was stabbed four times, with MacPhail also found guilty of his wounding.\n\nThe BBC applied for the reporting restriction, which was put in place because MacPhail was under 18, to be lifted. Mr Justice Hilliard said MacPhail had been convicted of \"grave crimes\" which were of local and national concern\" but the \"key factor\" of the killer's relationship with Holly could not be reported during the trial \"lest it might identify him\". The judge said it was \"impossible to have a full and proper understanding of the case and of why the defendant behaved as he did without knowing this factor\". He said there was \"great public concern\" about young people carrying knives and \"violence to women and girls\" and legitimate debate was aided by the public knowing the \"full detail of the offences\". A two-day sentencing hearing is due to begin on 31 October.",
    "Emergency services remain at the scene of the collision on Wednesday\n\nA man who died after the train he was travelling on collided with another train in mid Wales has been named locally as Tudor Evans. It has also been revealed that a driver of one train was \"quite badly injured\" and a conductor suffered a fracture, Transport for Wales (TfW) has confirmed. Four people were seriously injured in the crash near Llanbrynmair, Powys, on Monday evening, and a further 11 required hospital treatment, according to the Rail Accident Investigations Branch (RAIB). The line will be shut until at least Friday, and Network Rail said it would look at \"immediate lessons\" to stop any future crashes before it reopens.\n\nMr Evans had been travelling home on the 18:31 westbound service from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth on Monday evening when it hit a stationary train heading from Machynlleth to Shrewsbury. He was in his 60s and from Capel Dewi in Aberystwyth. Paying tribute, Iestyn Leyshon said he was \"extremely saddened\" to hear of the death of his friend, who was travelling home from a holiday in Italy. Mr Leyshon, from Aberystwyth, told the Newyddion S4C app, external he had known Mr Evans for about 20 years but got to know him well over the past four years through their shared passion for mountain biking. \u201cIt pains me to think that he and his wife had just begun to travel after years of work and then this tragedy happens,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll never see him on his bike on the Elenydd [an upland area of mid Wales] again.\u201d\n\nRIAB inspectors near the site of Monday evening's collision\n\nTfW's chief operating officer Jan Chaudhry-Van Der Velde also gave his sympathies to the family. He added that a driver of one of the trains was \"quite badly injured\" in the crash and taken to hospital in Shrewsbury, while a conductor suffered a fracture. Both the injured driver and conductor have received medical care and \"are on the road to recovery,\" he said. Mr Chaudhry-Van Der Velde did not say which of the trains the driver and the conductor were on, but confirmed the injured driver did not have time to leave the cab before the impact. He also said the trains' \"black boxes\" will be retrieved so all information can be passed to the investigators to help understand the cause. The crash happened on the Cambrian line in a rural location with a single track, close to a passing loop where trains travelling in opposite directions can pass each other. The RAIB deployed a team of inspectors to the site of the crash and said initial evidence suggested the collision occurred at a speed of approximately 24km/h (15mph). On initial inspection, the RAIB found that the train may have entered into wheel slide when braking.\n\nThe line between Machynlleth and Shrewsbury will remain closed until Friday 25 October\n\nThe investigation is continuing and is likely to continue for at least the next 24 hours, said Network Rail route director Nick Millington. He described the investigation as \"complex\" and said he was \"unable to speculate on if leaves on the tracks contributed to the crash\" but control and communication systems on the trains \"were being scrutinised\". Network Rail and TfW said the Cambrian line between Machynlleth and Shrewsbury will remain closed until at least the end of Friday. They thanked the community and said the investigation will move to a recovery operation to remove the affected trains over the coming days. A full report would take several months to be processed, said Mr Chaudhry-Van Der Velde.\n\nIt will be months before a full report will be finalised says TfW\n\nTransport Minister Ken Skates said the Welsh government's \"prime concern\" is safety. Politicians sent their thoughts to train crash victims during prime minister's questions on Wednesday. Speaking in the House of Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner sent her \"condolences to those affected by the train crash in Powys\". Deputy leader of the opposition Oliver Dowden echoed her comments about the crash. A passenger on the westbound train spoke of being knocked out by the impact after hearing \"emergency brakes slam on, then the screeching\". Bethan Evans, 23, was on the last leg of her journey when the collision took place. She said the crash had flung people out of their seats into the aisle, and her belongings were also thrown in the aisle. UK government Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said she was \"incredibly sorry\" to hear about the crash and safety on the railways is her \"absolute priority.\" She added: \"We are working at pace with Transport for Wales and Network Rail to understand what happened and how we can better prevent it going forward.\"",
    "A thick blanket of smog has derailed normal activity for most people\n\nAt first, you cannot see it but you can smell it. It smells like something is burning. And it intensifies as the temperature drops. Then the smoke and fog start to envelop you and the city around you. Now you can see it. You are walking through the smoke, a thick ceiling of it hanging overhead. If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air. Your throat might start to feel itchy and sore. As it gets worse, you start sneezing and coughing. But it's worse for others: children, the elderly, those with breathing difficulties. The hospitals know to expect the influx. Lahore and its 13 million residents have now been choking for a week; the air quality index has passed the 1,000 mark repeatedly this month - anything above 300 is considered hazardous.\n\nPakistani officials have scrambled to respond to the crisis - its scale unprecedented even in a city which deals with smog at this time each year. Schools are closed, workers have been told to stay home and people urged to stay indoors - part of a so-called \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d, which has also seen motorbike rickshaws, heavy vehicles and motorbike parking banned from hot spot areas. By the end of the week, Lahore High Court had ordered all the markets in the Punjab province to close by 20:00 each night, with complete closures on Sundays. Parks and zoos have also been shut until 17 November. The problem, according to Nasa scientist Pawan Gupta, is that pollution levels in the city \u201ctypically peak in late November and December\u201d. \u201cSo this is just beginning. The worst pollution days are probably still ahead of us,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe smoke that has enveloped Lahore, in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province, can be seen from space - as can part of the cause. Satellite images from the US space agency Nasa shows both the thick layer of smog and the multiple concentrations of fire in the region between the Indian capital, Delhi, and Pakistan\u2019s Lahore. The same image, six weeks earlier, shows clear skies and - crucially - far fewer fires. A major cause of the smog is the fires which are caused by the burning of stubble after harvest by farmers in both Pakistan and India - a quick way to clear their fields ready for the next crops.\n\nPakistan authorities accuse Indian farmers of causing 30% of the problem\n\nThis year, Nasa estimates it will count \u201cbetween 15,500 and 18,500 fires \u201d, according to Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Morgan State University, higher than most years. According to Pakistan\u2019s environment protection authorities, around 30% of Lahore\u2019s smog comes from across the border in India. The Indian government has this year doubled fines for farmers caught stubble-burning as it tries to deal with the issue. But much of Lahore\u2019s air pollution comes from its five million motorbikes and millions of other vehicles\u2019 exhausts. On Friday, Lahore's high court identified heavy traffic emissions as the main cause of the smog, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. Then there are the industries in the city\u2019s outskirts - like the coal-fired brick kilns - adding even more pollution to the air. And in the final months of the year, it all combines with cold air flowing down from Tibet, creating the smog which is currently sitting over the city.\n\nMany people, like this vegetable vendor, have no option but to go out and earn their living in smog\n\nThe state's high court has laid much of the blame on vehicle emissions\n\nIt is clear the toxic air is making people sick. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI), a value of 50 or below indicates good air quality, while a value above 300 signals Hazardous air quality. The WHO guidelines say the average concentration of PM2.5 level should be below five. Abid Omar, founder of Pakistan\u2019s Air Quality Initiative, which collects data from 143 air quality monitors across the country, says the readings in Lahore \u201chave hit beyond index on every day in November\u201d. \u201cSome locations in Lahore have exceeded 1,000,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cOn Thursday we had one reading of 1,917 on the AQI scale.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, it was widely reported 900 people had been admitted to hospital in Lahore with breathing difficulties. \u201cMore and more people are coming with complaints of asthma, itchy throats and coughing,\u201d says Dr Irfan Malik, a pulmonologist at one of the biggest hospitals in Lahore. He has already seen a surge in patients complaining of respiratory tract illnesses - \u201cparticularly worrying because we have not yet seen our first cold wave of the winter season\u201d. The danger is a constant concern for Lahore resident Sadia Kashif. \u201cLike every mother, I want to see my children run and play without fearing pollution,\u201d she tells the BBC. \u201cI see my children struggle with coughs and breathing problems these days, and it is a painful reminder that our air has become extremely toxic.\u201d But the current \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d has left her unimpressed. \u201cIt is easy for the government to shut down school rather than taking real steps to address the crisis,\u201d says Kashif.\n\nEmissions from brick kilns around Lahore also contribute to toxic air\n\nFor years, authorities have struggled to find a solution to Lahore\u2019s pollution problem. The government hopes short fixes will provide reprieve, but says long term solutions - like improving public transport - will take time. In the meantime, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced this week she intends to write a letter to her counterpart in Indian Punjab to invite them to engage in \u201cclimate diplomacy\u201d, since it impacts both regions. Delhi says it is yet to hear from Pakistan on the issue.\n\nOfficials are using a number of short-term measures like spraying water to bring down dust particles\n\nHowever, Omar points out air pollution is not a seasonal problem but a persistent issue. \u201cLahore is much more polluted than Delhi with pollution episodes that last longer and reach higher peaks,\u201d he notes. And it is getting worse, he believes. As per his own analysis of data, October has seen a 25% rise in pollution level compared to the same period last year.

    "What the farmers' protest tells us about their argument with the government\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in central London, many with their children in tow\n\nThe farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children. They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation. For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters. As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster. They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy. I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.\n\nI love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too. And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it. This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts: Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation. It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion. That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.\n\nSecondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different. The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing. Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax. And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp. Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money. Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others. And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich? Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds. These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich. Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do. The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign. Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change. You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Influencers risking death in hurricanes for clicks and cash\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWhile millions of people in Florida fled Hurricane Milton, Mike Smalls Jr ventured into the violent winds in Tampa, Florida, holding a blow-up mattress, an umbrella and a pack of ramen noodles. He went outside Wednesday evening as the storm pounded the US state and livestreamed on the platform Kick. He told his online audience if he reached 10,000 views, he would launch himself and his mattress into the water. Once he hit the threshold, he took the plunge. Then he got worried: \u201cThe wind started picking up and I don\u2019t know how to swim\u2026so I had to grab on to the tree.\u201d The area was under an evacuation order - meaning residents had been advised by local officials to leave their homes, for their own safety. Mike\u2019s hour-long stream from Tampa Bay has more than 60,000 views on the streaming platform Kick, and has been seen by millions after being clipped up and posted on other social-media platforms, including X. Live streaming - filming yourself in real time - has become increasingly lucrative for content creators looking to make quick money. But these streams can involve dangerous stunts, as content creators try to stand out in an increasingly competitive environment. Many people have criticised Mike's behaviour on social media, suggesting he\u2019s risking his life for clicks. He made it safely - and told me he'd do the risky stunt again, \u201cif the price is right\u201d. When asked about the backlash, he admits what he did was \u201ccontroversial\u201d and acknowledges that some might think he is risking not just his life, but the lives of those who might have to save him. But, he added: \u201cFrom a content creator standpoint, people like to see kind of edgy things.\"\n\u2022 None 'The tornado was inside our house' - Florida reels after Milton\n\u2022 None 'It's eerie to see its power' - Florida woman documents 20 hours in hurricane\u2019s path in messages to BBC\n\u2022 None Helene is deadliest mainland US hurricane since Katrina The Tampa Police Department said in a statement: \u201cIgnoring mandatory evacuation orders puts lives at risk. When individuals disregard these warnings, they not only jeopardise their own safety, but also create additional challenges for first responders who are working tirelessly to save lives. \"Intentionally placing oneself in harm's way could divert critical resources and delay vital rescue operations for others.\" Hundreds of people have died during this year\u2019s hurricane season, which has devastated parts of the US south-eastern coast. Millions had been forced to evacuate as Hurricane Milton, which at its peak was measured as a category 5 storm, made landfall on Wednesday along Florida's Gulf Coast. At least 16 people have died in the storm, millions are still without power and thousands had to be rescued by first responders as water overtook homes. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have bookended an exceptionally busy period of tropical weather in the US. In less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed - not far off from what the Atlantic would typically see during an entire year.\n\nMike Smalls Jr floated on a mattress during one hurricane and pitched a tent under an overpass for another\n\nMike is one of a number of content creators on social media platforms, including Kick and TikTok, who have been livestreaming and making money from pulling reckless stunts and risking their lives in hurricanes. Livestreaming content is Mike\u2019s full-time job, he says. Previous stunts posted on his profile include setting fireworks off inside a bedroom and winding up staff in fast-food restaurants. His plan for livestreaming Hurricane Milton was: \u201cGet some nice clips, and then, if things get too wild, I can, just, you know, track my little five, 10-minute walk back home,\u201d he added. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d exposed himself to danger. A few weeks before Milton struck, he went out into Hurricane Helene - which also hit Florida - carrying a tent as a prop and livestreamed for more than five hours. He filmed himself on his phone holding up the tent in an underpass, saying he was \u201cgoing to survive the hurricane. Why? To entertain the people\u201d. Just metres away, the ocean was crashing over barriers. \u201cIt's my job just to entertain and think of creative things to entertain my chat. And if people want to, you know, if they're inspired by what I do, I respect it,\" he said, adding you have to gauge and \"do things at your own risk\". Platforms like Kick offer incentives: money for the number of views streamers get and donations from people who like what they\u2019re doing. Smalls Jr did not specify how much money he earned from this particular livestream, but said the metrics vary from streamers, with some making $300 to $400 per hour. He added he made enough from his latest stream to pay a few bills.\n\u2022 None No, Hurricane Milton was not 'engineered'\n\u2022 None Explainer: Why is Hurricane Milton causing so many tornadoes in Florida\n\nIt might appear, Mike says, that he\u2019s doing anything for views, but he says he takes safety very seriously. Despite not knowing how to swim, he insists that he assessed the risks. He speaks with bravado after surviving the natural disaster: \u201cI stayed here, and I didn\u2019t die and I\u2019m chilling.\" When asked to respond to specific questions on Smalls Jr and the platform\u2019s responsibility, Kick said it is \u201ca fiercely creator-first platform, and we do not influence the content our creators chose to stream. However, if that content breaches our Terms of Service, or is in any way illegal, then we can impose a ban or suspension\". They did not comment when asked about whether Smalls Jr's action breach their specific community guidelines which detail: \"Safety First: Prioritise safety for yourself, your audience, the public and anyone else involved.\" TikTok told the BBC that their monetisation guidelines lay out how some content is not eligible to earn money through LIVE features, including \u201ccontent that tricks or manipulates others\u2026 exploits controversial issues to bait engagement, or exploits the suffering of vulnerable people\u201d. Mike\u2019s profile - and his hurricane content - is still available. When asked about endangering the lives of emergency workers, Smalls Jr said he knows what he's getting himself into. \"Don\u2019t save me,\" he said. \"If I do another hurricane? All right. You ain't got to say nothing. I do not want to put your life at risk. No.\u201d",
    "US swing state voters: 'You have a big say on what happens in the entire world'\n\nIn US elections, it's not only who you vote for that matters - just as important can be where you live. The 2024 presidential race will likely come down to seven key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. With tight margins expected, the people that live in these states are the most sought after by political campaigns. As Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump vie for their attention, here's what swing state voters had to say about the at-times stressful role they play.\n\nThis small business owner from western Pennsylvania is a registered Democrat who plans to vote for Harris. I\u2019m out in the rural parts of the state and there's a lot of Trump support out here. But there's also a lot of people that at a certain point... there's certain things that just aren't acceptable. Just the way a lot of us are raised out here, there's things that he's done that it's just not right. [The political advertising] is annoying more than anything else because everybody knows at the end of the day, the advertisements are packed full of lies. We're potentially playing kingmaker here. It is kind of nerve-wracking knowing that we're going to play such a big role because there's a lot of people that are just so burnt out about everything... It's very strange knowing that your neighbours are probably going to have a really big say in what happens in the entire world for the next four years.\n\nAndy lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The retired Marine plans to vote for Trump, who he backed in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. One neighbour across the street might have two Trump signs and then the neighbour next door might have four Harris signs. It's like a battle of who can out-sign the other person. To be at the forefront of the voting every year is cool in a sense that it puts us on the map, but not necessarily always for the best things. I recently moved back [to Pennsylvania] in 2018. When I was coming up to visit my now-wife, I saw Trump signs everywhere in 2016 and I thought: He's going to win. In 2020, I saw less Trump signs and I just got a vibe that there's no way he's going to win. Now, it's 50-50. I have no idea what's going to happen.\n\nThis independent voter has lived most of her life in Wisconsin. The 74 year old is retired and plans to vote for Harris. We are constantly bombarded with political ads on TV... I did see a big, lighted Trump sign when I went shopping. I was sort of shocked by it. It\u2019s a huge sign. I'm just very suspicious about what's going on with a lot of the people in the ads. It's gotten just much worse. The ads have gotten horrendous... distortion is so over the top. I'm definitely voting for Harris and I'm worried because it seems that MAGA [Trump's Make America Great Again movement] can really distort things and confuse people so easily.\n\nThis engineer from the swing state of Michigan is a Democrat who is planning to vote for Harris in November. I've never voted Republican once in my life and I'm still getting mailers in my mailbox addressed to me on practically a daily basis from the Republican Party. It is non-stop, incessant up here and it's exhausting. I want to say that it's really disheartening [to carry the weight of a swing state] because I personally believe in more of a ranked-choice voting style and not necessarily the electoral college. Being part of a state where it is a little bit more neck and neck and more decisive, it's one of those places where I can understand people really need to go out to make their voices heard. But it shouldn't just be focused on this state. Every state should have a similar amount of people wanting to get out, vote and make their voices heard.\n\nJonathan is a teacher who became a US citizen this year. He plans to cast his first vote for Trump. I generally don\u2019t understand - very little changes when a Republican or a Democrat becomes president. I don\u2019t quite understand the hysteria. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many people my age who I hang around with who are desperate for either candidate. Trump talks about the treatment of migrants versus the abortion issue and the treatment of the unborn. I land on Trump being a lesser evil than Kamala Harris in regards to that. I barely watch any typical American television. We probably get more mail in the house, but that\u2019s because now I\u2019m registered to vote so I\u2019m seeing more. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly more prevalent.\n\nThis independent voter backed Biden in the last presidential election and plans to vote for Harris this year. Biden only narrowly won Arizona in 2020. It seems to me that the Trump voters are more on public display. They have their flags. They have their signs. They have their bumper stickers. I don't know if they're proud or they're trying to convince everybody else to do something, but it seems more prevalent that you see that. I've seen a few Harris signs and I like them. But I think that the people who support Harris are not as in your face. I sometimes get nervous because I want Harris to win, but I say to myself: \"I can do one thing. I can only do one thing and that's put my vote in and that's all I can do.\"\n\nThis independent voter is a greenskeeper at a Michigan golf course who plans on reluctantly backing Trump in the election. I live in a rural area, so it's very, very Trumpy up here. It\u2019s almost embarrassing because we get a lot of tourists up here and it's like: You guys are going to put so much Trump stuff on your walls? I have mentioned to my wife that I'm the one the campaigns are aiming at. I'm an independent voter in a swing state. I just view myself as a drop in a bucket when it comes down to it. I understand the way it's working out with the electoral college and I'm in a swing state, so my vote is a little more unusually valuable than it normally would be. But I try not to think about it that way. I'm just a regular guy casting my vote like everybody else.\n\nThis 34-year-old teacher in the swing state of Georgia is an independent voter who plans to vote for Harris. I'm definitely anxious. I know this is a really tight knit race between our two candidates. Political ads are everywhere. Every streaming service, every YouTube video, everything has ads. I've noticed that the Harris-Walz campaign is definitely putting out more advertising than I've noticed from the Trump-Vance campaign here in Georgia. I think it's exciting. I'm excited to see Georgia being a battleground state. For so long, it was staunchly red and staunchly Republican. To have this kind of conversation and be able to know that my vote matters a little bit more and that it's more important than it may have been traditionally is exciting. It's firing me up to get involved in the political process.\n\nThis legal assistant from Beaver, Pennsylvania - the swing state with the highest number of electoral votes - is a Democrat who will be voting for Harris. I'm trying to remain optimistic, but I'm still pretty anxious, because it is Pennsylvania and you're surrounded by the division everywhere. I guess that's what continues to make me anxious living in Pennsylvania and knowing how important Pennsylvania is for these federal elections. I hate to see how purple it is right now. It feels like a responsibility to be from a state like this. The conversation about being in Pennsylvania and the burden of how many delegates we have and all of this - it's really wild.\n\nIn the lead-up to election day, BBC Voter Voices is hearing from Americans around the country about what matters to them.

    "A song from a film featuring popular Bollywood duo Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol came out on top\n\nA blockbuster film track has been voted the UK's favourite noughties Bollywood tune. BBC Asian Network asked listeners to pick their Ultimate 00s Bollywood song from a shortlist of 50 tracks. The list was picked by a panel including station presenters Haroon Rashid, Nikita Kanda, Gagan Grewal and Vallisa Chauhan, along with industry experts Asim Burney, Natasha Retnasingam and music producer Farooq Got Audio. Many of the songs on the list such as Kal Ho Naa Ho's title track, Desi Girl from comedy romance Dostana and Teri Ore from comedy action Singh is Kinng are considered to have soundtracked people\u2019s significant life moments.\n\nBut there could only be one winner: Bole Chudiyan from the iconic film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Released in 2001, the track is remembered for being the signature sound of the family drama movie featuring some of Bollywood's biggest names such as Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Hrithik Roshan. Composed by Jatin-Lalit and written by Sameer Anjaan, the song also features five powerhouse vocalists - Amit Kumar, Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan and Kavita Krishnamurthy.

    "Welsh dentistry 'no example' to England\n\nLast month, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told the Labour Party Conference the \"UK government will take inspiration from Wales on dentistry\" due to reforms\n\nThe idea that Welsh dentistry is an example to England is \"laughable\", a representative of the sector has said. Labour politicians have said Wales has created 400,000 appointments over the past two years. But the British Dental Association (BDA) said that did not take into account the needs of individual patients, while one said he had been suffering dental pain for years. Health Secretary Jeremy Miles said ministers were working with the BDA to reform dentistry contracts to \"focus more on patient needs\".\n\nDental pain sufferer Matty Parry: \"It\u2019s horrendous how people can't get a dentist\"\n\nMatty Parry from Old Colwyn, Conwy county, said he had been pushed from one dentist to another while having dental pain for five years. He is still trying to register for treatment but has been told by one dentist that could mean another two-and-a-half years of waiting. \"It's a shambles,\" he said. \"It\u2019s horrendous how people can't get a dentist. \"They probably need to do more courses, they need to promote it more, to train people up.\" He said paying for treatment was \"unreal\". \"I know people that have spent thousands of pounds on treatment, when really should it be that much?\" Last month, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told the Labour Party Conference the \"UK government will take inspiration from Wales on dentistry, where reforms have already unlocked almost 400,000 appointments in the last two years\". But the latest available figures from the Welsh and UK governments show how dental treatment levels have recovered since Covid. England completed 85% of the average number of courses of treatment being done pre-Covid, but in Wales that figure was much lower, at 58%.\n\nDr Russell Gidney from the BDA said: \"The Welsh dental service is struggling to cope\"\n\nDr Russell Gidney, who runs a dental practice in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, and is a leading member of the BDA, said colleagues were abandoning their NHS contracts because of the targets they were being set, and the financial clawbacks they face if they do not treat enough patients. He said it meant meeting targets were more important than giving people the treatment they need. \"The Welsh dental service is struggling to cope,\" he said. \"There are patient numbers being seen but, because practices are being pushed towards numbers of patients - although that statistic looks good - actually, what they're able to deliver on most patients, is suffering. \"It really is whitewashing the problems that are happening underneath.\" On Wales being held up as an example to England, Dr Gidney said: \"Fundamentally, I find it laughable. \"We've seen more clawback applied to practice since Covid. \"We see more practices hand back their contracts every year than we saw in several years pre-Covid. \"Dentists aren't happy because they can't take care of their patients. \"They can't make the business work as they want to, and fundamentally, where it carries on as it is, it is causing the patients to suffer as well.\"\n\nDr Helen Howson from the health think tank, the Bevan Commission, said the idea of cooperation in all areas of health could bring benefits. \"Partnership and collaboration will actually be a critical part of us finding the solutions we need, and working together will be important,\" she said. \"I think now we have a much more conducive environment to innovate and share and learn together, and that positive and constructive dialogue with all partners, whether it's England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or our international partners, can only be a good thing.\" On Sunday, Health Secretary Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that, while the number of patients receiving treatment had increased in the past 18 months, with 120,000 having received urgent treatment, \"dentistry isn't where we want it to be\". \"What we have done is to reform the dental contract with the BDA in order to focus more on patient needs rather than those regular six monthly check-ups which most people don't need,\" he said. \"The task now is to see what further reforms we can make.\" The Welsh government said changes introduced since 2022 have improved access for around 500,000 people. It said it was working with the BDA to \"explore how reform of the national dental contract can encourage dental practices to work together at a local level\".",
    "BBC apologises to Abbington but her claims only partly upheld\n\nAmanda Abbington was paired with Giovanni Pernice on last year's series of Strictly\n\nThe BBC has apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, but cleared him of the most serious allegations. BBC News has been told that while complaints of verbal bullying and harassment were upheld, claims of physical aggression were not. The Sherlock actress called the BBC's apology a \"vindication\" of her complaint and said she hoped others would now feel \"more confident\" that they would be believed. Pernice said he was relieved that allegations that he was threatening and abusive \"were found not to be true\".\n\nIn its statement on Monday, the BBC said that the production team did take steps to address the issues at the time but acknowledged that \"ultimately, these were not enough\". \"This is why the measures we have taken to further strengthen our existing protocols are so important,\" it said. Abbington had previously accused Pernice of being \"unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean\" during their rehearsals, which he had always strongly denied.\n\u2022 None Strictly: The Story Behind the Headlines\n\nThe BBC said it takes allegations of bullying and harassment \"very seriously\", adding the review into Abbington's complaints had taken time \"due to its complex nature\" and in order to ensure \"a rigorous and robust process\". \"We have assessed the complaints and we have upheld some, but not all, of the complaints made,\" it said. \"We want to apologise to Amanda Abbington and to thank her for coming forward and taking part. We know this would not have been an easy thing to do.\"\n\nAmanda Abbington withdrew from Strictly Come Dancing in October 2023\n\nIn recent media interviews, Abbington said she first raised concerns about Pernice's behaviour with Strictly producers on her third day, and had \"many\" more discussions with programme bosses. She eventually dropped out in week six, expressing her \"deepest regret\" at having to leave the show for \"medical\" and \"personal reasons\". She later lodged a formal complaint about Pernice. The actress has since claimed the BBC had known about his behaviour for years. She has also said she and her family had received death threats after she spoke out. Charlotte Moore, chief content officer for the BBC, told BBC News that it was \"terrible\" Abbington had been subjected to online abuse, and personally apologised to Abbington twice. BBC News has been told the review looked into 17 complaints and six were upheld but we have been unable to independently verify this. The statement itself did not go into detail about the nature of the complaints. But a source told BBC News that those upheld related to verbal bullying and harassment. The most serious allegations of physical aggression were not upheld. When asked by BBC News for more information about the complaints, Moore said: \u201cI'm not able to go into further detail on that, and there are very good reasons for that. \"It's probably worth me just laying out the confidentiality of a complaints process, which I think is absolutely integral to the complaints process, and confidentiality needs to be respected out of fairness to everybody involved.\u201d\n\nResponding to the BBC's statement, Abbington said that coming forward \"was not an easy thing to do\". \"In the days, weeks and months since I contacted the BBC, I\u2019ve been accused of being a liar, a troublemaker and of being 'mad and unstable'. \"I\u2019ve also received rape and murder threats and a bomb threat was sent to my place of work. My family and children have also been subjected to threats and intimidation. \"Despite this vile abuse, I\u2019ve never regretted coming forward, and today\u2019s apology from the BBC is a vindication of my complaint. \"It\u2019s not just a vindication for me, it\u2019s a vindication for the other people who have contacted me since I made my complaint to express concerns about their own experiences on Strictly Come Dancing. I hope those who have felt unable to speak out now will be more confident that they will be listened to and believed.\"\n\u2022 None A timeline of how the Strictly saga has unfolded Abbington added that the BBC had invited her to meet with senior management and that she would be considering this. \"This apology means a great deal to me. So too does the fact that the BBC have acknowledged the steps that were put in place to support and protect me and past contestants were \u201cnot enough\u201d. \"What matters most now is that lessons have been learned and that the BBC makes the changes they\u2019ve promised, to ensure others don\u2019t experience the same ordeal that I and others like me did.\" In a statement, Pernice said: \u2018I\u2019m glad the review has finally come to an end. I'm relieved that the allegations that I was threatening and abusive were found not to be true. \"The majority of the false allegations have been thrown out by the review. It has been an extremely difficult year, reading story after story and not being able to say anything in return as I respected the integrity of the review, which the BBC asked everyone to do.\" He added that he loved his time on Strictly and made \"amazing memories\". \"I\u2019m grateful to all those who have supported me at this time \u2013 I really don\u2019t know how I would have got through this with out the love and belief of my family, friends, colleagues and fans.\" The BBC announced a string of new measures in July, include introducing chaperones in all rehearsal rooms, as well as including two new welfare producers on the show. Earlier this year, the BBC confirmed that Pernice would not return to the Strictly professional line-up for the new series. The new series of Strictly Come Dancing launched on BBC One earlier this month. Pernice has now joined his native Italy's talent dance show, Ballando con le Stelle.",
    "Sum 41 singer alleges abuse by ex-manager in new memoir\n\nSum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley has alleged in a new memoir that he was abused for years by the Canadian rock band's former manager. In the memoir, Whibley accuses the band's first manager, Greig Nori, of grooming and sexually abusing him starting when he was a teenager. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, external, the singer says he kept the dark side of the relationship secret from his bandmates for years.\n\nSum 41 are a multi-award winning punk band formed in 1996 that have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. Whibley's memoir, Walking Disaster: My Life Through Heaven and Hell, which was published on Tuesday, documents the ups and downs of the band's early start in the Toronto music scene and its rise to international stardom. Its beginning was aided in part by Mr Nori - then in his 30s and the frontman of a popular Canadian indie band. He met Whibley after a show and begin to mentor him. Mr Nori later became the fledgling band's manager. Whibley said one night, Mr Nori suddenly, \"passionately\" kissed him in a bathroom stall at a rave, surprising and confusing the then-18 year old, who was high on ecstasy at the time. He alleges Mr Nori coerced him into an unwanted sexual relationship that lasted about four years. \"Greig kept pushing for things to happen when we were together,\" he writes in the memoir, according to the Toronto Star. \"I started feeling like I was being pressured to do something against my will.\" When the physical relationship ended, Whibley, now 44, alleges Mr Nori continued with verbal and psychological abuse. Whibley alleges he revealed the relationship to his former wife, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne, who said: \"That's abuse! He sexually abused you.\" The couple were married from 2006 to 2009. The Sum 41singer told the Toronto Star , externalin an interview that he thought the relationship with Mr Nori would be \"a deep, dark secret I was going to take to my grave\". \"But I didn't know how to tell the story [of the band] without it, because it was so intertwined with everything that was going on in my life back at that point, almost on a daily basis.\" The band parted ways with Mr Nori in 2005. Mr Nori told the Globe and Mail that Whibley's claims were \"false allegations\", and said he had retained a defamation lawyer. The BBC has reached out to Mr Nori for comment. In a statement to the Toronto Star on Thursday, Mr Nori said that: \u201cThe accusation that I initiated the relationship is false. I did not initiate it. Whibley initiated it, aggressively.\u201d He said the relationship eventually \"faded out. Consensually\". Whibley told the LA Times he did not warn Mr Nori about the allegations in the memoir before it was published. \u201cI\u2019ve had an inner battle, like, \u2018Why do I want to tell him? Because I feel like I\u2019m supposed to? Because he still has this thing over me?'\" he told the newspaper. Sum 41 are currently on their farewell world tour and will be disbanding after 28 years together.",
