    "Trump revellers gather in Florida to await his arrival\n\nMusk has been campaigning hard for Trump in Pennsylvania, where polls suggest Trump is in a tie with his Democratic rival\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man, planned to spend election night with Donald Trump in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago resort, he said on X/Twitter. Mr Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, has aggressively campaigned for the Republican candidate in swing states across the country. Trump's campaign is also hosting a watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center for thousands of supporters. The tech billionaire has emerged as one of the most important backers of Trump and donated more than $119m (\u00a391.6m) this election cycle to America PAC - a political action committee he created to support the former president.\n\nMr Musk announced his support for the former president earlier this year, despite saying in 2022 that \"it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset\". He posted a photo of himself on Tuesday saying he voted in Cameron County, Texas - where some of his companies are headquartered - before heading to Florida. Later in the evening, he wrote on X, \"Game, set and match\". The campaign was feeling confident late on Tuesday as supporters gathered at Trump's headquarters in the Palm Beach convention centre to wait for results. At one point, the crowd broke into a dance celebration to YMCA. Huge cheers erupted in the crowd as the state of Florida was projected as a win for Trump, albeit a win that was never in doubt. Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard arrived at the party, after previously attending Trump's more exclusive watch party at Mar-a-Lago. \"There's a lot of really excited people there\" who were \"cautiously optimistic\", she told the BBC. Steve Witkoff, a close friend of Trump, was also with him at Mar-a-Lago. There was \"a strong feeling of excitement and purpose\", he said.\n\nThe crowd included Blake Marnell, who often wore a brick-patterned suit to Trump events in support of Trump's as-yet unfounded promise to build a wall along the southern border. He said he was feeling very optimistic about his candidate's chances. Sergio Ramirez, a businessman originally from El Salvador, claimed Trump could only lose if the Democrats \"cheated... I don\u2019t see how she can win \u2014 Kamala wasn\u2019t a popular candidate.\" Michael, dressed in a \u201cBlacks for Trump 2024\u201d T-shirt. \u201cWe outnumbered them in early voting and we outnumber them now\u201d, he claims. At a formalwear event next door in the Hilton hotel, Iowa Republican delegate Deborah Yanna said it felt like \"Christmas morning\". \"When President Trump takes the White House back, he\u2019s going to make America sparkle again,\" she said. Elsewhere, Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of the Trump White House, plans to hold an election watch party tonight at the Willard Hotel - the five-star Washington DC hotel that served as the \"command centre\" for Trump loyalists seeking to overturn the 2020 election results. Bannon was released from federal prison one week ago, after serving four months behind bars for contempt of the US Congress. Kamala Harris will spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater and a historically black university in Washington DC.",
    "Lando Norris has won in Miami, the Netherlands and Singapore so far this season\n\nLando Norris says he and McLaren will be able to call 2024 a success even if they do not succeed in beating Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen to the title. Norris heads into this weekend's United States Grand Prix, the first of the final six races of the season, 52 points adrift of Verstappen. Briton Norris won the previous race in Singapore four weeks ago with Verstappen second. Norris said: \"We\u2019re fighting against the best of the best but no matter what it has still been a successful season.\" The gap between Verstappen and Norris equates to an average of nearly nine points a race - more than the gap between first and second places. It has narrowed from 78 points following the Belgian Grand Prix, four races ago.\n\nNorris said: \"If I finish second it\u2019s because Red Bull and Max have done a better job. \"We started (the season) a long way behind. Everyone thought Max was going to have an easy win. \"For that not to be the case after the gap they had after race one, it\u2019s still a year to be proud of. \"But as the season goes on, you always reevaluate what are our expectations and now we are a top team and fighting for drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championships. \"I\u2019ve been doing a good job. I have been happy with the job I have been doing and what we are doing as a team and confident if we keep our heads down and keep pushing, we can close the gap. \"It\u2019s not easy, we need more than me first and Max second but I can\u2019t change that, just keep my head down and focus on myself.\" Verstappen has won seven races this season to Norris' three but has not taken the chequered flag first since the Spanish Grand Prix in June. Speaking in Austin on Thursday, the Dutchman said: \"It\u2019s 50-50 - yes or no. There is a lot that can go well or go wrong in these six races, plus sprint races as well. Nothing is guaranteed from both sides. I prefer not to think too much and live weekend to weekend. From now on, every weekend is crucial.\" Norris said McLaren\u2019s belief changed after he took his maiden F1 victory in Miami in early May, but he acknowledged that he and the team had made some mistakes that had stopped them narrowing the gap quicker. \"(There are) races we kind of regret not winning, probably Silverstone being the main one that didn\u2019t go our way when it should have done,\" he said. \"And we look back on that with a bit of regret that we didn\u2019t end up in better positions than we did. \"From Silverstone there was more focus from everyone, including the mechanics and engineers, because it became more and more real that we were in a position we had worked very hard to be in. \"I\u2019m loving it... there is more pressure and a few more nerves but I am still very relaxed and chilled about it.\"",
    "Why there is silence on Ten Hag's Man Utd future\n\nErik ten Hag has been Manchester United manager since 2022\n\nManchester United held a monthly board meeting in central London on Tuesday which the BBC reported as being significant in determining the immediate future of United manager Erik ten Hag. The meeting lasted around six hours, with footage of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe arriving and leaving published by some media. After the big build-up, silence. We don't know the outcome because no-one is saying. Last summer, United took just over two weeks from their FA Cup final win over Manchester City to confirm Ten Hag would continue in his job, after days of speculation before and after the game that the Dutchman would be sacked. The BBC reported that United were considering other managers as part of that review. When Ineos decided to stick with Ten Hag, they triggered the option for an additional year on his contract, which now runs to 2026.\n\nIn addition, significant elements of Ten Hag's backroom team were changed, including the exits of assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag and coach Steve McClaren. To add to the sense of change, in July Dan Ashworth and Omar Berrada finally came off respective periods of gardening leave to take up the sporting director and chief executive roles. This created the structures which Ineos felt United had lacked prior to Ratcliffe's part purchase of the club, which had been announced on 24 December the previous year. After an eighth-place finish, the club's worst of the Premier League era, optimism was high around Old Trafford about a significant improvement. On 29 September, United were hammered 3-0 at home by Tottenham. Questions began to be posed again about Ten Hag's tenure. On 30 September, officials at United let it be known that Ten Hag would stay in his job for the forthcoming games against Porto and Aston Villa. It was not stated the situation would be reassessed after those games, but that was an interpretation some made externally.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Friday, when asked directly in an on-camera interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan whether he \"had faith\" in Ten Hag, Ratcliffe replied: \"I don't want to answer that question. I like Erik. I think he's a very good coach but at the end of the day, it's not my call, it's the management team that's running Manchester United that have to decide how best we run the team in many different respects. \"They've not been there a long time, so they need to take stock and make some sensible decisions. \"Our objective is very clear \u2013 we want to take Manchester United back to where it should be, and it's not there yet, obviously \u2013 that's very clear.\" Ratcliffe's words made headlines - but were also interpreted by some as an indication some kind of decision would be reached after the Villa game. Ratcliffe, Berrada and Ashworth were part of the United delegation at Villa Park, who were all pictured sat together - alongside former manager Sir Alex Ferguson - at the top of the main stand for the 0-0 draw, which dropped United to 14th in the Premier League. Eight points from their opening seven games is United's worst return since the 1989-90 campaign.\n\nSo, after a week featuring two draws in very different styles - a chaotic 3-3 in Porto and a dour 0-0 at Villa - I asked Ten Hag two questions in his post-match news conference, firstly about the external noise and secondly if he felt the owners were still behind him. \"Simon, you said it very good, external noise,\" he replied. \"Internally we are disappointed and we know we have to do better.\u201d And on support from the ownership: \"I don't have any idea it is different because they should have told me. We communicate very open and very transparent.\" By Monday, some sort of clarification was expected from the club, which didn't come. Ratcliffe and co-chairman Joel Glazer were pictured going into Old Trafford. Glazer, it transpired, was attending a meeting of the club's Fan's Advisory Board. Club officials did communicate it was likely the performance of the team would be discussed at the board meeting in London the following day. Attendees were captured arriving and leaving but since then, nothing. Those at United whose responsibility it is to communicate messaging have questioned why they should offer guidance around this board meeting when they never do at any other point. As far as official statements go, there has been nothing. I approached United board member and Ineos Sport chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc for a comment at the European Clubs' Association meeting in Athens he is attending on his club's behalf. He politely declined. For now, Ten Hag remains in his job and he is having a few days away from the club as is customary during an international break. So unless the situation changes, he will return to begin preparations for the Premier League game with Brentford at Old Trafford on 19 October.",
    "A retired police officer is under a criminal investigation over the wrongful conviction of Andy Malkinson for a rape he did not commit, the police watchdog has said. The former Greater Manchester Police officer is being investigated for allegedly perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office in relation to Mr Malkinson\u2019s trial 20 years ago, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said. The former officer and three other officers, who are also retired, are also being investigated for alleged gross misconduct. Mr Malkinson was exonerated last year after suffering the longest miscarriage of justice of the 21st century.\n\nMr Malkinson protested his innocence throughout his 17 years in jail\n\nMr Malkinson said he felt vindicated by the IOPC investigation but he would \"not be satisfied until officers face real consequences\". \"If Greater Manchester Police get away with what they did to me, they'll keep doing it. It's as simple as that,\" he said. Judges at the Court of Appeal were told of long-undisclosed DNA evidence that showed another man must have been the rapist in an attack on a woman in 2003. No forensic evidence ever linked Mr Malkinson to the victim and he did not bear a facial injury that she had inflicted upon her attacker as she fought to defend herself. He did not look like her initial description of the rapist and there was no evidence to link him to the secluded scene of the crime, near Bolton. Mr Malkinson spent 17 years in jail protesting his innocence and a major judge-led inquiry is continuing into how the wrong man was convicted. The decision to investigate the four officers comes after the IOPC took over a review into how GMP had itself handled complaints from Mr Malkinson. An IOPC statement said that it was looking at how GMP came to identify Mr Malkinson as the key suspect and whether witnesses had been offered incentives to pick him out.\n\nThe watchdog said it was also investigating whether there had been a failure to disclose information that may have helped Mr Malkinson at his trial and it was also looking at whether officers followed the \u201cappropriate processes\u201d in how Mr Malkinson had been identified. The watchdog said it was also investigating how GMP handled and disposed of evidence. During Mr Malkinson\u2019s successful appeal last year, it emerged that the original DNA samples recovered from the victim and her clothing had been destroyed. Catherine Bates, IOPC Regional Director, said: \u201cMr Malkinson is a victim of one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history. \u201cFollowing a detailed review of evidence spanning a period of more than 20 years, we have now informed four retired GMP officers that they are under investigation for potential gross misconduct. \u201cOne of the officers has also been notified that they are under criminal investigation for potential misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice in relation to their actions during the police investigation and subsequent trial. \u201cWe will continue to keep Mr Malkinson and GMP updated on our progress.\u201d Emily Bolton, Mr Malkinson's lawyer at the legal charity APPEAL, welcomed the IOPC\u2019s decision to continue its investigation. \"Andy's wrongful imprisonment was not an unavoidable accident,\u201d she said. \u201cPolice accountability isn't optional - it's essential. Andy, his family, and the rape victim in this case all deserve justice.\"",
    "Israeli strikes on Iran kill four soldiers, Iran says\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Projectiles seen in sky over Tehran as Israel hits Iranian targets\n\nIsraeli strikes on Iran, in retaliation for Iran's missile attacks earlier this month, have killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran's army said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran \"recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,\" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks.\n\nTehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was \"limited damage\" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness \"to defend the state of Israel\". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be \"obliged to respond\".\n\nThe US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was \"targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm\" and suggested that was \"precisely what transpired\" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets \"in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates\". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against \"Iranian aggression\" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to \"de-escalate the situation across the region\". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed \"deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation\", while Jordan described the attack as a \"dangerous escalation\". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said \"what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation\". The extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. \"It was an echoing sound... terrible and horrifying,\" the agency quoted him as saying. \"Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it.\" Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF. Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.\n\nTehran at sunrise on Saturday morning, following Israeli strikes on sites around the Iranian capital",

    "Russian cash-for-votes flows into Moldova as nation heads to polls\n\nIlan Shor - pictured here while running for election in 2019 - fled the country before being sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement\n\nThe sniffer dogs at Chisinau Airport have been working extra hard in recent months, searching for money that might be evidence of Russian meddling in Moldovan politics. Ami, a black retriever, gives every suitcase that rolls in on the baggage claim belts a good sniff on all sides. If she detects cash, she will freeze. Back in May she was doing that a lot. That is when customs officers began finding large amounts of money on passengers arriving via connecting flights from Moscow. People who had never left Moldova before were returning from a few days in Russia with wads of notes. \u201cAlmost everyone had money: 2,000, 3,000, 7,000 euros\u201d, the head of customs at Chisinau Airport, Ruslan Alexandrov, remembers. The amounts themselves were not illegal but the patterns were suspicious. \u201cThere were certain flights: Moscow-Istanbul-Chisinau, Moscow-Yerevan-Chisinau,\u201d the customs chief explains. \u201cNormally people don\u2019t come in with that much money. Not from Moscow.\u201d\n\nSo police and prosecutors began seizing the cash. In one day alone they say they scooped $1.5m (\u00a31.2m). No-one ever asked for their money back. The authorities believe the cash mules were part of a major and ongoing operation to buy political influence run by a fugitive Moldovan oligarch named Ilan Shor. Convicted of major fraud in Chisinau, he is now resident in Russia which will not extradite him. Ahead of two key votes this weekend, the capital\u2019s airport is on alert. Flights from all \"high risk\" routes are met by sniffer dogs and at least half the passengers are pulled over for extra baggage scans.\n\u2022 None Explained: Decision time for two countries on future role in Europe On Sunday, President Maia Sandu is running for re-election on a staunchly pro-EU platform, challenged by 10 other candidates. Many are openly sympathetic to Moscow; some see Moldova as a \"bridge\". Voters will also get to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether to enshrine Moldova\u2019s goal of EU accession in the constitution. In fact, membership talks have already begun but the country has been in a battle over its political direction for decades, ever since Moldova gained independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union fell apart. That East-West tug has intensified since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Sandu \u2013 a former World Bank economist first elected on a promise to clean up corruption \u2013 then steered Moldova much more sharply towards the West. She began to openly identify Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia as a major security threat. The Kremlin denies playing any role in Chisinau politics, but officials here accuse Russia of operating via proxies to disrupt and destabilise the country.\n\nPresident Maia Sandu (right) is running for re-election\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anywhere else where we\u2019ve seen such a brazen and open attempt to corrupt an election,\u201d Moldova\u2019s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, Veronica Dragalin, told me this week in her office in Chisinau. Born in Moldova, she spent most of her life in the US \u2013 most recently as a prosecutor in Los Angeles \u2013 before returning to the country and a job in a small office on the fifth floor of a Soviet-era block with a broken lift. What her team say they have uncovered, working with police, is a pyramid payments scheme openly run from Russia by Ilan Shor and his group. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a foreign country sending money in an attempt to influence the election,\u201d Ms Dragalin spells it out. She details evidence gained through wiretaps, police infiltrators and witnesses \u2013 some of which her office has made public. \u201cAt the start they tried to make it look legitimate. Now it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re flagrantly flaunting all the laws\u2026 [and] openly influencing the decision to vote,\u201d the prosecutor says. \u201cThe primary goal is to have the referendum fail.\u201d According to her team, once the cash couriers were detected at the airport and that route made more difficult, payments began to be channelled via a sanctioned Russian bank, PSB. By early October as many as 130,000 voters had received payment through this scheme - about 10% of the active electorate, according to Viorel Cernauteanu, the chief of police. \u201cIn September alone, $15m (\u00a312m) was transferred,\u201d he told me, explaining how they could trace funds and recipients because they gave personal data to open a bank account. Offering money or goods in return for votes is a crime with a possible five-year jail sentence. Last month, a new law made it an administrative offence to accept money, too. But in one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries it is not hard to find willing recipients of cash.\n\nMoldovan investigators admit they cannot identify the source of funds paid into PSB bank \u2013 whether it is Russian state money, private capital or the cash Ilan Shor was convicted of stealing in Moldova. But he himself is very open about his actions and aims. In a typical recent post on TikTok, Shor called for a \u201cfirm NO\u201d to the EU. He then urged followers to choose \u201cthe president I decide on, as someone I can work with\u201d. In return he promised monthly top-up payments of 5,000 Moldovan lei to pensioners, or about \u00a3200. Shor fled Moldova in 2019 and was later sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement. Last year, his party was banned and he is also under Western sanctions, accused of \"malign influence campaigns\" for Russia. Media companies linked to him, Telegram channels and various political groupings have all been blocked. But his message \u2013 anti-EU, sympathetic to Moscow \u2013 still seeps through. Some remain receptive to that, as well as the cash.\n\nDeputy governor of Gagauzia spoke openly of his scorn for the EU\n\nThe deputy governor of Gagauzia, a small autonomous region of southern Moldova, also happens to respect Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tells me that is because he likes strong leaders who he thinks \"put their country first\". Russia\u2019s war on neighbouring Ukraine changed nothing on that score. He admires former US President Donald Trump for the same reason, whilst his scorn for the EU \u2013 which recently placed him under sanctions for \"destabilising activities\" \u2013 mainly focuses on LGBT rights, which he opposes virulently. Later, when I ask passers-by in the regional capital Comrat about the EU referendum, several reply that they\u2019ll vote \"no\" in order to keep \"gay parades\" from their town.\n\nA sign for the pro-Russian Victory party in Comrat, Gagauzia\n\nPro-Russian views and Kremlin-led narratives have always been strong in Gagauzia, where many still watch Russian state TV channels despite a national ban. Lately, Shor has been investing heavily here. The deputy governor repeatedly refers to him as \u201cour political leader\u201d and shrugs off the criminal conviction as if it were political. \u201cTry and say a bad word here about Ilan Shor and people will spit at you!\u201d, Uzun declares as we drive down Lenin Street past a statue of the Russian revolutionary, a little grubby but still intact. Many shop signs, those not in the local Gagauz language, are in Russian. I hear how Shor pays top-up pensions to 30,000 people in the region as well as re-tarmacking some 50 km (31 miles) of roads between remote villages, which we see. \u201cAll he does is for the people,\u201d Uzun enthuses.\n\nThe anti-corruption prosecutor later clarifies that using donations for social spending is not a crime. But channelling Shor\u2019s funds to political parties is an offence \u2013 and Uzun\u2019s boss, regional governor Evghenia Gutul, has been charged with that. After a while we roll up to a children\u2019s fairground. \u201cLook at Gagauziyaland, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Uzun beams, leading the way beneath a giant rainbow into a deserted but brand-new park.\n\nGagauziyaland, a children's playground, was almost deserted during our visit\n\nThe wind is bitterly cold and the mini dragon roller-coaster and merry-go-round we are looking at both stand empty and still. But Uzun insists people in Gagauzia will vote \u201chow Shor tells them\u201d - not for money, but because they trust him. \u201cAll the talk, that he\u2019s an arm of the Kremlin, destabilising Moldova: that\u2019s absolutely not true. This is the truth: what you see here,\u201d he waves towards the frozen fairground.\n\nWomen in traditional Moldovan dress welcomed President Maia Sandu at a campaign event on Friday\n\nOn Friday, Moldova\u2019s election campaign reached its climax. Maia Sandu was met for her own final rally in the small town of Telenesti, where women in traditional dress sang and supporters clapped as she passed. She has not taken part in election debates and did not want to speak to the BBC. But addressing a couple of hundred people through a microphone, Sandu urged Moldovans to vote for her and for the EU as the best path to peace. \u201cThis has been a very difficult campaign with a lot of lies and dirty money,\u201d she told them, asking voters to \u201cput our country out of harm\u2019s way\u201d and prevent her opponents \u201cderailing Moldova from its European path\u201d. That path has been a bumpy one for many years, with multiple diversions. Still, Moldova had already made its choice and opened accession talks with the EU. Now a referendum that Sandu initiated in an attempt to reinforce that goal and bolster her own support has turned into a risky political move. It looks like the presidential ballot is not the only vote she has to worry about on Sunday.",
    "Flies, rats and offers of hush money - the price of living next to a \u2018monster\u2019 incinerator\n\nGeorge and Mandy are among the residents who refused to sign an NDA agreement and can speak about the Runcorn incinerator\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with flies, rats, smell, noise. It's just been horrendous,\u201d says Mandy Royle, who lives in the closest home to the UK\u2019s biggest waste incinerator at Runcorn in Cheshire. The facility generates electricity from burning nearly a million tonnes of household rubbish every year - but much of that waste doesn't come from Ms Royle's local area. Like many incinerators, deliveries come from hundreds of miles away. BBC analysis suggests the burden of the UK's waste is disproportionately falling on deprived areas such as Runcorn, which are 10 times more likely to have an energy-from-waste incinerator in their midst than in the wealthiest areas.\n\nMany families nearby shared a \u00a31m settlement after 180 of them launched a legal action over the pollution and disturbances from the Runcorn incinerator, the BBC can reveal. But Ms Royle was one of a handful of people who did not sign the agreement, allowing her to speak out about life in the shadow of one of the UK's giant waste plants. \u201cI\u2019m just stuck in this little corner with a big monster staring at me and throwing what it does over me,\u201d she says. The others who took the cash, worth about \u00a34,500 per family after legal costs, had to sign a strict non-disclosure agreement (NDA). \u201cWell, I think they\u2019re being unfair in what they're paying, and completely unfair in what they are doing,\u201d says George Parker, who runs a local garage and also refused to sign the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a million-pound hush fund and a gagging order. That's why they're doing it, they\u2019re keeping everybody quiet.\u201d\n\nViridor, which runs the Runcorn plant, said it would not comment on the settlement or on the non-disclosure agreement. It said that noise and odour remained within permitted levels - regulated by the Environment Agency - and any complaints were fully investigated with feedback provided to residents.\n\nEnergy-from-waste incinerators have boomed over the past decade as local councils have faced higher charges to bury rubbish in landfill sites. This shift, though, has come at a big cost to the environment, with a BBC investigation showing that these plants now produce as much carbon per unit of energy than as if they were burning coal. It also comes at a cost to those who live near them, say Ms Royle and Mr Parker. \u201cThey put them in deprived areas, so people won\u2019t complain because they know the majority of the people are in such a state they don\u2019t know how to complain basically,\u201d Mr Parker says.\n\nOur investigation found breaches of air quality controls increased both at Runcorn and across incinerators in England between 2019 and 2023. These controls restrict the levels of gases such as carbon monoxide that can be emitted. The number of these permit breaches has risen from an average of 3.4 in 2019 to 5.5 per incinerator in 2023. Last year 73% of facilities in England reported transgressions. Runcorn\u2019s energy-from-waste site breached its permit 17 times in the past five years. \u201cThe Runcorn Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) operates within a strict Environmental Permit and is heavily regulated by the Environment Agency, meaning it must comply with all the necessary regulations and permit conditions,\u201d Viridor said in a statement. \u201cShould a permit limit be exceeded, a full and thorough investigation into the cause is carried out.\u201d Household waste is also being sent hundreds of miles across the country to be burned, or even sent abroad, BBC analysis of UK council data showed.\n\nResidents who live near the Runcorn incinerator have been psychologically impacted, says food bank manager Eddie Thompson\n\nIn one of the worst examples, waste from Derby City Council and Derbyshire Council ended up at 19 different incinerators in one year - from Milton Keynes to North Yorkshire. The increased movement of waste by train and lorry is producing even more carbon emissions and worsening local air pollution. A spokesperson for Derby City Council and Derbyshire County Council said the councils had signed a new contract which will reduce this number to 13, and that \u201creducing waste miles is a key part of our strategy.\u201d In another case, County Durham sent 1,300 tonnes of waste last year to an undisclosed incinerator facility in Cyprus, even though there are incinerators nearby in north-west England. The council said it was \"standard industry practice to divert waste from landfill through energy-from-waste facilities\".\n\nWhile Runcorn is home to the UK\u2019s biggest incinerator, a significant proportion of the town\u2019s local rubbish is not burned at the site. Instead, some of the waste from the borough of Halton, where Runcorn is located, and from other Merseyside towns, is sent by train about 150 miles across the country to the east coast, to be burned on Teesside. This whole area along the River Tees has emerged as a UK hotspot for energy-from-waste. The region is now home to three active incinerators, with three more in various stages of planning. \u201cWe have become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s rubbish by stealth,\u201d says an independent councillor in Redcar, Dr Tristan Learoyd. He says that incinerators in the area are tied into long-term contracts with councils across the country, which he believes will see large amounts of carbon emitted every year for decades to come. \u201cThere's a potential here for the number of incinerators to be in double figures,\u201d he says. \u201cFor my hometown, which has suffered a massive decline over the years, it's just another kick in the face. We're becoming the rubbish backyard of England.\u201d Linda Martin lives on the nearest street to the Wilton 11 incinerator in Billingham, Teesside, which burns more than 400,000 tonnes of rubbish every year. She questions whether people in the locality are seeing any direct economic benefit from the facility.\n\nDo you ever think about what happens to your rubbish after it\u2019s been taken away? Most of what we chuck in the bin is actually being burnt for energy. The BBC has found there's been a rapid rise in the burning of rubbish across the UK in recent years with major implications for the environment. For the 5 Questions On podcast, science reporter Esme Stallard explains.\n\n\u201cThis is our home and our area. Why should we have to put up with everything that we're putting up with?\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, we hear the noise constantly. We've got double glazing in, but it don't work. You still hear the noise!\u201d For Eddie Thompson MBE, who runs a busy food bank in Runcorn, the psychological impact of locating large-scale incinerators in poor areas is very important. \u201cMentally, people feel as though, in some cases, they are worthless. They have no sense of a future that they can see ahead of them. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Viridor, but are we getting it right?

    "Flood fears as Storm Bert heads into second day\n\nDrivers are being advised to be aware of surface water on the roads\n\nParts of Scotland are bracing for a second day of disruption with high winds and localised flooding after Storm Bert swept heavy snow and rain across the country. The central belt was hit by more snow than anticipated early on Saturday, causing widespread problems on the roads. The M8 saw long traffic jams and two of the main routes south - the M74 and A68 - were closed for a time due to accidents. Regional flood alerts have also been issued for parts of Dumfries and Galloway, west Borders, Central, Tayside, Aberdeenshire, Dundee and Angus regions. A yellow weather warning for wind in the Highlands and Argyll and Bute will come into place from 12:00.\n\nFlood warnings, external urging people to \"act now\" are also in place for four areas including the Churchill Barriers in Orkney, Strath Oykel in Sutherland and at the Carse of Lennoch and Crieff in Tayside.\n\nTraffic was diverted to the Forth Road Bridge from the Queensferry Crossing\n\nIn an unusual move, the Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth was closed due to the threat of falling ice on Saturday. Traffic in the area was diverted via the Forth Road Bridge. The diversion remained in place until 01:00 on Sunday. David Bishop from the national road maintenance body Bear Scotland said the closure was due to concerns that ice sticking to the bridge's 70km of cable stays could fall and cause a \"significant road traffic incident\". It is the first time since 2021 the bridge has closed. All 700 buses in the Lothian Buses fleet ground to a halt for much of Saturday due to tough road conditions. The company announced services were back to normal early on Saturday evening. Edinburgh sightseeing buses were cancelled and there was disruption on Citylink, McGill's and First services. A dramatic image shared on social media showed a bus which had left the road at Buchlyvie, a village in the Stirling area.\n\nThere were accidents across the road network as drivers struggled with the poor conditions\n\nGeorge Henry, head of road safety and road policy for Transport Scotland, said the conditions had been \"challenging\". He said: \"We have been treating our roads around the clock, our operating companies have been out and we have used over 240 gritters. \"Unfortunately there has been some impacts with various vehicles being stuck due to some vehicles losing traction at various location and we\u2019ve tried to treat that as quickly as we can to minimise the disruption to the motoring public.\"\n\nMr Henry said particular incidents had impacted the M8 near Livingston and the M74 at various points on Saturday. He added attention is now turning to the risk of localised flooding caused by the temperature rising and snow melting. \"There will be lots of surface water so we urge the motoring public when they are returning to the roads to please take care and drive to the conditions they are faced with,\" he added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA total of 11 SPFL games were called off with kick-off times delayed on another three, including two in the Premiership. One of those called off was a league two match between Cove Rangers and Stenhousemuir, after the away team's bus got stuck in snow at Broxden Services outside Perth. Over 3,000 homes in England and Wales are without power. Scotland has not been hit as hard, with both Scottish Power and SSE reporting just a few localised faults. The Met Office has warned a rapid thaw and subsequent rain may cause further disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain and snow remained in place for most of Scotland until 09:00 on Sunday. The Highlands and Argyll and Bute will see winds of up to 65mph on Sunday, with a yellow warning in place from 12:00 until 00:00.

    "Tony Chambers, pictured with members of his legal team, did not contact the police for almost a year after first being made aware of concerns about Lucy Letby\n\nThe former chief executive of the hospital where Lucy Letby murdered seven babies said the father of the serial killer \"made threats\" in \"angry meetings\". Tony Chambers was in charge at the Countess of Chester hospital during 2015 and 2016, when the nurse also attempted to murder seven other infants. Mr Chambers told the public inquiry into the circumstances around Letby's offending that he and his fellow board members \"simply didn't see\" what was behind the rising death rate amongst babies on the neonatal unit. He also apologised to the families of Letby's victims \"for the pain that may have been prolonged by any decisions or actions that I took in good faith\".\n\nNicholas de la Poer KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Chambers about meetings he held with Letby and her family in December 2016. This came after managers upheld a grievance she had lodged with the hospital in September that year, about being removed from the neonatal unit and placed onto clerical duties due to accusations against her by senior consultants.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Telling Letby 'we've got your back' was 'clumsy' says ex-hospital boss\n\nThe Thirlwall Inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall heard that during that meeting, Mr Chambers told Letby she would be returning to the unit and accepted saying to her: \"For your resilience Lucy, you astound me.\u201d He said Letby's father, John Letby, wanted to report the consultants who accused his daughter of harming babies to the regulator the General Medical Council (GMC). \"Letby\u2019s father was very angry, he was making threats,\" he said. \"He was making threats that would have made an already difficult situation even worse by threatening GMC referrals for the doctors. \"He was threatening guns to my head.\"\n\nJohn and Susan Letby, the parents of Lucy Letby, demanded action against the doctors who suspected the serial killer of harming babies\n\nMr Chambers said he felt he had \"perhaps\" not handled that meeting well but said he was trying to \"take the heat out\u201d of the situation with Letby\u2019s father. At one meeting, Letby demanded any mention of her being taken off the unit be removed from her personnel file, and said she wanted \"four apologies\" from the consultants who had raised suspicions about her. Mr de la Poer asked: \"Would you agree that this was deeply manipulative behaviour?\" Mr Chambers replied: \"I didn\u2019t feel that I was being manipulated at the time.... \"It was the father who seemed to be pulling the strings rather than Letby herself.\" He accepted he told her \"don't worry Lucy, we've got your back\", which he said in hindsight was \"clumsy language\".\n\nWeekly updates from the public inquiry examining the murders committed by Lucy Letby\n\nHe also told her a review of neonatal mortality by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in September 2016 had \"vindicated\" her. Mr Chambers told the inquiry he accepts the RCPCH review did not vindicate Letby because it had not investigated any link between her and the deaths - although he said it did not indicate anything suspicious. \"I was very conscious to try as much as possible to avoid further escalation particularly from her father\", he said. Mr de la Poer asked: \"If it was an attempt by Lucy Letby to take control and get what she wanted, and go on the offensive, she succeeded in recruiting you to that. Mr Chambers said: \"No I don\u2019t think so at all\", adding that he believed Letby just wanted to \"get back to the job she loved\".\n\nLucy Letby was allowed to work on the unit for one more day after chief executive Tony Chambers first learned of concerns about her\n\nEarlier the inquiry heard that Mr Chambers held a meeting with consultant paediatricians on 29 June 2016, which, he said, was the first time he had been told there were concerns about Letby's links to unexplained deaths and collapses of babies. He told the inquiry the concerns about Letby were \"very shocking\" to hear, but that \"we wouldn't jump to criminality as the causal factor\". Mr Chambers said: \"There was strong rebuttal to the proposition that this one nurse was deliberately causing harm. \"There was a very strong level of support for this individual.\" Letby was due to go on leave for a fortnight after 30 June and afterwards was placed onto clerical duties, never returning to the unit. Mr de la Poer asked about a meeting on 27 March 2017, when consultant Dr Stephen Brearey told Mr Chambers the police should be called in. Mr Chambers said that at that meeting the agreement was made to contact police, but he did not write to the chief constable of Cheshire Constabulary until 2 May, after consulting with criminal barrister Simon Medland QC. However, Mr de la Poer suggested that, in his initial contact with the police, Mr Chambers \"did not present the case at its highest\" and was trying to \"discourage\" an investigation. Mr Chambers responded \"absolutely not\", and said the hospital \"shared with police very openly and candidly what we genuinely believed to be the position as we understood it at the time\".",

    "Alleged spy 'talked about going to Iran for training', court hears\n\nA former British army soldier who is accused of being a spy for Iran and escaping from Wandsworth Prison last year offered to go for training in Iran, a court heard. The jury at his Woolwich Crown Court trial heard the recording of a conversation that the prosecution said was between Daniel Khalife and two Iranian contacts in November 2021. Mr Khalife, now 23, is accused of gathering information for Iran, compiling a list of special forces soldiers, perpetrating a bomb hoax and escaping prison. He denies all the charges.\n\nIn the recording, Mr Khalife apparently discusses with the two men whether he should travel to Iran or to Lebanon. One of the men, who seems to be the more senior, suggests that Lebanon is the better option. Mr Khalife then says: \"I wanted to have some training from you guys, and I think the best training for me is inside of Iran.\" But the man, speaking with a strong Iranian accent, says Lebanon is better: \"Yes, there we can train you and because we have a safe place there - yes.\" \"Your safety and healthiness is much important for us,\" he says. The man adds: \"We don\u2019t want any dangers for you and the planning for Lebanon. If this is better, if this is good we can plan a safe meeting here.\" Mr Khalife says he is about to have a month\u2019s holiday starting in mid-December. His Iranian contact asks: \"This is not sensitive for you travelling to Lebanon?\" Mr Khalife says: \"It is sensitive. I have to plan. I can\u2019t pay with my credit card. So what I have to do is pay in cash. I will use the money that you gave me.\" The prosecution said the recording of the conversation was recovered from Mr Khalife\u2019s own iPad. There is no evidence that Mr Khalife ever travelled to Iran or Lebanon. Earlier, the jury were read transcripts of two conversations Mr Khalife had with MI5 call handlers after he phoned their publicly available phone number. In the first call, he said he had been approached by an Iranian man and that he had started sending them fabricated documents. He said that he had collected a sum of money in \u00a320 notes in a dog poo bag from Mill Hill Park in North London, and said a year later he had collected \u00a31,000 pounds from under a pot in a cemetery in Kensal Green in West London. In the next call, he questions why he has not received a call back.\n\nIn court yesterday, prosecutors said Mr Khalife - whose role in the Royal Corps of Signals gave him access to highly sensitive information - had offered to work as an agent for Iran in messages to Iranian intelligence handlers. The court also heard that he won a cup for Best Junior Soldier in his squadron, and was recommended for promotion to Lance Corporal aged just 20.\n\nThe jury has heard that Mr Khalife was first arrested in January 2022, and charged in January 2023. He is alleged to have escaped from Wandsworth prison eight months later by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery van before being recaptured after three days.",

    "Salmond's body to be brought home on private flight\n\nA private individual is paying for a charter flight to bring Alex Salmond\u2019s body back to Scotland from North Macedonia. The former first minister died suddenly from a heart attack in the Balkan country on Saturday at the age of 69. There had been calls for an RAF flight to repatriate his body, but it is now confirmed a private charter flight - paid for independently - will fly to Aberdeen. A private family funeral will be held for the Alba Party leader, followed by a public memorial event at a later date.\n\nNo timeline for Salmond's repatriation has been publicly announced but the Alba Party said details would be made available in due course.\n\nActing Alba Party leader Kenny MacAskill said Salmond\u2019s family were \u201cgrateful\u201d to the private citizen who had chartered the flight. He said: \u201cIt brings a great deal of comfort to Moira and other members of the family to know that he will soon be home with them. \"The family have asked that their privacy be respected at this time and will be making an announcement in due course about the funeral arrangements and a memorial service to honour the life of Alex Salmond.\" The statement also thanked the North Macedonian government for expediting the process of releasing his body and both the Scottish and UK governments for their \u201cendeavours\u201d to put plans in place. The Scottish government said it had been a \"complex\" process. A spokesperson said: \u201cOver the last few days the Scottish government and UK government have been engaging with Alex Salmond\u2018s family and working closely together in accordance with their wishes, to ensure the swift and dignified repatriation of the former first minister to Scotland. \u201cHaving explored a number of options, the family have now made arrangements for this to take place with the support of a private citizen.\"\n\nThere is a book of condolence at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh\n\nFriends of Salmond, including the Conservative MP David Davis, had been lobbying the UK government to allow the RAF to fly his body to Scotland. Such arrangements are usually reserved for members of the Royal Family. Chris McEleny, general secretary of the Alba Party, had called on the UK government to allow Salmond's body to be flown directly back to Scotland as it would be quicker than using a commercial flight. He told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"For all that he\u2019s done for Scotland, I think it\u2019s the least that we can do for him.\" Salmond had been attending an Academy for Cultural Diplomacy (ACD) event in Ohrid on Saturday when he took unwell.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nACD director Mark Donfried said he had returned to North Macedonia from his home in Germany to help ensure Salmond was repatriated as soon as possible. He told BBC Scotland News: \"I was taught as a I grew up you don't leave any man behind and, here, I definitely feel a responsibility to make sure that everything goes perfectly with the highest level of respect.\" Tributes have been paid to former SNP leader Salmond from across the political spectrum in recent days. During Prime Ministers' Questions, Sir Keir Starmer described him as a \"monumental figure in Scottish and UK politics\". Tory leader Rishi Sunak and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey also paid tribute in the Commons. Scotland football fans held a minute's applause before Tuesday's match against Portugal at Hampden.",
    "Emma and James Richardson say they found themselves \"haemorrhaging money\" after buying a holiday home\n\nWhen James and Emma Richardson bought a \u00a3110,000 caravan at a holiday park in Lincolnshire, they hoped it would benefit their whole family. The couple, from Cleethorpes, used money left to Mrs Richardson by her parents \u2013 who died in 2017 and 2018 \u2013 to put down a \u00a325,000 deposit and entered into a finance agreement to pay for the rest. They wanted to let relatives use the caravan at Tattershall Lakes for free holidays and also rent it out to the public to offset the cost. Mrs Richardson, 43, said: \"I wanted to do something for the family. It was my way of being able to have them gain from me inheriting. \u201cMum and Dad were very hard-working, very loving. Family was everything.\"\n\nThe Richardsons said a Tattershall Lakes salesperson assured them they would make enough income from hiring out their caravan to cover their monthly finance repayments of \u00a31,269. Away Resorts, which runs the park and manages rentals, denies any such promise was made. A spokesperson told the BBC the company was clear with caravan owners that \"there are no guarantees\" about subletting income. The Richardsons said they found themselves \"haemorrhaging money\" after buying their caravan. \u201cWe had months where we were taking \u00a31,200 in rental costs, but we would only receive \u00a3200 of that because of linen charges, [visitor] passes, cleaning fees,\u201d said Mr Richardson, 46. \u201cWe were so far short of what we were sold.\u201d\n\nEmma and James Richardson lost more than \u00a350,000 over two years\n\nThe couple soon decided to cut their losses and offered to sell their caravan back to the park. After this offer was rejected, the Richardsons paid \u00a320,000 and handed over their caravan to get out of their third-party finance agreement. \"We lost, over a period of two years, in excess of \u00a350,000, which has just crippled us,\" Mr Richardson said. \u201cI'm still paying credit cards off now. We've lost that inheritance that our parents worked all their lives for.\u201d Mrs Richardson said losing the money her parents had left was a \u201cbitter pill to swallow\u201d. She added: \u201cIf it was just my money it would be completely different, but because it\u2019s what my parents worked for\u2026 I felt like I\u2019d let them down.\"\n\nSkipsea in East Yorkshire is home to hundreds of holiday caravans\n\nSince a boom in the 1960s, caravan holidays at Britain's seaside resorts and rural beauty spots have been a popular choice among families looking for an affordable getaway. Today there are more than 3,000 parks across the UK. Caravan and camping holidays brought \u00a37.2bn into the economy last year, according to industry figures. The British Holiday and Home Parks Association (BHHPA), the national trade body for the sector, says these sites bring \"vital tourism\" and investment \"to some of the UK\u2019s most economically challenged areas\". The National Caravans Council (NCC), which also represents the industry, said there were \"many thousands of happy holiday caravan owners across the UK\". But the Richardsons are not the only family to feel they have been left out of pocket by the dream of owning a holiday home. Dozens of people have told the BBC they lost significant sums of money \u2013 some of them their life savings, pensions or inheritance \u2013 after buying a static caravan. The founder of a group set up to support caravan owners said it was \"scandalous\" that \"people's lives are being ruined\".\n\nAndrew and Sue Dawson bought a static caravan at a holiday park on the East Yorkshire coast in 2022, they planned to spend their retirement whiling away weekends at the seaside with their daughters and grandchildren. Then they received some devastating news. In February this year, Mr Dawson, 59, was diagnosed with incurable cancer. \"The doctors gave me between six months and \u2013 as they described it \u2013 a few short years,\" he said. \"Obviously we started talking about the future. It completely changed everything.\" The couple, from Leeds, began getting their affairs in order and decided to sell their caravan at Parkdean's Skipsea Sands resort. But they were in for another shock. The three-bedroom caravan with decking, for which they had paid \u00a362,400 in 2022, was worth just \u00a317,000 two years later. \u201cWe were gobsmacked,\u201d said Mr Dawson. \u201cNo one ever told us we\u2019d face that level of depreciation. \"The salesman sold us the dream, but didn't sell us the reality.\"\n\nAndrew and Sue Dawson enjoyed spending time with their granddaughters at Skipsea Sands\n\nParkdean\u2019s website states that \u201cbuying a holiday home isn't considered a financial investment, as holiday homes depreciate in value with age\u201d. But Mr Dawson said a Skipsea Sands salesperson told him caravans \"pretty much hold their value\". Only when the Dawsons came to sell, following the cancer diagnosis, did they realise they could recoup only a fraction of their expenditure. The couple reluctantly agreed to sell their caravan back to the park for \u00a317,000 after negotiating with the sales team. But on the day the Dawsons cleared out their caravan to finalise the sale, Parkdean cut the price they were willing to pay to \u00a316,000.\n\nAndrew Dawson was diagnosed with stage four cancer in February\n\nMr Dawson said his dealings with the park had been \"dreadful\". \"The amount of money we've lost and the way we\u2019ve been treated, in my opinion is very underhanded and lacking in transparency,\" he added. He said he felt there had been \"a complete lack of empathy, really, knowing my condition, knowing why were selling \u2013 that we didn't really have a lot of choice\". \"We feel they let us down very badly.\"\n\nThe Dawsons paid \u00a362,000 for their caravan with additional decking\n\nAfter the BBC contacted Parkdean, a Skipsea Sands manager called Mr Dawson and offered to pay him \u00a31,000 to resolve the dispute. A Parkdean spokesperson said the company was \"aware of and sympathetic to Andrew\u2019s situation\" and had contacted Mr Dawson \"to agree a suitable offer and settle the matter\". But Mr Dawson said it was \"never about the money,\" adding: \"It doesn't change my view on Parkdean and it doesn't change my view on the industry.\"\n\nSally Nicholls, 70, from Sheffield, used her entire pension pot and a small loan to buy a \u00a369,000 static caravan at Tattershall Lakes in 2021. She said she told a salesperson she planned to live off the rental income in her retirement and was given figures indicating what she could expect to make. \u201cAt the time, it looked like a good proposition,\" she added. Ms Nicholls did make a small profit from her caravan in her first year as an owner, but her takings quickly dried up after repeated increases in park charges, which she was forced to pass on to customers. She then found herself in competition with the park itself, which was able to offer more favourable rates, including free access to facilities, to prospective guests. \"That more or less put a complete halt to the bookings coming in,\" Ms Nicholls said.\n\nSally Nicholls sold her house after losing money on a caravan purchase\n\nMs Nicholls decided to sell her caravan but, like the Dawsons, was shocked at how little it was now worth. After Tattershall Lakes declined to buy it back, she ended up selling to an outside trader for \u00a317,500. \u201cIt came as quite a shock to realise that I wasn\u2019t going to get my pension back to live on in old age,\" said Ms Nicholls, who has since sold her house to free up funds for her retirement and moved to a smaller property in Bolsover. \"I had to consider what I was going to live on,\" she added. \"The only option for me was to sell my home.\" Away Resorts said it provided all prospective buyers with \u201ccomprehensive information, including detailed terms and conditions\u201d to ensure they had \u201cfull awareness of the potential risks and rewards\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cWhile subletting a holiday home can be a way for some owners to generate additional income, we make it clear that there are no guarantees in relation to this, as various factors \u2013 including seasonal demand and wider economic conditions \u2013 can influence returns.\u201d\n\nIbraheem Dulmeer, a barrister who specialises in holiday park law, said caravan buyers were not always fully informed about the agreements they were signing. He said it was \"really, really essential\" buyers did \"due diligence\" and got any promises from salespeople in writing. \u201cMany people from the outset are not provided with any legal advice or don\u2019t obtain any legal advice, they simply go through shaking hands, handing over large sums of money,\" Mr Dulmeer added. \"And what seems to happen is that, as a result of that, they aren\u2019t actually afforded the opportunity to review the terms, review the conditions, and see whether it fits for them. And that\u2019s where most of the problems really stem from.\"\n\nThe BHHPA, which represents holiday parks, said it was important consumers \"read the small print\" and \"fully understand the sales contract\" before committing to buying a caravan. A spokesperson for the NCC, the trade organisation for the industry, said holiday caravan ownership was \"a significant purchase decision\" and potential buyers should conduct their own research to \"fully understand what they are buying\". They added: \"We work with our member parks to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities to help consumers understand clearly what they are buying, when and how they can use their holiday caravan or lodge, and that they treat all customers fairly and honestly using simple language and following best practice.\" Caravan owners are protected by consumer rights laws, which are enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and local Trading Standards offices. The CMA, a government regulator, told the BBC it could not comment on specific cases, but said businesses must not mislead their customers and any claims about products \"must be honest and transparent\".\n\nLast year, a petition signed by more than 27,000 people, which called for protections to be strengthened, was rejected by the Conservative government. The petition was started by the Holiday Park Action Group, which has more than 66,000 members in a Facebook group in which caravan buyers voice complaints. Its founder Carole Keeble said consumers were \"consistently misled in respect of the true value of the caravans they are buying\" and claimed the CMA was failing to act. She told the BBC it was a \"national scandal that people are losing their pensions, inheritance or having to sell their own homes to cover the losses they are incurring\". Meanwhile, Ms Nicholls said she wanted a regulator to \"step up and take control\" of the sector. She added: \"It's had a devastating impact on me.

    "Online fraudsters are selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies, the Daily Express reports\n\nThe build-up to next week's budget continues to lead many of the papers. The Daily Telegraph, external says Chancellor Rachel Reeves' plan to change the government's fiscal rules will \"unleash a borrowing spree of up to \u00a350bn\". The Daily Mail s, externalays the figure equates to \u00a31,750 per household. The shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is quoted saying the plan risks pushing up interest rates and \"punishing families with mortgages\". Writing in the Financial Times, external, Reeves says \"guardrails\" will be in place to ensure prudent spending. There's also a warning for Reeves at the prospect of imposing national insurance on employers' pension contributions - a policy that could raise \u00a315bn. In a letter to the Times, external, former work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett describes the potential measure as \"very worrying\" because it could lead to employers reducing pension contributions. That would come at a time when the government's own figures show four in ten private sector workers are not saving enough for an adequate income in retirement. The proposed ban on smoking in pub gardens is, according to the Sun, external, \"running out of puff\" and on the verge of being dropped. The paper says smoking is now only to be prohibited outside schools and hospitals. The Guardian reports, external that there was \"fierce opposition from the hospitality trade\" to the plan. No 10 officials also privately believe banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is an \"unserious policy\" and not backed by good evidence to show non-smokers are harmed. \"Time to listen\", is the message from the Daily Mirror, external on the subject of the UK paying reparations for its role in the slave trade. But the Daily Telegraph's editorial , externalsays there is \"no case\" for Britain to answer - and such demands for cash \"stand on shaky moral ground\". The Daily Mail's, external editorial takes aim at the prime minister's handling of the row. It says \"canny politicians\" from elsewhere in the Commonwealth - who are \"astute at spotting the weakest link\" - appear to have outsmarted him by securing a debate on reparations.\n\nAn investigation by the Daily Express, external has found online fraudsters are ripping off the Royal British Legion's annual appeal by selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies. One website reportedly bragged that its produce was \"suitable for Remembrance Day activities... to honour the lives and memories of fallen soldiers\". The shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, has described the rip off merchants as \"disgraceful\". The Royal British Legion has urged people to only buy poppies from its trusted sellers.

    "The government has ordered a review of physician associates (PA) and anaesthesia associates (AA) in England after mounting concern about their use in the NHS. The number of PAs and AAs, who help doctors, are in the process of being rapidly expanded. But the British Medical Association has voiced concerns they are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and the lines with doctors are getting blurred. Announcing the review, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said there were legitimate concerns that needed looking at but he also criticised the \"toxic nature of the debate\", saying it had left PAs feeling demoralised.\n\nThe review will look at how they are being deployed and what safeguards are needed going forward. Streeting said: \"Many physician associates are providing great care and freeing up doctors to do the things only doctors can do. \"But there are legitimate concerns over transparency for patients, scope of practice, and the substituting of doctors. \"These concerns have been ignored for too long, leading to a toxic debate where physicians feel ignored and PAs feel demoralised.\" He said he hoped the review would \"take the heat out of the issue\" and make sure \"we get the right people, in the right place, doing the right thing\u201d. The review will be led by Prof Gillian Leng, a former chief executive of the NHS drugs advisory body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It will report back early next year to inform the government\u2019s new 10-year plan for the NHS.\n\nThe current NHS workforce plan sees PAs and AAs as a crucial part of the staffing mix in the health service. The numbers have been gradually increasing in recent years, but the plan, published last year, called for a rapid expansion from just over 3,000 to 12,000 by 2036. PAs can work in GP surgeries and hospitals. They are not authorised to prescribe, but they can order some scans, take medical histories and conduct physical examinations. AAs, which support surgery teams, are a much smaller group - there are only about 100 in the NHS. Both PAs and AAs have to complete a two-year master\u2019s degree. They usually need a bioscience-related first degree, but that is not a prerequisite. British Medical Association leader Dr Phil Banfield called for the rollout of new PAs to be paused while the review takes place. And he added: \"The NHS must tell us how they are going to keep patients safe while this review is carried out. \u201cYou do not fly a plane under safety review, you ground it.\" Last week the BBC reported on the death of 77-year-old Susan Pollitt who died in 2023 at Royal Oldham Hospital after a drain was mistakenly left in her abdomen for too long. The inquest into her death concluded it had been caused by an \"unnecessary medical procedure contributed to by neglect\". She received treatment from a PA alongside other staff. Following Mrs Pollitt\u2019s inquest, North Manchester coroner Joanne Kearsley warned about the use of PAs. She said there was a lack of regulation and national framework covering training, supervision and competency, and limited understanding and awareness about the role among both patients and other NHS staff. She also said the lack of a distinct uniform and the title \"physician\" was giving rise to confusion as to whether the practitioner is a doctor.\n\nThe issue of regulation should be addressed next month when the General Medical Council starts regulating PAs and AAs. In September, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which has been broadly supportive of the expansion of the role, accepted a review was needed given the concerns being expressed. But the academy was critical of the \"increasingly acrimonious and destructive debate\" which it said had been fuelled by unsubstantiated comments on social media and was damaging teamwork across the health service. Stephen Nash, head of United Medical Associate Professionals, which represents PAs, said the review would be a chance to \"shine a real light\" on what is going on and provided much needed evidence in a \"very one-sided debate\". Louise Ansari, head of patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said she welcomed the review too. She said patients had reported \"very positive\" interactions with PAs, but she had particular concerns about the fact patients were not always told or made aware they were being seen by a PA.\n\nAre you a PA, AA or a doctor who has been affected?

    "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk. Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said. Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.\n\nThere are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand. Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended. \"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\". Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\". The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\". It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high. However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year. Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024. For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can. But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.\n\nStellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it. Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary. Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection. Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans. Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation. It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton. But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\". \u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said. Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932. At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued. Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.\n\nFactory workers in the engine production line at the Vauxhall car plant in Luton in 1954\n\nNissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\". Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs. The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable. Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\". The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\". The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\".\n\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?",

    "Workers could get right to strike for a year\n\nThe government is considering giving workers twice as long to strike. Under existing legislation, if workers vote to take industrial action, the mandate expires after six months and unions are required to hold another ballot to extend it. But a consultation document produced by the government said the mandate could be extended to a year. It said due to unions being \"very likely'' win a second ballot, keeping the six-month rule would ''add administrative costs'' to them.\n\nRailway staff, train drivers, doctors and teachers are just some of the groups that have staged walk outs in recent times. The walk outs across different sectors and industries over the past couple of years have resulted in more than 5.7 million working days have been lost, the highest number for more than 30 years, according to official figures. Ministers argue that by making it easier for unions to organise, it would lead to a more co-operative relationship with employers and lessen the need for industrial action. The government is proposing to also abolish the requirement that 50% of a workforce turns out to vote. It is looking to get rid of the rule that for \"important public services\" such as the NHS, some 40% of the workforce must have voted in favour of industrial action for it to go ahead. The BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment over the proposals. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, said the government's policies under the Employment Rights Bill were aimed at \"repealing the anti-worker, anti-union laws, and turning the page on industrial relations\". The Employment Rights Bill is a major shake-up of workers' rights, but the reforms proposed are still being worked out and it is still unclear how some will work in practice. Conservative Shadow Business Secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, has urged the government to withdraw the Employment Rights Bill and \"think again\". He said the proposed legislation created \"existential crisis of a magnitude not seen since the pandemic\" for jobs and business people. The government's own analysis released earlier this week said Labour's plans to upgrade workers' rights would cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year to implement.\n\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the union welcomed the government's \"commitment to introduce a modern framework for industrial relations\". Under the bill, the government plans to make to easier for unions to be recognised by employers and companies. A main function of a union is to represent workers in negotiations with their employers over pay and working conditions. At present, 10% of a workforce must be union members for an application to be made to get recognition, but it has been proposed this could be lowered to 2%. Under existing rules, 40% of a workforce must vote in favour of recognition, but under the government's new proposals, that threshold would be abolished. Trade unions have argued that it is too easy for companies to employ extra employees to make it harder for them to reach the required thresholds to be recognised. In July, the GMB trade union lost a vote for recognition at the Amazon Fulfilment Centre in Coventry by 28 votes. The union accused the company of packing out the warehouse with surplus workers in an effort to thwart their bid for recognition. Amazon denied doing so and said it recruited the workers as part of normal business planning.",
    "What happens to Trump\u2019s convictions and legal cases after election win?\n\nTrump is the first person with a felony conviction to serve as president\n\nDonald Trump will be the first president to take office while several criminal cases against him are pending. His ascent to the highest office in the US while facing dozens of criminal charges has left the country in uncharted territory. Many of his legal problems will go away when he steps into the White House. Discussions already have started between Trump's team and the office overseeing federal cases about how to wind those down, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Here's a look at what could happen with each of the four legal challenges he faces.\n\nDonald Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York. A jury of New Yorkers found him guilty of all counts in connection with a hush-money payment made to an adult film star. Judge Juan Merchan pushed back Trump's sentencing from September to 26 November, after the election. He could still go forward with the sentencing as planned despite Trump's win, said former Brooklyn prosecutor Julie Rendelman. But legal experts said it is unlikely that Trump would be sentenced to prison as an older, first-time offender. If he was, his lawyers would appeal the sentence immediately, arguing that jail time would prevent him from conducting official duties and that he should remain free pending the appeal, Ms Rendelman said. \"The appellate process in that scenario could go on for years,\" she said.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith filed criminal charges against Trump last year over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The case has been in legal limbo since the Supreme Court ruled this summer that Trump was partially immune from criminal prosecution over official acts committed while in office. Smith has since refiled his case, arguing Trump's attempts to overturn the election were not related to his official duties. This is one of the cases which could be wound down under current discussions.\n\nAs president-elect, Trump's criminal problems from the case now \"go away\", according to former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. \"It's well established that a sitting president can't be prosecuted, so the election fraud case in DC District Court will be dismissed,\" he said. Mr Rahmani said that if Smith refuses to dismiss the case, Trump can simply get rid of him, as he has pledged to do already. \"I would fire him within two seconds,\" Trump said during a radio interview in October.\n\nSmith also is leading a case against Trump over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House, charges Trump denies. He is accused of storing sensitive documents in his Mar-a-Lago home and obstructing Justice Department efforts to retrieve the files. The judge assigned to the case, Trump-appointee Aileen Cannon, dismissed the charges in July, arguing Smith was improperly appointed by the Justice Department to lead the case. Smith appealed the ruling, but with Trump set to take office, talks are now underway about ending the case. Mr Rahmani said he expects the classified documents case will meet the same fate as the election case. \"The DOJ will abandon its Eleventh Circuit appeal of the dismissal of the classified documents case,\" he said.\n\nTrump is also facing criminal charges in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state. That case has faced a number of hurdles, including efforts to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis over her relationship with a lawyer she hired to work on the case. An appeals court is in the process of weighing whether Willis should be allowed to stay on the case. But now that Trump is the next president, the case could face even more delays, or possibly dismissal. It is expected to be paused during Trump's time in office, according to legal experts. Trump's lawyer Steve Sadow said as much when asked by the judge if Trump could still stand trial if elected. \"The answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\" he said.\n\nIn theory, yes. A president has never pardoned himself before, so the move would be unprecedented. But presidential pardons only apply to federal cases. Trump has only been convicted of 34 state felony charges, so he would not be able to pardon himself in the New York hush-money case.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

She then rang the Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) flood incident helpline to ask for sandbags. \"I made them aware of the situation in the street, the water was coming up the manholes,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\nSarah Kirkwood says she was talking to her neighbours from their upstairs windows while they were stuck inside their houses\n\nMs Kirkwood explained that the area was prone to flooding, but the water had never entered her home before. \"It comes about halfway up the street every year and they've been doing works... so we thought it was all in hand,\" she added. After leaving to get sandbags, Ms Kirkwood arrived back to find her property had flooded, which left her frustrated. Despite the turn of events, Ms Kirkwood said she is \"fortunate\" to have family she can stay with while the damage in her home is dealt with.

The earlier heavy rain combined with snow melt has led to flooding in many areas as rivers burst their banks. Flooding will continue to be a hazard as snow melt feeds down into the river network. According to the Met Office: \"Strong south-westerly winds are expected to develop during Sunday morning across Northern Ireland. \"Gusts of 45-55 mph are expected widely with gusts of up 65 mph possible over hills and exposed locations around the coast.\" The top wind gusts will be similar to those of Saturday and therefore could cause some further damage and disruption.",
    "Met faces service cuts without more cash, says chief\n\nThe boss of the UK's largest police force has warned it faces \"eye-watering cuts\" to services unless ministers increase its funding. Met commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told the BBC he was \"deeply troubled\" by talks so far on its annual settlement for next year. He added that the force was in a \"precarious position\" because previously used options to \"prop up\" its budget were no longer available. The government has said it plans to increase the overall policing budget next year - although allocations by force are still to be negotiated.\n\nThe Met's budget for this year is just over \u00a33.5bn, a 3.5% increase from 2023/24, comprising \u00a32.6bn from central government and \u00a3956m from local taxes. Sir Mark said conversations over its funding allocation from next April - which would normally be expected to be announced in December or January - were still \"ongoing\" with the government and City Hall. But, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, he said he was \"deeply troubled by the situation we appear to be heading towards\". Policing a global capital such as London came with an \"extra set of challenges\", he said, adding that spending per person was lower than in other cities such as New York and Sydney. He said that the \"cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so\" had put the force in a \"more and more precarious position\", and some of its buildings would be \"unusable\" in a few years without further investment. \u201cSome of the things that successive [police] commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out,\" he added. \u201cThe chancellor has been very clear - it's a difficult public sector context.\"\n\n\"You add all those things together, and you get a dramatic change in budgets of a scale that's never going to be absorbed by efficiencies, and is going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to London.\" He added that he was not going to get into detail at this stage on the \"tough choices\" the force would face without an increase in resources. But he said he planned to specify \"10 or 20 things we're going to do differently\" before Christmas. He added that the implications for policing in the capital would \"become more public\" in the coming weeks. The budget for the Home Office is set to shrink by 3.3% next year in real terms, with the bulk of this coming from assumed savings on asylum support. At last month's Budget, the government said it planned to \"increase the core government grant for police forces,\" although it did not specify whether this would be in cash terms or taking account of inflation.

    "UK will not pay out over slavery, says Reeves\n\nRachel Reeves echoed comments by the prime minister, saying that there needed to be a focus on the present and not the past\n\nThe UK is \"not going to be paying out\" reparations for the transatlantic slave trade, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC. Her comments come as diplomatic sources told the BBC that the Commonwealth heads of government are preparing to begin a \"meaningful conversation\" about an issue which could potentially mean the UK owing billions of pounds. The chancellor said she understood why Commonwealth leaders would be making such demands, but it was not something the UK government would commit to. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is attending the summit, said he wanted to discuss current challenges, especially climate change, rather than issues of the past.\n\n\"That's where I'm going to put my focus - rather than what will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations,\" he said. \u201cOf course slavery is abhorrent to everybody; the trade and the practice, there's no question about that. But I think from my point of view\u2026 I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work... on the current future-facing challenges.\u201d\n\u2022 None No UK apology over slavery at Commonwealth summit\n\nThe chancellor reiterated that message in an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We\u2019re not going to be paying out the reparations that some countries are speaking about. \"I understand why they make those demands but that\u2019s not something that this government is doing.\" Commonwealth leaders at the Samoa summit are expected to defy the UK and debate ways of securing reparations for historical slavery. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation. Downing Street insists the issue is not on the agenda for the summit of 56 Commonwealth countries. King Charles is in Samoa for a four-day visit and is due to formally open the summit later with a speech paying tribute to his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the role the Commonwealth played in her life. The King will say how \"all nations are equal in this unique and voluntary association\" which \"is committed to developing free and democratic societies\", and will also speak of the \"existential threat\" of climate change and its impact on Commonwealth nations. He will say that the Commonwealth, thanks to its scale and diversity - representing a third of humanity - can \"discuss the most challenging issues with openness and respect\", and also speak to the importance of recognising and understanding the path of history, and where that may have given rise to contemporary challenges.\n\u2022 None What form could reparations for slavery take?\n\nIn the run-up to this year's summit, there have been growing calls from Commonwealth leaders for the UK to apologise and make reparations worth for the country\u2019s historic role in the slave trade. A report published last year by the University of West Indies - backed by Patrick Robinson, a judge who sits on the International Court of Justice - concluded the UK owed more than \u00a318tn in reparations for its role in slavery in 14 Caribbean countries. Frederick Mitchell, foreign minister of the Bahamas, believes the UK could change its stance and he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \u201cOnce you broach the subject it may take a while for people to come around but come around they will.\" Reparatory justice for slavery can come in many forms, including financial reparations, debt relief, an official apology, educational programmes, building museums, economic support, and public health assistance. On a visit to Kenya last year, the King expressed the \"greatest sorrow and regret\" over the \"wrongdoings\" of the colonial era, but stopped short of issuing an apology, which would have required the agreement of ministers.\n\u2022 None King and Queen arrive in Samoa to red carpet welcome\n\nMr Mitchell told the Commonwealth gathering: \"It\u2019s a simple matter \u2013 it can be done, one sentence, one line.\" He said to the BBC: \"The word is apologise, that\u2019s the word.\" Asked how much reparations should amount to, he said it was not just a matter of money but of \u201crespect, acknowledging the past was a wrong that needs to be corrected\u201d. He said member countries \"want the conversation to start\" but \"there appears to be even a reluctance to have the conversation\". Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said: \u201cReparations are not on the agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. The government\u2019s position has not changed \u2013 we do not pay reparations. \"We are focused on using the summit at [the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] to discuss the shared opportunities which we can unlock across the Commonwealth \u2013 including securing more economic growth.\u201d It is understood the Downing Street position \u2013 that reparatory justice is not on the agenda \u2013 while technically correct, has angered some Caribbean ministers when it was obvious the issue would be discussed at the summit.\n\nSome non-Caribbean countries are not unsympathetic towards the British position and want the summit to focus more on existing challenges - such as climate change, which is adversely affecting many Commonwealth countries, about half of whom are small island states. But all three candidates hoping to be elected this weekend as the next secretary general of the Commonwealth - Shirley Botchwey of Ghana, Joshua Setipa of Lesotho and Mamadou Tangara of Gambia - have made clear they support reparatory justice.\n\u2022 None What form could reparations for slavery take?",
    "Billions at stake in court battle over North Sea oil\n\nProtesters from Greenpeace and Uplift gathered outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh at the start of the case\n\nHow much oil - and how much profit - remain beneath the waters that buffet the British Isles? Going by the number of lawyers packed into the Court of Session in Edinburgh this week, it must be a decent amount. Seven advocates squeezed into the front row of courtroom number one where environmental campaigners are challenging the government's approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields. Behind them, a further three rows were also packed with lawyers, tapping on laptops and scribbling in notebooks. Such an army obviously does not come cheap. Remarkably they all agree on one basic fact - the Rosebank oil field in the Atlantic and the Jackdaw gas development in the North Sea were approved unlawfully. However, the lawyers disagree sharply about what, if anything, should be done about it.\n\nThe person who must decide is Andrew Stewart, better known by his judicial title, Lord Ericht, who is presiding over this judicial review of the UK government's decisions to approve the fields. The previous Conservative administration and the oil and gas regulator consented to Jackdaw in summer 2022, with its owner Shell saying the field would be able to provide gas to 1.4 million British homes.\n\nRosebank, located west of Shetland and estimated to contain between 300 and 500 million barrels of oil, was given the green light the following autumn. Operated by Norwegian state energy giant Equinor and Aberdeen-based Ithaca Energy, it is believed to be the largest untapped field in UK waters and its oil is to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland. Among many other requirements, consent was granted on the basis of environmental impact statements submitted by the companies. As was standard practice at the time, these assessed the climate impact of emissions caused by the process of extracting oil and gas but did not assess the impact of the greenhouse gases which would be released when the fossil fuels were eventually burned, known as downstream emissions. Consent in hand, the owners of the fields raced ahead with work to get ready for drilling, striking deals with suppliers and hiring staff. All week the court has heard repeated references to the vast sums of money that are being spent on the two projects.\n\nEquinor says it will invest \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank and provide employment for 4,000 people\n\nCounsel for Equinor said it was investing \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank, providing employment for 4,000 people. Shell's lawyer said it was investing \u00a31.1bn in the Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea, employing \"at least 1,000\" people between 2023 and 2025. Production is scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27. But this June a victory for climate campaigners in the UK Supreme Court sent a shiver through all three firms and the wider industry. In Finch v Surrey County Council, which involved a dispute about drilling oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the court ruled that an environmental impact assessment must include downstream emissions.\n\nOn the eve of the judicial review, Sarah Finch, the environmental campaigner after whom the Surrey case is named, told me that \"the exact same thing happened at Rosebank.\u201d \u201cIt was granted permission with no assessment of the impact of burning the oil or gas to come out of it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo, a much bigger site, but exactly the same argument.\" The three companies involved in the Court of Session accept the Finch ruling means that, in retrospect, their licences were granted unlawfully. However, they insist they provided all the environmental information required at the time of their applications; they were told by the industry regulator not to assess downstream emissions; and they should not be \"punished\" for a Supreme Court decision which they say they could not have foreseen. Lord Ericht appeared to sum up their position succinctly on Friday, when he suggested it amounted to them asking him to say: \"I accept this decision is unlawful but I give it lawful effect.\" The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift strongly object to any such idea. They disagree that the decision in Finch could not have been predicted with one lawyer suggesting the oil companies had simply lost a bet.\n\nBoth groups now want the judge to pause work on Rosebank and Jackdaw while the fields' downstream emissions are assessed. Then, they argue, the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, and the government's North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), could make a fresh decision about the fields\u2019 licences, armed with a fuller understanding of their contribution to climate change. Even then, there may be a snag. Lawyers for the government, who were also in court, say that in certain circumstances they have doubts that Mr Miliband would have the necessary legal power to revisit the decisions at all. If Mr Miliband does have the power, and if it does come to the crunch, it is not clear what he would do. In court, the UK government's lawyer was reluctant to be drawn on the matter. At times he sounded as if ministers very much wished the whole affair would simply go away. After all, in campaigning against the Tories in the general election this summer, Labour had carefully crafted a policy which appeared designed to minimise controversy, and to avoid becoming dragged into the debate about Rosebank. It went like this - Labour was committed to tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also recognised the importance of the oil and gas industry. As such it would not grant any new exploration licences in UK waters but it would allow existing projects - including Rosebank and Jackdaw - to continue. Ministers spoke of domestic energy production as critical for keeping bills down; helping to ensure the nation's energy security; generating taxes; and for assisting with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Many of those claims are contested by environmentalists.\n\nCampaigners hope Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will be able to make a fresh decision on licensing, but he may not have the legal authority to do so\n\nTessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said 80% of the UK's oil was exported. \"There's no world in which you could have a robust environmental assessment that takes into account those downstream emissions and decide that those environmental impacts are acceptable,\" she told me. In Aberdeen though, the heart of the UK's energy industry, there is a great deal of nervousness about the potential impact of the decision in this case, and about the wider impact of government policy on the sector. Just last week, one US oil firm said it would end all North Sea operations by the end of 2029 because of high levels of taxation.\n\nNow, the eyes of climate campaigners, politicians, and oil companies alike are on Lord Ericht. Perhaps he will find a compromise, for example by allowing the oil firms to proceed with preparatory works - as long as they don\u2019t extract any oil and gas - while at the same time requiring them to provide the government with information on downstream emissions to enable them to revisit the decision. The companies\u2019 lawyers bridled at the suggestion that they were in the business of gambling but, in such a case, maybe they would have little choice but to bet that the politics of pulling the plug would be too painful for Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government. Late on Friday afternoon, the judge retired to consider his decision, a process which could take several weeks or even months. Thanking the many lawyers for their \"excellent contributions,\" he concluded the hearing by saying: \"It's a very difficult matter and it's a very important matter,\" adding, \"I shall issue my judgment in due course.\"",
    "Police in Laos have detained eight members of staff at a backpacker hostel following the deaths of six tourists from suspected methanol poisoning last week. According to local media, those detained include workers and management from the Nana Backpacker Hostel in the town of Vang Vieng, where several of the tourists who later died had stayed. It is unclear how many other people were taken ill and an investigation into the deaths is continuing. The owners of the hostel, which is now closed, have previously denied serving illicit alcohol.\n\nIt is not the first time that police have detained staff from the hostel. The manager was among a number of people who were questioned by police last week. He earlier told the Associated Press, external news agency that 19-year-old Australians Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles were the only people staying at the hostel to have become unwell after drinking free shots before heading out for the night. The pair died days later - after being admitted to hospital in neighbouring Thailand. Theirs were the first deaths suspected to be caused by methanol - a toxic, flavourless and colourless substance commonly added to bootleg alcohol. Two Danish women and a 57-year-old American man, who were also staying at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, died at around the same time. The two young Danes - Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, and Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21 - were found unconscious in their hostel bedroom on 13 November. That was the same day that the Australian women were taken to hospital after going out to a bar in the city the night before, local media reported. They were sent to a hospital in the capital Vientiane, but died in the middle of the night. The medical team said the cause of death was sudden heart failure. Also on 13 November, hostel staff noticed that the American tourist - named as James Louis Hutson - had not come out of his room. When they went to check on him, he was found lying dead on the bed, with several empty drinks glasses nearby. There were no bruises or wounds on his body, local media reported.\n\nSimone White, a 28-year-old London lawyer, also died after she was believed to have ingested methanol while staying in Vang Vieng.\n\u2022 None What is methanol and how does it affect the body? The tourists' deaths have cast a spotlight on the popular backpacking town and spooked tourists, especially women, as five of the six who died were female travellers. Governments including New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, have warned their citizens about drinking spirits in Laos. Some travellers in Vang Vieng are steering clear of the once-popular free shots and alcohol buckets offered to tourists, telling the BBC that they felt concerned about their safety. Methanol poisoning is the most prevalent in Asia, mostly affecting poorer communities and places with weak food regulations and enforcement. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on Tuesday that another Australian, a dual national, may also have become ill from methanol poisoning. A New Zealander who had fallen ill from suspected methanol poisoning in the country has now returned home, authorities have confirmed.",

    "UK reveals father and son at heart of Evil Corp hackers\n\nMaksim Yabubets, his father Viktor and brother Artem are accused of running Evil Corp\n\nThe UK, US and Australia have announced sanctions against 16 people authorities accuse of being part of the most wanted cyber crime gang in the world. Russia-based Evil Corp is accused of stealing around $300m in nearly ten years of hacking. The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) says it can now reveal the gang\u2019s notorious leader, Maksim Yakubets, has been supported by his father Viktor Yakubets - something he had denied when interviewed by the BBC in 2021. The information has been released as part of a large, multinational operation to disrupt Evil Corp and another notorious hacking group called LockBit. Known for their mafia-style of operation, Evil Corp has waged a campaign of destructive cyber-attacks worldwide for over a decade. In 2019, Maksim Yakubets was sanctioned and a $5m bounty was put up for his arrest, along with another man called Igor Turashev. Other Russian individuals, including Yakubets' brother Artem, were also named as part of the US sanctions and designations. In 2021 the BBC travelled to Russia to search for and interview members of the gang to get their side of the story. At a former home of Maksim Yakubets we found his father, who gave an impassioned defence of his son while claiming he was personally innocent. But now the NCA says that Yakubets senior was a major part of the cyber-crime group, accusing him of aiding the gang in laundering some of its stolen funds.\n\nMaksim Yakubets lived what's been described as a playboy lifestyle in Moscow\n\nAs well as the Yakubets family members, Maksim's father-in-law was also sanctioned for helping to protect and coordinate the group with his connections to the Russian security services. Western authorities have now officially linked Eduard Benderskiy, a former high-ranking FSB official, to Evil Corp. \"Maksim Yakubets and his Evil Corp gang has for years lived the archetypal Russian hacker playboy lifestyle seemingly untouchable to law enforcement but today\u2019s announcement shows that we are still watching, digging and determined to disrupt them and bring them to justice,\" said Will Lyne, Head of Cyber Intelligence at the NCA.\n\nAnother of those sanctioned is Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, described by the NCA as the younger Yakubets\u2019 right-hand man, and an affiliate of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit. It's the first time that a member of Evil Corp has been linked to another major gang and indicates that hackers are working across groups to carry out attacks. As well as the sanctions, four arrests were made, including two in the UK. In August, the NCA executed a number of search warrants in the south of England and arrested a 46-year-old male who is suspected of being linked to a LockBit affiliate. A 50-year-old female was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences. They too were interviewed and later released under investigation whilst the criminal investigation continues. Both individuals were identified through the analysis and enrichment of data acquired during the course of Operation Cronos - the international police operation that brought down LockBit's internal infrastructure. \u201cThe action announced today has taken place in conjunction with extensive and complex investigations by the NCA into two of the most harmful cybercrime groups of all time,\" said James Babbage, Director General for Threats at the NCA. The NCA said Evil Corp's links to the Russian links to the Russian state had been exposed. \"Today's sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem,\" said foreign secretary David Lammy.",

    "Maori haka in NZ parliament to protest at bill to reinterpret founding treaty\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNew Zealand's parliament was brought to a temporary halt by MPs performing a haka, amid anger over a controversial bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding treaty with M\u0101ori people. Opposition party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional ceremonial group dance after being asked whether her party supported the bill, which faced its first vote on Thursday. Meanwhile, a h\u012bkoi - or peaceful protest march - organised by a M\u0101ori rights group, is continuing to make its way towards the capital, Wellington. Thousands have already joined the nine-day march against the bill, which reached Auckland on Wednesday, having begun in the far north of New Zealand on Monday.\n\nThe country is often considered a leader in indigenous rights, but opponents of the bill fear those same rights are being put at risk by this bill. Act, the political party that introduced the bill, argues there is a need to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which has been fundamental to race relations in New Zealand. The core values of the treaty have, over time, been woven into New Zealand's laws in an effort to redress the wrong done to M\u0101ori during colonisation.\n\nThe protest march against the bill made its way through Auckland on Wednesday\n\nBut Act - a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition - say this has resulted in the country being divided by race, and the bill will allow the treaty to be interpreted more fairly through parliament, rather than the courts. The party's leader, David Seymour, has dismissed opponents as wanting to \"stir up\" fear and division. Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling of much-needed support for many M\u0101ori. The first reading passed on Thursday after a 30-minute break, backed by all parties from the ruling coalition. Maipi-Clarke was suspended from the house. It is unlikely to pass a second reading, as Act's coalition partners have indicated they will not support it. But this has not placated those worried about the bill, and its impact, with the hikoi still making progress along its 1,000km (621-mile) route.\n\nDanielle Moreau (centre) took part in the march as it passed through Auckland with her sons Bobby and Teddy\n\nIn Auckland, it took an estimated 5,000 marchers two hours to cross the harbour bridge. Officials had closed two lanes, the New Zealand Herald reported, external, to allow them to continue along the route. Danielle Moreau, who is M\u0101ori, walked over the Harbour Bridge with her two sons, Bobby and Teddy, and told the BBC she \"was hoping it [the h\u012bkoi] would be big but it was much more epic than I expected\". \"I marched to make the point that Te Tiriti [the Treaty of Waitangi] is very important to our national identity,\" said Winston Pond, who also took part in the march on Wednesday. \"We are a multi-cultural society built on a bicultural base - something that cannot be altered.\"\n\nJuliet Tainui-Hernandez (left), with her partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez (right) and daughter Paloma (centre)\n\nJuliet Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez, from the M\u0101ori tribe Ng\u0101i Tahu, and her Puerto Rican partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, brought their daughter Paloma to the h\u012bkoi. Ms Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez said those who turned out in support did so \"for the respectful and inclusive nation we want Aotearoa [New Zealand] to be for our tamariki mokopuna - our children and grandchildren\". Kiriana O\u2019Connell, who is also M\u0101ori, said that the current treaty principles were already a compromise for her people, and she would not support a \"rewrite\". Under the proposed legislation, the treaty principles that would be defined in law are:\n\u2022 None that the government has a right to govern and that parliament has the full right to make laws\n\u2022 None that the rights of M\u0101ori are respected by the Crown\n\u2022 None that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to equal protection under it. Act leader Seymour - who is also New Zealand's associate justice minister - argues that because the principles have never been properly defined legally, the courts \"have been able to develop principles that have been used to justify actions that are contrary to the principle of equal rights\". He says these include \"ethnic quotas in public institutions\" that go against the spirit of fairness for all New Zealanders. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, however, has called the bill \"divisive\" - despite being part of the same coalition.\n\nAct Party leader David Seymour will become deputy prime minister next year under a role-sharing agreement\n\nMeanwhile, the Waitangi Tribunal, which was set up in 1975 to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, notes the bill \"purposefully excluded any consultation with M\u0101ori, breaching the principle of partnership, the Crown\u2019s good-faith obligations, and the Crown\u2019s duty to actively protect M\u0101ori rights and interests\". It also said that the principles of the bill misinterpreted the Treaty of Waitangi and that this \"caused significant prejudice to M\u0101ori\". The tabling of the Treaty Principles Bill comes following a series of measures introduced by the government that have affected M\u0101ori. They include the closure of the M\u0101ori Health Authority, which was set up under Jacinda Ardern's Labour government to help create health equity, and reprioritising English over M\u0101ori when it comes to the official naming of government organisations, for example. While roughly 18% of New Zealand's population consider themselves to be M\u0101ori, according to the most recent census, many remain disadvantaged compared with the general population when assessed through markers such as health outcomes, household income, education levels and incarceration and mortality rates. There remains a seven-year gap in life expectancy. The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement between the British and many, but not all, M\u0101ori tribes, which was signed in 1840. It is contentious as it was written in both English and M\u0101ori - which had only been a spoken language until colonisation - and the two versions contain fundamental differences when it comes to issues such as sovereignty. While the treaty itself is not enshrined in law, its principles have been adopted over time into various pieces of legislation. The bill will now be sent to a select committee for a six-month public hearing process.",
    "The sprint finish to the start line is on. It is not the sprint finish to the finish line, but the sprint finish to the starting blocks. The next leader of the Conservative Party will be selected by Conservative Party members, but they will only get to choose from the final two candidates picked by Conservative MPs on Wednesday afternoon. Right now, there is: Intrigue, plotting, phone calls, quiet chats, guesswork and claims of underhand tactics. \u201cWe are pushing towards quite the season finale,\u201d one Conservative MP said to me. I know what you might be thinking: pull yourself together, this is a vote to determine the final two candidates to become the Leader of the Opposition next month. It is not exactly the race to the White House. But it is, nonetheless, a crunch moment.\n\nThere are three candidates left - James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch - but just two golden tickets. You can read more about the three still in the running here. The standout development in Tuesday\u2019s round of voting was James Cleverly propelling himself not just into the lead, but being miles in front. He managed 39 votes, a number even some in his own camp acknowledge was a bit higher than they were expecting. His performance is put down to making the most of his conference speech last week and the efficient hoovering up of quite a lot of MPs who had previously backed the former cabinet minister Mel Stride. In a race with 121 votes available in total, if every Conservative MP votes, 41 is sufficient to guarantee a place in the final two, since both rivals cannot outpoll you. (Incidentally, I am told that outgoing leader Rishi Sunak did not vote, meaning there was actually an electorate of 120).\n\nEither way, Cleverly is very nearly there, assuming he does not go backwards. The working assumption of all of the campaigns is that he is going to make the final pair. And so it is now a tussle between Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick for second place. Jenrick came second in this latest round of voting, with 31 votes \u2013 but managed to lose two votes from the previous round. Badenoch came third with 30, just one vote behind, but did gain two votes. And there are now 20 votes looking for a new home after the widely expected elimination of the former security minister Tom Tugendhat. It may not seem like a big number, but 20 is one heck of a lot in an electorate of 121. \u201cJames is an irrelevance now. It\u2019s all now a battle between us and Kemi\u2019s team,\u201d said a Team Jenrick insider. \u201cTom\u2019s supporters are closer to our side than hers,\u201d they added. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ahead in the end.\u201d It is a characteristic blast of confidence from Jenrick\u2019s camp, who have exuded plenty of it throughout. But there is no shortage of psychology in all of this too - and you might need a splash of outward confidence when you have just been knocked off top spot and managed to go backwards.\n\nSupporters of Badenoch acknowledge they would have liked to have seen her do better in the latest round. But they think there is a clump of Tugendhat supporters who really didn't like Jenrick\u2019s claim last week that British special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing terrorists\u201d because of the European Convention on Human Rights. They particularly disliked his use in a campaign video, external of footage of a comrade of Tugendhat\u2019s from his military days, who later died. \u201cRob is in trouble,\u201d one MP predicts \u2013 or hopes. So things are: Uncertain, mighty competitive and close. Tory MPs have to decide who they really do not want to be their leader and weigh up how party members might vote depending on the different potential pairings. The website ConservativeHome reckons, external that as things stand, James Cleverly could beat Robert Jenrick among the members, but Kemi Badenoch could beat James Cleverly. \u201cAccordingly, if MPs want to stop Cleverly from winning, backing Badenoch seems their best. \"And if they want to stop Badenoch, a vote for Jenrick beckons,\" as the ConservativeHome puts it. It is enough to make your head spin. Little wonder rumours are rife that all sorts of jiggery pokery has been going on - and could still be going on. Team Badenoch are playing hardball with an argument about her seeming popularity with party members. But they do so knowing some MPs really do not want her as leader. \u201cWhat will members say if they have to vote for two people they didn\u2019t want?\u201d says one. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like Liz and Rishi all over again, when the members wanted Penny vs Kemi,\u201d they add, in reference to Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt in the contest in 2022 and the prospect of a Cleverly-Jenrick run off. It leaves me pondering how the party would react if Badenoch is rejected by MPs. So, the stakes are high \u2013 as the Conservative Party approaches its biggest single moment yet since its calamitous election defeat in July.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Watch the moment Bianca Williams is taken out of a car and handcuffed by police\n\nTwo former Metropolitan Police officers have been handed their jobs back and will receive back-pay after winning an appeal against their dismissal following their stop and search of two athletes. Met PCs Jonathan Clapham and Sam Franks were fired in October 2023 after their search of the Olympic sprinters Bianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos. The two men won their appeal against a ruling which found they lied by saying they could smell cannabis during the stop and search in west London in July 2020. Mr Dos Santos described the appeal decision as \"disappointing\" and said he and Ms Williams would challenge it in the civil courts.\n\nDuring the incident, the couple were pulled over by the officers and searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons, but nothing was found. The officers had followed Ms Williams and her partner Mr Dos Santos as they drove home from training with their baby, who was then three months old. Mr Clapham and Mr Franks were dismissed after a disciplinary panel found they had lied about smelling cannabis when they pulled over the athletes. Their dismissal was overturned by the Police Appeals Tribunal, which found the panel's decision was \"irrational\" and \"inconsistent\".\n\nBianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos said they would challenge the appeal decision\n\nThe dismissed PCs were \"dedicated, hard-working and much respected officers\" whose reputations had been \"ruined\" by the original findings, Appeals Tribunal chairman Damien Moore said. \"Both officers did not lie. Both officers will now be reinstated to the Met Police. They should receive back-pay,\" he said. \"Being a police officer in London brings about its own set of unique challenges,\" Mr Moore added. He wished Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos \"all good fortune\". Hugh Davies, representing Mr Clapham, said the officers had \"every reason to suspect criminality\" when they pulled Dos Santos over. Mr Davies said another officer at the scene had smelled cannabis, but was not found to have lied.\n\nIn response to the appeal ruling, Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jon Savell said: \u201cWe know this has been an overly lengthy and horrendous process for PC Clapham and PC Franks, as well as their families and colleagues.\" He added that the case had been \"hard on all involved\" and re-emphasised a previous apology from the force to Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos over the stop and search. \"Ultimately, the evidence has shown that the stop and search and the actions of the officers did not amount to misconduct,\" Mr Savell said. \"However, stop and search is most effective when used with the trust and confidence of Londoners.\" He added the new \"stop-and-search charter\" would help rebuild trust.\n\nIn a statement following the tribunal decision, Mr Dos Santos maintained that the \"actions and allegations\" by the officers had been \"completely unacceptable\". \"Our drive home from training in 2020, with our baby, should never have turned into a violent incident where we were wrongly accused of smelling of drugs,\" he said. \"We are professional athletes; we pride ourselves on not doing drugs.\" He added: \"We shall challenge today's outcome in the civil courts. Jules Carey, of the law firm Bindmans, which represents the couple, said the complaints system had \"failed again\" and it \"will be for the civil courts to address this result\".\n\nRick Prior, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the officers had been \"fully exonerated and their reputations have rightly been restored\". \"Justice has been served. Why it ever got to this point, however, remains an absolute mystery,\" he said. Mr Prior said the reinstatements were \"yet another damning indictment\" of the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which referred the officers to the misconduct tribunal. \"Our colleagues have been dragged through hell and back for four years, for doing nothing more or less than the job the public of London expect us to do,\" he added. An IOPC spokesperson said: \"We note the outcome today of the officers' appeal and await the written decision by the Police Appeals Tribunal.\"\n\nMs Williams won silver at the Paris Olympics as part of the relay team\n\nMs Williams had alleged that racial profiling played a factor in the officers' conduct, but this was not upheld in the original misconduct tribunal. At the Paris Olympics this summer, she competed as part of the women's 4x100m quartet that qualified for the final and went on to win a silver medal.",
    "Surgeon operated with penknife he uses to cut up lunch\n\nPolice are looking into at least 105 cases of alleged medical negligence at the NHS trust\n\nA surgeon at a crisis-hit NHS trust used a Swiss Army penknife to open up the chest of a patient because he claimed he could not find a sterile scalpel. University Hospitals Sussex has said the operation was an emergency, but the surgeon\u2019s actions were \u201coutside normal procedures and should not have been necessary\u201d. Prof Graeme Poston, an expert witness on clinical negligence and a former consultant surgeon, told the BBC: \u201cIt surprises me and appals me. Firstly, a penknife is not sterile. Secondly it is not an operating instrument. And thirdly all the kit [must have been] there.\" Police are separately looking into at least 105 cases of alleged medical negligence at the trust and considering gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges.\n\nThe surgeon in the penknife case, who the BBC is not naming, was operating on a patient at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton when he struggled to find a scalpel. Instead he used a Swiss Army knife which he normally used to cut fruit for his lunch. The patient survived but internal documents show the surgeon\u2019s colleagues felt his behaviour was \u201cquestionable\u201d and were \u201cvery surprised\u201d he was unable to find a scalpel. The BBC has also discovered the same surgeon carried out three supposedly low-risk operations in two months where all three patients died soon after.\n\nThe BBC has previously reported that:\n\u2022 None Four whistleblowers said patients had died unnecessarily and been \u201ceffectively maimed\u201d at the trust\n\u2022 None A former surgeon claimed a \u201cgang culture\u201d existed in the neurosurgery department. The same doctor alleged one surgeon had disproportionate deaths and a second did complex operations without adequate training\n\u2022 None An internal review conceded doctors could have saved the life of student Melissa Zoglie had they acted sooner\n\u2022 None Sussex Police has recruited extra staff as part of its manslaughter probe concerning the trust\n\u2022 None A Royal College of Surgeons review found a \u201cculture of fear\u201d at the trust and suggested senior managers may need to be replaced\n\u2022 None The trust lost a nine-month legal battle with the BBC and The Times to block access to and redact documents in two employment tribunal cases\n\nThe trust launched a series of internal investigations into the three patients who died - and concluded that they had experienced \u201cpoor care\u201d. It also conceded one woman who died \u201cwould have survived if there were no post-operative complications\u201d. The woman\u2019s daughter, who asked not to be identified, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand how mum died. No one seemed to know why the operation was not successful. \u201cThere needs to be a thorough investigation into these deaths, not just an action plan. That\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nPolice say the trust is cooperating fully with the investigation\n\nHealth watchdog the Care Quality Commission looked at the deaths and concluded there had been no breach of regulations. University Hospitals Sussex said: \u201cOur investigations did not raise concerns about the surgeries themselves but did identify common themes for improvement, which we acted on immediately to ensure our services are as safe as possible. \u201cThese included better communication with patients before and after surgery, improved training for end-of-life care, and strengthened processes especially when care is transferred from one site to another.\u201d Prof Poston said these operations usually had a 1% chance of ending in death. After reviewing the surgeon\u2019s employment record, which included a long wait to become a consultant, Prof Poston said: \"I do not know this individual, but you would be concerned that there were problems during the course of that training and progression through training.\u201d\n\nShortly before the deaths, the operations had temporarily been moved to Worthing Hospital from a bigger site in nearby Brighton against some clinical advice. Trust chief executive George Findlay was told by colleagues they had safety concerns about moving the location of the operations. The trust\u2019s position did not change. University Hospitals Sussex said the decision to move the surgeries had included \u201ca thorough process\u2026 with oversight from the executive team\u201d. In response to the wider police investigation of the trust, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of concerning reports currently under investigation by Sussex Police and our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones. \u201cIt is vital police officers are given the space and support to properly investigate these matters. \"Sussex Police has confirmed University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust is cooperating fully with this investigation.\u201d\n\nDr Findlay said: \u201cI want to reassure all of our patients and staff that in each of the cases outlined in this report, thorough investigations took place, and action was taken whenever necessary to ensure lessons were learnt. \u201cWe were in touch with these families to express our sincere sympathies for their loss. \u201cIf we ever fall short of the standards people have a right to expect, then we are open, honest, and move swiftly to make improvements.\" He said the trust faced a number of long-standing challenges, and its teams were working hard to address them. \u201cI am proud of the progress they have made and they will be supported to make the further improvements we know are necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?",
    "Trudeau says the cuts to Canada's immigration targets will pause population growth over the next two years\n\nCanada has announced a sharp cut in the number of immigrants it allows into the country in an effort to \"pause population growth\", marking a notable shift in policy for the Justin Trudeau government. As part of the changes, Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents in 2025 from a previous target of 500,000 to 395,000 - a 21% drop. Prime Minister Trudeau said his government \"didn't get the balance quite right\" when it bolstered immigration post-pandemic to address labour shortages. Public support for immigration in Canada has been waning, with opinion polls suggesting rising concern over the growing numbers and its impact on housing and social services.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of already announced reduced targets for both international students and temporary foreign workers. On Thursday, Trudeau and Canada's immigration minister Marc Miller announced further cuts, this time to the number of new permanent residents. The goal, Miller said, is to set a smaller target of 365,000 new permanent residents by 2027. This reduction will pause population growth in Canada over the next two years, Trudeau said, giving provinces time to catch up on bolstering their healthcare programmes and housing stock. The prime minister said that \"Canadians are justifiably proud\" of their welcoming immigration system, which he said had helped bolster the country's economy and build diverse communities. \u201cOur immigration system has always been responsible and it has always been flexible,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe are acting today because of the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn\u2019t get the balance quite right.\u201d The vast majority of Canada\u2019s population growth last year - about 97% - was driven by immigration, according to federal data. At the same time, Canada\u2019s unemployment rate has increased to 6.5% and stands at over 14% for young people. The move marks a departure from decades of open immigration policies in Canada, which has relied on newcomers to meet population targets and to fill labour gaps. Since Trudeau was elected in 2015, his government has raised annual permanent resident targets from 272,000 to 485,000 this year. The biggest jump was seen in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic. Trudeau and his government have been criticised for increasing immigration without bolstering services or housing construction, and economists have warned that Canada's rapidly growing population has put a strain on housing and public services like healthcare. Earlier this month, a poll by the Environics Institute, which has tracked Canadians' attitudes towards immigration since 1977, revealed that 58% of Canadians now feel that immigration levels were too high. The institute said the findings suggest that public opinion on immigration levels has \"effectively flipped from being acceptable (if not valuable) to problematic\". The cuts to immigration targets have been criticised by advocacy groups like the Migrant Rights Network, who wrote in an open letter to Trudeau and Miller that migrants are being unfairly blamed for Canada's affordability crisis. \"Migrants are not responsible for Canada\u2019s housing crisis, lack of jobs, or inadequate healthcare or other public services,\" they said. The group added that these issues are rather a result of \"decades of federal and provincial policies that have underfunded and privatized public services\".",

In a statement, police said they discovered Payne's body after an emergency crew responded to an call in the upscale neighbourhood of Palermo on Wednesday. On Thursday, police in Buenos Aires said a preliminary autopsy suggests Liam Payne died from external and internal bleeding injuries. The police inspected the area where Payne fell, and found items including alcohol and a phone. Medication was found in his room. Payne had risen to global fame as part of the much-loved boyband created on the X Factor TV show in 2010, along with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik.\n\nAccording to police in Buenos Aires, officers at the scene were initially responding to reports \"of an aggressive man who may have been under the effects of drugs and alcohol\". When they arrived at the hotel, officials were told a loud sound had been heard in an interior courtyard. Soon after, they discovered the body there. A police investigation was then launched. Emergency medical services director Alberto Crescenti told local media that Payne had suffered \"serious injuries\" and that an autopsy will be carried out. Mr Crescenti declined to answer questions about the circumstances of Payne's fall from the balcony. The star's body has been transferred to a morgue in the city.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer (UK only)\n\nPolice in Buenos Aires confirmed on Thursday that an inspection of the scene where Payne fell has been carried out on the hotel\u2019s ground floor. They said that a bottle of whiskey, a lighter, and a mobile phone were found. Police said \"everything indicates that the musician was alone when the fall happened\", and that he had died at the scene and there were no injuries that suggested a third party had been involved. In the hotel room where Payne was staying, staff found \u201ctotal disorder\u201d including \u201cvarious items broken.\u201d They said this included several packets of medication, including Clonazepam, external, as well as over-the-counter medications. A notebook and passport were also found at the scene.\n\nEvidence and finger prints have been collected and the room\u2019s balcony has also been inspected to establish access to it. Five witness statements were taken by the police on the night, three from hotel employees and two from women who had been in the room with Payne earlier on, but were not there at the time of the fall. Payne posted on Snapchat just hours before the incident, saying: \"It's a lovely day here in Argentina\" but the video was from earlier in the week where he had spent time with his girlfriend Kate Cassidy.\n\u2022 None Boy band star who had the X factor\n\u2022 None The former One Direction star's life in pictures\n\nThe UK Foreign Office confirmed it was in touch with authorities in Argentina \"regarding reports of the death of a British man\". No further details were given. Once news of his death broke, fans began gathering outside the Buenos Aires hotel where the death took place, prompting police to cordon off the entrance. Some lit candles in his memory. \"I was in my living room and my sister told me Liam died,\" a young fan named Violeta Antier told Reuters news agency. \"We couldn't believe it. We came here directly to confirm it was true.\" Ms Antier said she saw Payne at the Niall Horan concert just two weeks ago. Another woman cried as she explained why she had come to the hotel, telling Reuters in Spanish: \"This is the only way I have to say goodbye to him\". One Direction had global success with hits such as What Makes You Beautiful and Story of My Life, while Payne also enjoyed some solo success after the band announced in 2015 that they were going on hiatus the following year.\n\nFans gathered outside the Buenos Aires hotel where Liam Payne was found dead\n\nIn August this year, Payne was announced as a judge on a new Netflix talent show alongside former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland and The Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger. Payne, who was born in Wolverhampton in the UK, first tried for stardom when he auditioned for ITV talent show The X Factor in 2008 \u2013 but judge Simon Cowell told him to \"come back in two years\". He did, impressing the judges more in 2010, and was put together with four other solo hopefuls at the boot camp stage and One Direction were born. The group had four UK number one albums and four number one singles as well as topping charts around the world, before Zayn Malik left in 2015, prompting the band's hiatus. In 2017, Payne's debut solo single Strip That Down, which peaked at number three on the Official UK Chart, and his collaboration with Rita Ora on the song For You - from the Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack \u2013 also reached the top 10. He began a relationship with Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy in 2016 and they had a son, Bear, the following year. The couple split in 2018. The BBC has seen a cease and desist letter against the singer earlier this week from another of Payne's former partners, Maya Henry. She had posted on social media accusing him of repeatedly contacting her. Payne did not respond to the accusations.",

Crash that killed four teens was avoidable, inquest hears\n\nA crash that killed four teenage boys when they drowned in an overturned car could have been avoided, an inquest has heard. Hugo Morris, 18, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Jevon Hirst, 16, all from Shrewsbury, died when their car left a rural road while they were on a camping trip last November. It flipped on to its roof in a flooded ditch, leaving the four A-level students trapped. A conclusion of road traffic collision was recorded by the senior coroner for North West Wales.\n\nThe teenagers had been visiting Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, when they set off from Harlech on 19 November to spend the night camping. But the Ford Fiesta being driven by Hugo left the A4085 road near the villages of Garreg and Llanfrothen. The crashed car could not be seen from the road and led to a massive two day search to find the boys. The inquest was told that a passing refuse recycling truck spotted the upturned car while on its round on the Tuesday morning.\n\nAll four students were found dead in the car. The inquest was told that post-mortem examinations revealed none of them had any internal or external injuries, and had died as a result of drowning. Giving evidence to the hearing, crash investigators for North Wales Police said there were \"no catastrophic mechanical failures\" with the car. However, both rear tyres were only half the required inflated pressure for carrying four people.\n\nMr Thompson said, in his view, Hugo had driven into a bend on the road too fast, causing the vehicle to come off the road. He said he calculated the maximum theoretical speed around the bend was 38mph. But he added: \"Having driven the bend myself the fastest speed I felt comfortable negotiating the bend was 26mph.\" He said the Ford Fiesta had entered that bend at a speed that was in excess of the limit to negotiate it, even though that may well have been below the road's 60mph limit. Mr Thompson said the actions of Hugo Morris needed to be considered in the accident. While it had been raining heavily, with leaf cover on the road, the investigator said he did not consider weather conditions played a role in the collision. But he said in his view, the crash \"was avoidable\".\n\nDelivering her conclusion, senior coroner Kate Robertson noted that there had been inadequate signage on the approach to the bend. She said she will also be writing to Cyngor Gwynedd and the landowner by the crash site about the need for fencing or barriers at the location. The coroner will also write to the UK government, raising her own concerns over newly qualified drivers being able to carry passengers. \"Having considered and heard the evidence I do have a concern,\" she said.\n\u2022 None A town in mourning for boys 'so full of promise'\n\nTributes were read out to all the boys by the coroner. Harvey's mother Crystal said he was \"perfect from the minute he came into the world and continued to be until he was tragically taken from us\". \"Harvey had the biggest, warmest smile that radiated love and calmness and a contagious positive energy,\" she said.\n\nHarvey Owen \"always had a soft spot for people who he knew were struggling to fit in or felt they were having a bad time,\" said his mother Crystal\n\nShe said \"every parent's worst nightmare came true\" last November and Harvey's family now faced \"a lifetime of grieving the life he should be living, the time we should have had with him and the memories we should be creating\".\n\nHeather Sanderson, Wilf's mother, said she was \"very proud\" of her son, who was \"so kind and had a lovely sense of humour\". \"I will miss him for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe car carrying the four teens came off the A4085\n\nIn a statement the mother of Jevon said he was \"happiest when he was at home with his family\". \"He was really close to his family and was loved,\" said Melanie Hirst.\n\nThe parents of Hugo said their son had a \"thirst for life\". \"No words can express our loss,\" said Dominic and Sarah Morris. \"Our world is shattered, bent and cracked. He is impossible to forget.\"\n\nHarvey's mother, Ms Owen, said the death of her son and his friends has led to her launching a campaign to change the law for younger drivers. She has started an online petition calling for the introduction of a graduated driving licence. It would require new learners to have at least six months training before being able to apply for a test. It would also ban newly-qualified drivers from carrying passengers under the age of 25 for the first six months, without an older adult present. Speaking outside the coroner's court, Ms Owen said she was \"very happy\" with the outcome but the government still needed to act. She said: \"My son was able to get in the back of a car driven by a young, inexperienced driver and be driven on an unfamiliar rural road without my knowledge. He was let down by an outdated driving licence system.\"",

    "Striking Boeing workers are set to vote on a new offer from the aviation giant, which includes a 38% pay rise over the next four years. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union, which represents more than 30,000 striking workers, has endorsed the offer and says it will hold a ballot of its members on Monday. The walkout started on 13 September, leading to a dramatic slowdown in production and deepening a crisis at the firm. The union had previously called for a 40% pay increase and workers have rejected two previous offers, including the last offer of a 35% rise.\n\nAs well as the proposed pay rise, the latest offer includes a $12,000 (\u00a39,300) bonus for the workers if a deal is reached, up from $7,000. \"It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,\" an IAM social media post said. \"We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success.\" Boeing said the offer would see average annual pay rise to $119,309 over the next four years. \"We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4,\" Boeing said in a statement. The new offer also includes changes to workers' retirement plans.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2.7% in extended trading in New York after the proposed deal was announced.

Last week, its commercial aircraft business reported operating losses of $4bn for the three months to the end of September. The company also launched a share sale to raise more than $20bn earlier this week. It came after warnings that a prolonged strike could lead to downgrades to Boeing's credit rating, which would make it more expensive for it to borrow money. The firm is also moving ahead with plans to lay off around 17,000 workers, with the first redundancy notices expected to be issued in mid-November. The latest crisis at Boeing erupted in January with a dramatic mid-air blowout of a piece of one of its passenger planes. Its space business also suffered a reputational hit after its Starliner vessel was forced to return to Earth without carrying astronauts.",
    "It has been a matter of 'when' not 'if' Joe Root would beat Sir Alastair Cook's England Test run-scoring record. This air of inevitability has been looming for the past 10 years and finally, with a century in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan, he cruised past with plenty left in the tank. I first bowled properly at Joe Root at the old stadium in Ahmedabad in 2012, before the massive Narendra Modi Stadium was built. He was a 21-year-old on his first England tour and I had been in the England side for more than two years. This was the famous series when we beat India 2-1 - the last time they lost at home. I had torn my quad on the first day of a warm-up game in Mumbai and was making my way back to fitness, building up my workload in the nets. The recovery was going well. I was just about up to full pace and decided to pick a ball that would reverse swing as a confidence booster, to take a few wickets and get the bounce in my run-up going. I always felt as though I attacked the crease and committed to the motion of bowling much better when the ball was reversing. I would predominantly swing the ball away from right-handers when the ball was reverse-swinging, to drag them and their head across their crease and to threaten the outside edge, then bowl an effort-ball inswinger when the batter was least expecting it. At the time I was capable of bowling upwards of 90mph and could rush some of the best players in the world. I was dragging Root across the crease, moving his head outside off stump and then tried my first inswinger. He played it with perfect balance, eyes level, under his nose to mid-on as though he had telepathically read what I was trying to do. For such a young player, he just felt different.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWe continued this battle for the rest of the net. I would try to hide the ball, switching it in my hand as I was loading up. I may have even tried marginally over-stepping to try to beat him for pace. It didn't matter. He played me serenely for the rest of the net. This isn't to say playing me bowling well is a litmus test for being a good batter, far from it. But, from a bowler's point of view, you get a real sense of how good a batter is when you're bowling at them in the nets. It is a tight, enclosed space. More balls are bowled in a shorter space of time than during a game. It can be intense. A bowler gets an inclination of when a batter is a good player and Root certainly stood out from any other young batter I had bowled to at the time. Root arrived into a successful team. We won the Ashes in Australia and had been ranked number one in the world. There were some big names in there: Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Matt Prior. He was not overawed. Instead, he was immediately cheeky. The Joe Root grin we have seen so often throughout the past 12 years was there every day of his first tour. He played pranks and got stuck into the environment as though he was someone who was going to be in that dressing room for a long time. The only time that smile evaded him was towards the end of his captaincy tenure. Thankfully it returned straight after.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA sign of how good a person Root is, is how he settled back into the ranks once his great mate Ben Stokes took over the captaincy. Even though it was clear he wanted to carry on as skipper after the West Indies series of 2022, Root doubled down on the style of play Stokes wanted. The message that sent to the dressing room would have been huge and one of the reasons the changeover of captaincy was so seamless. Root has always had an ability to adapt and evolve. He is never satisfied and never stands still. For everything which comes naturally to him, like the straight-bat punch off the back foot through backward point, there are other things he has had to work at in order to survive and excel, especially in foreign conditions: rotating the strike from spin off both front and back foot, becoming so selective about how and when he plays his sweeps (not to be confused with reverse scoops). It is not a stretch to say he is renowned as the best batter in the world in sub-continental conditions for visiting teams from outside Asia. Root has an insatiable hunger for runs. When he gets an opportunity to go big, he will rarely throw it away. He had troubles early in his career converting fifties to hundreds. Those experiences have made him realise the opportunity to score centuries doesn't just grow on trees. You can see the concentration and determination in his eyes when he is not willing to leave any runs out there. In his first 97 Tests he scored 17 hundreds and 49 fifties. In the 49 Tests up to this series he scored 17 hundreds and 15 fifties. A quite remarkable conversion rate. The next statistical aim for Root is Sachin Tendulkar's all-time Test run-scoring record of 15,921. Root is only 33 and at his current rate of scoring it would take him 38 Tests to overhaul 'The Little Master'. It is not inconceivable this feat could be completed within three years. Root has been bullish about not being close to satisfied at merely surpassing Cook, and that he has many more Test runs in his sights. It is a comforting thought for England fans. Psychologically, he may consider a stack of runs in a successful away Ashes series win as the prize to top off a magnificent career. In Australia, Root averages 35.68 with no hundreds. He has played in some horror shows of series down under and might be grateful to catch Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins well into their 30s next winter. England's greatest ever batter has two more peaks to conquer. He isn't done yet.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "P&O owner to attend summit despite row over minister's comments\n\nP&O Ferries owner, DP World, will now attend the UK's investment summit on Monday, despite a row over a minister's criticism of the firm. It had been feared they might pull out from the summit - where they were expected to announce a \u00a31bn investment - after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh criticised the ferry firm and urged consumers to boycott the company. An expansion of the firm's London Gateway port, in Essex, is likely to go ahead, with an announcement expected by some in the coming days. Whitehall sources said on Saturday that there had been \"warm engagement\" between senior figures in the firm and the government since Sir Keir Starmer distanced himself from his minister's remarks.\n\nThe government is hosting the International Investment Summit, where it hopes to attract billions of pounds of investment. A Downing Street spokesperson said the summit would \"show Britain is open for business\" as it looks to enable economic growth. Later, a government source said the prime minister had confidence in Haigh. A government spokesperson said: \"DP World\u2019s investment in Britain is a vote of confidence in the stability and seriousness of the government. We welcome the jobs and opportunities it will create.\" They added that the government was unlocking the UK's \"potential and ambition\" by working in partnership with businesses and investors around the world. DP World has said the expansion of the London Gateway port would bring Thurrock hundreds of jobs. The United Arab Emirates-based company also owns the container port in Southampton. It has yet to comment publicly on the latest developments. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast on Friday, Sir Keir said Haigh's comments were \"not the view of the government\". The prime minister is understood not to have been directly involved in talks with DP World, nor has he personally spoken to Haigh about her remarks.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. P&O criticism 'not view of the government', says Starmer\n\nThe row started after Haigh described P&O as a \"rogue operator\" in an interview with ITV on Wednesday, after it sacked nearly 800 seafarers in 2022 and replaced them with cheaper workers. Asked whether she used the ferry service, she said: \"I've been boycotting P&O Ferries for two-and-a-half years and I would encourage consumers to do the same.\" DP World insisted the move was needed for the survival of the ferry operator and to secure thousands of jobs. Haigh's comments in the interview coincided with the Department for Transport announcing new legislation aimed at protecting seafarers' jobs from so-called \"fire and rehire\" practices of \"rogue employers\". In that announcement, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner was quoted calling P&O Ferries' prior actions \"outrageous\". But senior government figures have since told the BBC that they were incensed by the specific suggestion that consumers boycott the ferry firm. Haigh's comments also attracted criticism from the Conservatives, with shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake arguing Labour \"don't understand business\". However, the Labour chair of the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, defended Haigh. She had been \"absolutely right to say that the behaviour of P&O, owned by DP World, in the past has been completely unacceptable\", he said. The row has exposed a tension between the new government's desire to attract business and strengthen workers' rights.",
    "Standing on a podium in a Florida convention centre on the night of the election, a row of American flags behind him and a jubilant crowd looking on, Donald Trump declared: \u201cMany people have told me that God spared my life for a reason, and that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\u201d\n\nThis was one of the most striking themes of his election campaign - that he had been chosen by God.

Additionally, a number of rail services were cancelled from the new Grand Central Station due to \"operational reasons\". In a post on X, formerly Twitter, the transport operator said some bus services in and out of the city centre are experiencing delays of approximately 35 minutes. \"Apologies for any delay and inconvenience,\" it said. The transport provider also issued warnings to commuters on Thursday evening as a result of heavy traffic in and out of Belfast city centre.\n\nDigital signage informed commuters that some services have been delayed or cancelled due to roadworks\n\nOn the rail network, the 18:04 BST Portadown to Belfast Grand Central service was cancelled. Translink said the 18:43 Belfast Grand Central to Lisburn service was also cancelled. A number of other trains, including the Enterprise service between Belfast and Dublin, and the Bangor to Belfast line, faced delays. \"Due to operational reasons, we have disruption to train services this evening,\" Translink posted on X, adding a further apology for the inconvenience.

It said that on Thursday afternoon, there were a number of collisions across the city, including an eight-vehicle crash on the M1 southbound between Broadway and Stockmans Lane. This brought traffic to a standstill. The DfI said the crash resulted in long delays back long the M1 and Westlink and onto the M3 and M2. \"The recovery operation took quite some time and again traffic was brought to a standstill at peak rush hour,\" the DfI said. During this recovery operation, another collision happened on the M3's Lagan Bridge east-bound. This caused delays for traffic approaching from the Westlink and M2. \"Both incidents occurred during the peak rush hour period and the time required to ensure that emergency services could attend, and the vehicles could be recovered also had a knock-on effect on some public transport services,\" the DfI said. The Department said it understands that traffic delays are \"frustrating\" and urged commuters to consider using public transport.\n\nOn Friday, Hospitality Ulster and Retail NI called for a return of a pre-Christmas moratorium on city centre roadworks. In a joint statement, the two organisations said the call \"comes admist further traffic congestion in the city... causing major disruption\". The organisations' chief executives have written to the DfI to seek a meeting with Minister for Infrastructure John O'Dowd to discuss the possible move. Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster and Glyn Roberts from Retail NI said: \"For weeks now we have seen bad traffic congestion in the city centre associated with the roadworks, but as seen yesterday, one accident can turn bad congestion into a complete standstill.\" \"If traffic and public transport congestion continues as is and worsens the closer, we get to Christmas, people simply won't come to the city centre.\"\n\nInfrastructure Minister John O\u2019Dowd earlier this week urged people to use public transport\n\nEarlier this week, John O\u2019Dowd, who oversees bus and rail services in Northern Ireland, urged commuters to consider public transport, instead of driving. A year-long closure of Durham Street, a busy road in central Belfast, has led to fears of more congestion in the city. O'Dowd had hoped the start of rail services on Sunday from the new Grand Central Station in the city would encourage more people to use public transport. However, the redevelopment of the area surrounding the new station is blamed by many drivers for causing the traffic problems in the first place.",
    "BBC presenter Paddy McGuinness will start his ultra-endurance challenge later\n\nTV presenter Paddy McGuinness has said Sir Chris Hoy pushed him to his \"absolute limits\" when they trained together ahead of his ultra-endurance cycling challenge for BBC Children in Need. McGuinness, 51, is set to ride nearly 300 miles (483km) when he sets off from Wrexham in Wales later, before aiming to arrive at the finish line on Friday in Glasgow, Scotland. \"Chris Hoy has been absolutely, as you can imagine with someone like him, outstanding, first class, brilliant with his advice,\" McGuinness said. \"When I go on a bike ride with Chris, I really know about it, because he pushes me to my absolute limits,\" he added.\n\nPaddy McGuinness said Sir Chris Hoy had been \"brilliant with his advice\"\n\nMcGuinness, who hosts a Sunday morning show on BBC Radio 2, will cycle through three nations and eight counties on a modified Raleigh Chopper bike.

    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nThe father of 10-year-old Sara Sharif called police from Pakistan and admitted he killed her at their Surrey home, a court heard. Urfan Sharif made the confession in an eight minute-call about an hour after his family\u2019s flight had landed in Islamabad on 10 August last year, before Sara's body was found. Mr Sharif, 42, Sara's stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and her uncle Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murdering the girl at the Old Bailey. Jurors were told Mr Sharif's case was that Ms Batool was responsible for Sara's death and his confession on the phone call and also in a note was false to protect her.\n\nProsecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC told the court Sara had been the victim of violent assaults for \u201cweeks and weeks, at least\u201d, before he listed a series of injuries she had suffered. He said Sara had external and internal injuries, including extensive bruising, burns and broken bones, old and new. She had burns to her buttocks, caused by a domestic iron, and six \u201cprobable human bite marks\u201d to her arms and legs, the prosecution said. Dental impressions ruled out that the bite marks had been caused by the male defendants, but Ms Batool had refused to provide the impressions, the court heard. Sara also suffered injuries to her ribs, shoulder blades, fingers and 11 separate fractures to her spine, as well as signs of a traumatic brain injury, the prosecution added.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nMr Sharif called Surrey Police from Pakistan where the family had fled before her body was found and told the operator that he killed his daughter. The prosecutor said that in the call, which lasted eight minutes and 34 seconds, Mr Sharif told the operator that he \u201clegally punished her\u201d and she died. Later in the call to police, Sara\u2019s father was said to have told the operator that Sara had been naughty and that he then beat her up, jurors heard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much\u201d, the prosecutor said Mr Sharif went on to tell the operator.\n\nHowever, Mr Emlyn Jones KC added: \u201cSara had not just been beaten up. Her treatment, certainly in the last few weeks of her life, had been appalling and brutal.\u201d The court also heard that next to Sara\u2019s body was a note in Urfan Sharif\u2019s handwriting. Mr Emlyn Jones KC said it read: \u201cWhoever see this note it\u2019s me Urfan Sharif who killed my daughter by beating. I am running away because I am scared but I promise I will hand over myself and take punishment. \u201cI swear to God that my intention was not to kill her but I lost it.\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC added: \u201cAs in the 999 call, on the face of it, the note appears to be a confession to having caused Sara\u2019s death by beating her up.\u201d\n\nJurors also heard that police found Sara\u2019s body on a bottom bunkbed under covers as if she was asleep. \u201cBut she was not asleep, she was dead,\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC told the jury. The three defendants, who lived with Sara before her death in August last year, are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they deny. Mr Emlyn Jones KC added that each defendant was seeking to \u201cdeflect the blame\u201d onto one or both of the others. The prosecution said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that any of the adults could have carried out the abuse \u201cwithout the complicity, participation, assistance and encouragement of the others\u201d. \u201cNone of them ever reported Sara\u2019s abuse to any outside agency, who could have intervened,\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC added.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "Joe Freeman with James and Arthur Dunley, who all took part in the contest\n\nThey came in their flat caps, waistcoats and with an ice-cool stare - all hoping to be crowned the best lookalike of Peaky Blinders' Tommy Shelby. The contest took place on Saturday in Birmingham city centre and follows the craze of celebrity doppelganger competitions currently sweeping the globe. Over 100 spectators gathered outside the Bullring to watch participants step forward with their best impression of Cillian Murphy's character. Based on levels of applause and a judges' opinions, 66-year-old Derek Brennan was named the winner.\n\nDerek Brennan said he thought he'd be too old to be crowned the winner\n\n\"My looks and my personality won me the competition, I can't help but be the best,\" Mr Brennan joked. Speaking to the BBC, he said he thought of himself as too old to be called a lookalike but friends had always said he resembled the hero of Steven Knight's hit series. \"People would tell me I look like him [Cillian Murphy] but I always thought I'd be too old so I joke and say I could be his dad.\"\n\nStudent Joe Freeman braved the rain and donned a suit after hearing about the contest on Instagram. He was so committed he got his hair cut the day before. \"I really love the Peaky Blinders and my auntie who is American always says I look like Thomas Shelby - I was going all out and here to win.\"\n\nA prize of a \u00a3500 shopping spree was up for grabs\n\nJames Dunley, 22, and his dad Arthur travelled from Telford, Shropshire, to take part. James said being amongst fans made the event exciting. \"I'm Irish so I share that connection with Cillian and I'm told that I have similar features as him as well,\" he said. \"I'm more here for the fans, the excitement and just meeting everybody. \"I became a huge fan of the show after people kept telling me I looked like Tommy.\" The series, which ran from 2013 to 2022, followed the escapades of a Birmingham crime gang in the years after World War One.

    "No one can doubt Israel\u2019s determination to defend its people, helped enormously by the might of the United States. It is clear though, that the war has shown that nobody can fool themselves that Palestinians will accept lives lived forever under an Israeli military occupation, without proper civil rights, freedom of movement and independence.\n\nAfter generations of conflict Israelis and Palestinians are used to confronting each other. But they are also used to living alongside each other, however uncomfortably. When a ceasefire comes, and with a new generation of leaders, there will be chances to push again for peace.\n\nBut that is a more distant future. The rest of the year and into 2025, with a new president in the White House, are uncertain and full of danger.\n\nFor months after Hamas attacked Israel, the fear was that the war would spread, and get worse. Slowly, and then very quickly, it happened, after Israel\u2019s devastating attacks on Hezbollah and Lebanon.\n\nIt is too late to say the Middle East is on the brink. Israel is facing off against Iran. The warring parties have plunged over it, and countries not yet directly involved are desperate not to be dragged over the edge.\n\nAs I write Israel has still not retaliated for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. It has indicated that it intends to inflict a severe punishment. President Biden and his administration, Israel\u2019s constant supplier of weapons and diplomatic support, are trying to calibrate a response that might offer Iran a way to stop the accelerating climb up the ladder of escalation, a phrase strategists use to describe the way wars speed from crisis to disaster.\n\nThe proximity of the US elections, along with Joe Biden\u2019s steadfast support for Israel, despite his misgivings about the way it has been fighting, do not induce much optimism that the US will somehow finesse a way out.\n\nThe signals from Israel indicate that Netanyahu, Gallant, the generals of the IDF and the intelligence agencies believe they have the upper hand. October 7th was a disaster for them. All the major security and military chiefs, except the prime minister, apologised and some resigned. They had not planned for a war with Hamas. But planning for the war with Hezbollah started after the last one ended in 2006 in a humiliating stalemate for Israel. Hezbollah has suffered blows from which it might never recover.\n\nSo far Israel\u2019s victories are tactical. To get to a strategic victory it would need to coerce its enemies into changing their behaviour. Hezbollah, even in its reduced state, is showing that it wants to fight on. Taking on Israeli infantry and tanks now that south Lebanon has once more been invaded might negate some of Israel\u2019s advantages in air power and intelligence.\n\nIf Iran answers Israel\u2019s retaliation with another wave of ballistic missiles other countries might get pulled in. In Iraq, Iran\u2019s client militias could attack American interests. Two Israeli soldiers were killed by a drone that came from Iraq.\n\nSaudi Arabia is also looking on nervously. Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman has made clear his view of the future. He would contemplate recognising Israel, but only if the Palestinians get a state in return and Saudi Arabia gets a security pact with the United States.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s role, simultaneously trying to restrain Israel while supporting it with weapons, diplomacy and carrier strike groups, exposes the Americans to getting involved in a wider war with Iran. They don\u2019t want that to happen, but Biden has pledged that he will come to Israel\u2019s aid if it becomes necessary.\n\nIsrael\u2019s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, and the damage done to Iran\u2019s strategy and its \u201caxis of resistance\u201d is fostering a new set of illusions among some in Israel and the United States. The dangerous idea is that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the Middle East by force, imposing order and neutering Israel\u2019s enemies. Joe Biden \u2013 and his successor \u2013 should be wary of that.\n\nThe last time that restructuring the Middle East by force was contemplated seriously was after al-Qaeda\u2019s 9/11 attacks on America, when US President George W Bush and Tony Blair, the UK\u2019s prime minister, were getting ready to invade Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq did not purge the Middle East of violent extremism. It made matters worse.\n\nThe priority for those who want to stop this war should be a ceasefire in Gaza. It is the only chance to cool matters and to create a space for diplomacy. This year of war started in Gaza. Perhaps it can end there too.",
    "MP Chris Webb said he was not injured in the attack in the capital\n\nLabour MP Chris Webb has described being mugged in London by a gang who stole his mobile phone. Writing on X, external, the member for Blackpool South said he was attacked as he returned from parliament along Lambeth Walk to his flat in the capital at about 22:00 GMT on Monday night. The Labour MP said that while he is \"not an easy target\" as a \"big guy\" of 6ft 2in, a \"stealthy\" group on bikes clad in balaclavas managed to catch him off-guard. \"Luckily I have no injuries and I am ok,\" he said.\n\nDowning Street said Sir Keir Starmer's thoughts were with Mr Webb. A spokesman for the prime minister said there had been a shocking rise in people snatching bags and phones, and more must be done. Mr Webb told how he was mugged: \"I was walking to the shop. I was on the phone to my wife. \"I then literally said I think I jinxed myself, that I better get off my phone. I don't know this area and it's a bit dark. \"Got to the shop, said that and, as I'm walking away, went to reach into my pocket to get my phone to phone my wife back, and that's when they grab me. \"They grab my arm to stop me and then off they went,\" he said.\n\nThe MP was targeted in the robbery in central London on Monday\n\nThe gang made a quick getaway on their bikes, he added. Webb said he then locked his iPhone using his smartwatch and when police came, he helped them to track the phone to a location where a suspect was caught with a bag of phones and arrested. However, the MP's phone was not recovered. He added: \"I wasn't on the phone at the time and I didn't hear them, which is remarkable in itself, of how stealthy they are, because these are on bikes,\" he added. \"So the fact that, you know, and I'm normally pretty aware of my surroundings, I've got pretty decent reflexes and things like that from training and boxing training. \"And I'm just surprised, because if I grabbed hold of one of them, they would have gone flying on the bike, because I wouldn't have let go. So I'm kind of surprised how they managed to get so close to me without me realising.\"\n\nHe said his first instinct was to chase the group but he quickly realised he should instead get the phone tracked and locked and call the police. \"I don't think I was targeted as an MP,\" he continued. \"While I was in a suit and shirt and tie, they would not have known I was a member of parliament.\" He said the police went \"above and beyond\" to help him. The Metropolitan Police said officers were called at 21:55 GMT on Monday. \"The victim was approached by a group of men who stole his phone from his hand. Inquiries remain ongoing,\" the force said.\n\u2022 None MP sworn in at Commons after by-election win",
    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTasha Ghouri was in tears on Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday night as she opened up about the negative reaction she has experienced online due to her disability. The former Love Island star, 26, and dancer partner Aljaz Skorjanec impressed the judges and got a joint series high score of 39 as they performed to What About Us by Pink. But before the dance, Ghouri, who was born deaf and uses a cochlear implant, became visibly emotional as she told viewers about online trolls who made videos about the way she speaks. She revealed that after her stint on dating show Love Island in 2022, she received an onslaught of cruel comments, leaving her feeling like she had let down \"the whole deaf community\".\n\nThe model, author and podcaster, from North Yorkshire, became Love Island's first deaf contestant when she appeared on the ITV show, eventually finishing joint fourth with boyfriend Andrew Le Page, who she is still in a relationship with. Ghouri said she joined the show to find love, as well as to raise awareness for the deaf community, but instead found herself the victim of online hate. \"When I left the show, I remember my dad sat me down and he looked at me straight and said 'Tash, there is a lot of horrific stuff that was written about you, especially on social media,'\" she said. \"There are videos made about my voice and the way I speak, it became a trend at one point.\"\n\nGhouri said the experience made her hit \"rock bottom\". \"Because I wanted to go on for representation and I feel like I failed, not just myself but, the whole deaf community,\" she said. But she insisted she would not let the trolls win. \"I'm going to use my platform and educate people,\" she said.\n\nToday, Ghouri has more than 2.2 million followers across her social media platforms. She has worked with Number 10 Downing Street and the Department for Education to champion issues on behalf of people who are deaf. Speaking ahead of the start of this year's Strictly series, Ghouri admitted how much the moment meant to her. \u201cI can't believe I'm going to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I\u2019ve been watching the show since I was little and it's a firm Ghouri family favourite, so this is a total dream come true,\" she said. Her appearance comes three years after Rose Ayling-Ellis became Strictly's first deaf contestant, and went on to win.\n\nJB Gill performed with Lauren Oakley, as Amy Dowden watched from the studio\n\nThe remaining 10 celebrities and their professional dance partners took to the ballroom floor on Saturday evening as part of Strictly Come Dancing's inaugural icons week. Taylor Swift and Beyonce were among the stars who were honoured during the show. JLS singer JB Gill and stand-in professional partner Lauren Oakley joined Ghouri and Skorjanec at the top of the leaderboard, scoring the joint highest number of points of this year's series. Professional dancer Amy Dowden, who is partnered with Gill, was forced to miss last Sunday's results programme after being taken to hospital as a \"precaution\" after she began \"feeling unwell\". Oakley stood in for her, performing a Bruno Mars medley with Gill on Saturday's show, which gave the pair a score of 39. The celebration of icons continues on Sunday night, when the professional dancers will perform a Beyonce medley with Johannes Radebe channelling the singer's alter-ego, Sasha Fierce.",
    "New Paddington film charming but slow, critics say\n\nThe nation's favourite bear is back for another adventure\n\nThe much-anticipated new Paddington in Peru film has had mixed reviews over its opening weekend, with critics calling it \"charming-enough\", but some agreeing the film struggles to reach the heights of its predecessors. The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy. The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November. Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.\n\nOf the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian, external that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\". In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote, external that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\". Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, external, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\". He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".\n\nBen Whishaw returns to voice the bear for the third time\n\nThe Telegraph's Tim Robey, external was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant. Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire, external: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears. \"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\" Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, external, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love. \"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"\n\nColman brings a musical charm to the film as the Reverend Mother\n\nThe director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton. Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, external, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\". Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, external, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\". She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\" Away from the big screen, a new Paddington musical is being developed for the stage, with McFly's Tom Fletcher set to write the music and lyrics. On November 7 the cast of the upcoming film unveiled special livery on a Great Western Railway (GWR) train that will travel through Devon and Cornwall.",
    "The city's roads have been blocked with shipping containers to stop the march reaching the centre\n\nSupporters of jailed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan have been pushed back by security forces after reaching the heart of the heavily-barricaded capital earlier on Tuesday. The convoy of opposition protesters has been marching towards Islamabad's D Chowk - or Democracy Square - since the weekend, demanding Khan's release, among other things. At least six people were killed - four paramilitary soldiers, and two protesters - as the march moved through the city, clashing with security forces at points. A number of protesters did make it as far as D Chowk however, and were seen scrambling over shipping containers placed to block their way.\n\nBut hours after protesters reached the square, security forces successfully cleared the area. As darkness fell, the lights were switched off - only police officers and paramilitary soldiers left behind. A police officer nearby said that some protesters had made it beyond the three-tier stack of shipping containers, but only a few hundred metres before they were pushed back. However, thousands of Khan supporters remain in the area - to keep warm in the biting cold, protesters have started burning paper and other materials inside rubbish bins. Many have even resorted to burning grass and bushes on the footpaths and greenbelts, where people are gathered. Muhammad Shahid, who came with his family all the way from Punjab province, says they\u2019re here because of Imran Khan\u2019s message: \u201cHe says we must fight for our rights.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand up for our fundamental rights. Imran Khan has been illegally arrested, and we will fight to make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nKhan, who has been in prison for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated, has urged his supporters not to give up - encouraging people to continue towards D Chowk. \"My message to my team is to fight till the end, we will not back down,\" the former prime minister said on X. Even from behind bars, the former cricket star has proved a powerful player in Pakistan politics. During elections in February, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been banned from standing and was forced to run candidates as independents, emerged as the single largest bloc. However, they fell short of the majority and their rivals united to form a new government. As a result, protesters are also calling for the overturning of election results they say were rigged - a claim disputed by the government. It was Khan who called on his supporters to take to the streets at the weekend, issuing a \"final call\" and asking them to stay in the capital until their demands are met.\n\nThe government - which had already introduced a ban on public gatherings -responded by blocking Islamabad's streets with shipping containers, and bussing in police from across the country. Restrictions also appear to have been brought in on some internet services, while schools and colleges have been shut because of fears of violence. Pakistan's interior minister said the protesters had been offered an alternative venue for their protest but had refused. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who blamed the protesters for the deaths of four soldiers on Tuesday, dismissed the march as \"extremism\". \"These disruptive elements do not seek revolution but bloodshed,\" he said in a statement. Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party, told news agency Reuters at least two protesters had been killed - one shot, and one run over by a vehicle. At least 50 people have been injured.\n\nAdditional reporting by Farhat Javed, Malik Mudassir and Fakhir Munir in Islamabad",
    "Bianca Gascoigne has alleged that she was groomed and sexually assaulted by former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed when she worked at the department store as a teenager. The TV personality, who is the adopted daughter of ex-England footballer Paul Gascoigne, was 16-years-old at the time, and said Al Fayed would grope her and force her to kiss him. She told Sky News, external that she did not speak out sooner because she did not want to bring \"embarrassment and shame\". Gascoigne's comments come after Harrods confirmed to the BBC on Monday that more than 250 people were now in its process to settle compensation claims brought by women who allege historical sexual misconduct again Al Fayed.\n\nWarning: this story contains details some may find distressing The 37-year-old reality TV star and DJ told the broadcaster she used to visit the luxury department store with her parents when she was growing up, and described Fayed as \"charming\" and \"personable\", saying he used to bring the family gifts. \"He used to tell me how much of a bad father my dad was, because he used to come into the store drunk,\" she said. \"He used to tell me that he was an embarrassment, that I should look to him as a father figure.\" She added she felt a \"false sense of security with him early doors\". Gascoigne joined Harrods as a shop floor worker but was later promoted to her \"dream \" job of becoming a fashion buyer. But she said Al Fayed would grope her and force her to kiss him during their weekly meetings.\n\nOn one occasion, Gascoigne was offered the opportunity to stay in the Harrods Park Lane apartment before an early morning work flight. But when Al Fayed turned up at the apartment, she said she was \"gobsmacked\", \"shell-shocked\" and did not know what to do. \"He came in, and then he sat me down on the sofa and was obviously very forceful with the touching and the kissing,\" she said. \"He got his privates out and got my hand and was trying to manoeuvre it on his parts, and when that didn't work, he was trying to force my head on his lap.\" She said she managed to \"wiggle away\" and the encounter was \"horrific\". She thinks Al Fayed knowing who her parents were was what saved her in the moment. \"He was doing all these things to me and I was close to people that he knew, and I felt like I couldn't even tell them either because I didn't want to bring embarrassment and shame,\" she said, adding that not even her mum and dad knew what was going on. Gascoigne said she was also scared of losing her job, and that Al Fayed had warned her that she would if she said anything.\n\nGascoigne, who gave birth to a daughter last year, said she was compelled to talk about her experience after several victims went public with their stories of abuse at the hands of Al Fayed. \"I feel like I have to do this, I want to do this, and I want to stand for the women and just hopefully make any kind of change (so) that in the future, my daughter wouldn't have to go through something like this,\" she said. Lawyers from the Justice for Harrods Survivors group, who represent the accusers of the former Harrods boss, have praised Gascoigne for her bravery, adding they are \"proud to represent her and our other survivors as we move forward together in our quest for justice\". The BBC has approached Gascoigne for further comment. Al Fayed, who died last year aged 94, is accused of sexual misconduct by several women who worked for him - many of whom felt unable to report what had happened until recently. At the time of many of the alleged attacks, the billionaire businessman was the owner of Harrods, the Ritz Paris hotel and football club Fulham FC. The BBC heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-employees at Harrods during its investigation for the documentary and podcast - Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods. The documentary, which aired last month, claimed that during Fayed's ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene but helped cover up abuse allegations. Responding to the investigation, Harrods' current owners said they were \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the allegations and that his victims had been failed - for which the store sincerely apologised.

    "A man was found with a gunshot wound on Linton Road in Barking, said police\n\nA murder investigation has been launched after a man was fatally shot in east London. The Metropolitan Police was called to reports of a man injured in Linton Road, Barking, at about 04:35 BST on Sunday. Officers and the London Ambulance Service found a man, believed to be in his 30s, with a gunshot injury. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

    "How a woman murdered her parents and hid the secret for four years\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"You caught the bad guy\": McCullough's confession was captured on police bodycam footage\n\nVirginia McCullough knew why the police had smashed through her front door, but part of her wondered why it took them so long to discover she had murdered her parents. \"Cheer up, at least you've caught the bad guy,\" she calmly told the officers handcuffing her. Neighbours thought John and Lois McCullough had retired to the seaside, but the reality was they were callously poisoned by their daughter. Why did she do it? The goings-on inside the McCullough family home in Great Baddow near Chelmsford, Essex, were becoming increasingly secretive in 2019. Relatives were asked to stay away and friends were told Mr and Mrs McCullough had retired to the Clacton area on Essex's sunshine coast. The gruesome reality was very different. It would be four years before anyone found out the horrors that took place behind closed doors on Pump Hill. John McCullough, a retired business studies lecturer, had been fatally poisoned and the 70-year-old's body was hidden in a crudely-built tomb made out of breeze blocks and blankets. The corpse of his 71-year-old wife, Lois, was stashed behind sleeping bags and duvets in an upstairs wardrobe. Mrs McCullough had been battered with a hammer and stabbed, but she too had also been poisoned with prescription medication administered by her daughter. Virginia McCullough, 36, was handed a life sentence at Chelmsford Crown Court for their murders, to serve a minimum of 36 years, on Friday.\n\n\"The curtains were always drawn and you couldn't see if anybody was in the house,\" said Phil Sargeant, who lived next door to the McCulloughs for 20 years. \"They were just like shadows, they'd move very quickly from A to B.\" Mr Sargeant now knows why there was such secrecy at his neighbours' house. \"I find it quite difficult even to say that Virginia murdered her parents or killed her parents,\" he added. \"She\u2019d come across as quite pleasant; she was funny, she was irreverent as well. She had a dark sense of humour.\"\n\nIn September 2023, Essex Police took a call from Essex County Council's safeguarding team. A GP at Mr and Mrs McCullough's registered practice had raised a concern for their welfare, having not seen them for some time.\n\nThe corpses of Mr and Mrs McCullough lay inside the family home for four years\n\nJohn McCullough's body was hidden in a makeshift tomb, covered with blankets and paintings\n\nTheir absences had been explained by their daughter, who offered a range of excuses for each appointment she cancelled on her parents' behalf. Conveniently for her, the country had been in Covid-enforced lockdowns for a large period of time they had not been seen. But when police spoke to McCullough, it became clear something was not adding up - why were her parents always out of the area? Alan Thomson, who rented a television to the McCulloughs, also had his suspicions. It followed a phone call from McCullough, abruptly cancelling the rental on her parents' behalf. When Mr Thomson's staff arrived at the family home to pick it up, they were told they could not enter the property - and the TV was already prepared by the front door. \"I got the feeling perhaps she was a bit of a fantasist, but no way would I have thought she\u2019d be a murderer,\" he said.\n\nWhen police raided the property, it was not the first time they had visited. Weeks prior to the discovery of the bodies, McCullough invited officers inside to discuss an allegation of an assault against her. Only she knew the intent of this call, but some believed she was testing the water. Ultimately, the assault allegation came to nothing.\n\nPost-mortem examinations found Mrs McCullough died of stab wounds and her husband was fatally poisoned, although both had been poisoned\n\nMcCullough was more forthcoming when officers returned in September 2023. \"I did know that this day would come eventually,\" she confessed. \"I deserve to get what's coming, sentence-wise, because that's the right thing to do and then that might give me a bit of peace.\" Documents recovered inside the property painted a picture of a woman desperately trying to keep her parents from discovering a financial black hole she had dug. Abusing their goodwill, she had been living rent free, spending their money and racking up large credit card debts in their names. Forged letters showed McCullough had been tricking her parents into thinking they had lost money through scams. In reality, it was money \"frittered away\" by their daughter.\n\nVirginia McCullough continued to spend her parents' pensions after murdering them\n\nTo them, she was well-qualified, suitably employed and working hard towards becoming an artist - a future she claimed would also bring financial benefits for her parents. Instead, she was reaping the financial rewards of manipulating, abusing and taking advantage of her parents' kindness. In total, McCullough benefited from \u00a3149,697 as a result of murdering her parents - combined from their pensions and spending on their credit cards, as well as selling assets. The court also heard she spent \u00a321,000 on online gambling between 2019 and 2023. Her lies - and the fear of being exposed - ultimately led to her cruelly killing her parents.\n\nThe McCullough family home has since been blocked up with metal security barriers\n\nPaul Hastings, a greengrocer at the Vineyards shopping centre near their home, had also noticed their disappearance. He was told by McCullough that her parents, who used to purchase goods from his shop, were no longer living in Great Baddow. Mr Hastings said her peculiar nature meant she could say things without arousing much suspicion. \"She came in to the shop and said 'The police are after me, they think I killed my mum and dad',\" Mr Hastings said. \"I thought 'That\u2019s a bit odd' but didn\u2019t think anything else of it, I just thought it was her eccentric nature.\" He explained McCullough would sometimes visit his shop four times a day, before disappearing for the next fortnight.\n\nVirginia McCullough was \"clearly taking advantage of her parents\u2019 goodwill\", Det Supt Rob Kirby said\n\nDebbie Pollard said McCullough would visit the flower shop she ran and bombard her with food and presents. \"We knew she was odd but I would never have dreamt she would ever be capable of doing what she actually did,\" she said. \"She\u2019s actually lived in that house all those years with her mum and dad\u2019s remains in there - that horrifies me. Horrifies me.\" Both Mr Hastings and Ms Pollard said McCullough had also pretended to be pregnant, even creating a fake bump under her clothing.\n\nDet Supt Rob Kirby said: \"The details of this case shock and horrify even the most experienced of murder detectives.\"\n\nThroughout her sentencing on Friday, McCullough stared at the floor, emotionless. It was only when she listened back to her interview with police, describing how she murdered her mother, that she began to weep. \"She looked so innocent; she was just sat there listening to the radio,\" McCullough told the officers. \"I did go in three times to build up some gumption but I knew I had to get it done and can\u2019t hesitate. \"She was just staring at me in disbelief.\"\n\nVirginia McCullough was jailed for life on Friday, to serve a minimum of 36 years behind bars\n\nDet Supt Rob Kirby, from Essex Police, said her otherwise composed reaction in court was typical of the \"considered, meticulous\" murderer she was. \"Throughout the course of our investigation, we have built a picture of the vast levels of deceit, betrayal and fraud she engaged in,\" he said. \"It was on a shocking and monumental scale. \"McCullough lied about almost every aspect of her life, maintaining a charade to deceive everyone close to her and clearly taking advantage of her parents\u2019 good will. \u201cShe is an intelligent and adept manipulator who chose to kill her parents callously and without a thought for them or those who continue to suffer as a result of their loss.\"\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Essex?",
    "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it \u201cAmerica First\u201d. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington\u2019s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\n\nNato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.\n\u2022 None What Chinese people want from the US The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

    "David Cameron has urged the UK to consider sanctioning two Israeli ministers as a way of \"putting pressure\" on the country to act within international law. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the former Conservative foreign secretary said before the election he had been \"working up\" plans to put sanctions on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. He described the two men as \"extremist\" and said using sanctions would send a message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that \"this is not good enough and has to stop\". The BBC has contacted Smotrich and Ben-Gvir for a response.\n\nLord Cameron said both men had \"said things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into Gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the West Bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out\". Earlier this year, Smotrich suggested it might be \"justified and moral\" to starve Gazans and has called for Palestinian residents to leave and make way for Israelis who could \"make the desert bloom\". Asked why the planned sanctions did not go ahead, Lord Cameron, who was foreign secretary between 2023 and 2024, said he had been advised that it would have been \"too much of a political act\" during the election. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned comments by the Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as \"entirely unacceptable\". Speaking at a Labour conference event, external last month, he said: \"We are very worried about escalatory behaviour, about inflamed tensions. \"I\u2019m absolutely clear, if we have to act, we will act. I\u2019m in discussions with G7 partners, particularly European partners, on that. I\u2019m not announcing further sanctions today but that is kept under close review.\" Asked in Parliament about sanctioning the Be-Gvir and Smotrich, Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said that the government kept its sanctions regime \"closely under review\" and would announce any changes.\n\nItamar Ben-Gvir (L) and Bezalel Smotrich (R) are part of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition in the Israeli parliament\n\nWhitehall sources have told the BBC that Lord Cameron's plan to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on both men had been well advanced and ready to go. The imposition of sanctions requires a detailed and legally binding case which takes time to compile. But they said the decision was put on hold for fear of inflaming political tensions during campaigning for the general election. There were concerns about triggering violence in constituencies where views about the Middle East were polarised. It is also understood the United States at the time opposed sanctioning Mr Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The UK tends to impose sanctions alongside US and the European Union to maximise their impact. The Foreign Office never comments on or predicts future sanctions decisions; however, some sources said any decision on sanctioning the two Israeli ministers might be delayed until after the US election. They also said that with such little UK leverage over Israel, domestic political factors may play a bigger part in any decision. Labour has already restricted UK arms sales to Israel, refunded the UN agency helping Palestinians, and lifted opposition to the International Criminal Court having the right to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.\n\nAnother decision against the Israeli government might be seen as one step too far. The sources also said there was the risk UK sanctions could be seen as a badge of honour by the two ministers. Tom Keatinge, from the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told the BBC that putting sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would be a \"significant move\" aimed at sending a \"major political message\" to Israel. He also said there was \"not a precedent\" for the UK government sanctioning elements of an ally country. He added that there were \"practical issues\" as sanctions required \"a lot of work\" and that the Foreign Office's sanctions director was already \"heavily overworked\" due to issues related to Russia. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office announced new sanctions targeted at illegal settler outposts and four organisations it said had \"supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank\". The three settler outposts hit by the financial restrictions are Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost, Meitarim Outpost, and Shuvi Eretz Outpost. The four organisations targeted are Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva, a religious school; Hashomer Yosh, a non-governmental organisation that provides volunteers for illegal outposts; Torat Lechima, an Israeli charity and Amana, a construction company that has overseen the establishment of outposts. The announcement follows previous sanctions announced in February, external and May., external The foreign secretary said the measures would \"help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights\".\n\nLord Cameron argued the UK government should seek to influence Israel by putting restrictions on some of its ministers instead of pursuing the \"wrong path\" of suspending arms exports. Last month, the UK government restricted arms sales to Israel saying there was a \"clear risk\" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. But Lord Cameron said restricting arms sales to Israel while simultaneously helping to protect the country from Iranian attacks \"made no sense\". The former PM said everyone wanted to see the conflict end, but \"end in a sustainable way\". He said Israel had faced attacks from Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north and it was right to back the country's right to self-defence. \"But it is not a blank cheque, it is not unconditional,\" he said. \"We do want to make sure aid gets through into Gaza, we do want to see the role of the UN in Lebanon to be respected.\"",

    "Woman who starved to death was unlawfully killed\n\nDebbie Leitch's deterioation was concealed by her mother a coroner says\n\nA woman who starved to death after being neglected by her mother was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded. Debbie Leitch, 24, who had Down's syndrome, was found dead at her home in South Shore, Blackpool, on 29 August 2019. Alan Wilson, senior coroner for Blackpool and Fylde, said Debbie died from \"the combined effects of her severely emaciated and neglected state, and debilitation caused by widespread Norwegian scabies mite infection\". Her mother and full-time paid carer Elaine Clarke, who was jailed in 2022 for gross negligence manslaughter, refused to give evidence at the inquest.\n\nElaine Clarke refused to give evidence at the inquest\n\nIn his ruling Mr Wilson stated: \"Debbie [...] had care and support needs, and a range of carers and social care professionals would attend the home regularly to provide that care. \"Unbeknown to them, the standard of care shown by Debbie's mother was at times inappropriate, and she would take steps to actively try to mask how she was treating Debbie.\" He added: \"At other times, she may use disguised compliance to give professionals the false impression that she was doing what she could to comply with any plans to safeguard or promote Debbie's welfare when this was not the case, such as by agreeing to medical appointments which would then be missed, often providing a seemingly plausible explanation.\" Mr Wilson said when Debbie's cousin raised concerns after visiting the family home on 26 July 2019 with social services and her GP practice but by the time the GP arrived, Clarke had \"taken steps to make both Debbie and the house more presentable, and she reassured the GP that Debbie was being appropriately cared for\".\n\nSix days later, a visiting social worker attending the home \"was similarly reassured\". The coroner said Debbie was significantly neglected over the following weeks, remaining largely in her room. On 29 August, emergency services were called to the house and found Debbie lying on her bedroom floor. She had been dead for a number of hours. Mr Wilson said: \"The conditions in which she had been living were described as uninhabitable. \"As a result of the way she had been neglected over the preceding four weeks, a subsequent post mortem examination revealed she died from the combined effects of her severely emaciated and neglected state, and debilitation caused by widespread Norwegian scabies mite infection, which is regarded as a treatable condition. \"Significantly, the fact that Debbie had Down's Syndrome, a learning disability, made it more likely that her mother would be able to persuade others she was providing an acceptable level of care for Debbie.\"",
    "Smart meters enable people to monitor their electricity and gas use\n\nThe way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told. The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers. The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills. The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC. In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers. But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies. It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d. The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan. By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed. As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.\n\nHartesh Battu says he has had six different smart meters and none of them have worked\n\nThe cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly. As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights. Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place. Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car. His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d\n\nWhen the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily. But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us. She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland. This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama. One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date. \u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.\n\nSmart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story? Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).\n\nEnergy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita. Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead. However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d. Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed. It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d. In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits. Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills. The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly. The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d. It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly in, the north. Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home.\n\nDo you use a smart energy meter?

    "Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"very pleased\" MPs will get the chance to debate and vote on the issue of assisted dying. The prime minister confirmed his government would remain neutral on the subject and that his MPs would be given a free vote, rather than having to follow a party line. Asked how he would vote, Sir Keir said his views were \"pretty well known\" but that he would look at the details of the bill being proposed. In 2015, Sir Keir supported an assisted dying bill and last year told reporters: \"I personally do think there are grounds for changing the law\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, Labour MP Kim Leadbeater confirmed she would introduce a bill giving terminally ill people in England and Wales the right to choose to end their life. Leadbeater's bill has yet to be finalised but is likely to be similar to Lord Falconer's proposal which would give terminally ill adults with six months or fewer to get medical help to end their own lives. Assisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Assisted dying is generally used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves.\n\nBackbench MPs do not normally get time in Parliament for their bills to be debated, but the Spen Valley MP's proposal will be allotted space after she came first in a ballot. The bill is expected to be formally introduced in Parliament on 16 October, and a debate could take place within weeks. Even if it is approved at an initial vote, the bill would still be debated at further stages in the parliamentary process. It would also need to be agreed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, before becoming law. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former paralympian and crossbench peer in the House of Lords, said she had concerns \"about the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis\". However, broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has been calling for change, welcomed the bill, telling the BBC: \"All I\u2019m asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice. \"If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die. It\u2019s a choice.\" The Childline founder has lung cancer and last year said she had joined Dignitas, the assisted dying clinic in Switzerland.\n\nDame Esther Rantzen has called for the law to change\n\nAsked about the issue during a visit to Liverpool, Sir Keir said: \"I made a promise to Esther Rantzen before the election that we would provide time for a debate and vote, but that it will be a free vote, and obviously that opportunity has now arisen.\" He added: \"I'm very pleased... that I'm able to make good on that promise to Esther Rantzen.\" Asked by BBC North West Tonight if he would vote in favour of changing the law, Sir Keir said: \"I think my views are pretty well know. Obviously I\u2019ll look at the detail of whatever legislation is proposed. But the government will be neutral.\"\n\nIt is not easy to predict how MPs will vote on Leadbeater's bill. The last time MPs voted on the subject was nine years ago, and the make-up of the House of Commons has changed greatly since then. In 2015, MPs rejected a bill allowing some terminally ill adults to end their lives with medical supervision by 300 votes to 118. Sir Keir was among the MPs backing a change, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson all opposed the bill. Health Secretary Wes Streeting voted in favour in 2015 but is now understood to be \"conflicted\" on the subject. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Breakfast he would vote in favour of the assisted dying bill and described the current law as \"cruel\".",
    "Almost \u00a31bn in funding will go to delivering London-style buses across England as part of a massive Budget boost, the government has promised. The Department for Transport (DfT) has given more details on its plans for 2025 after announcing the funding last month. It has promised to deliver what it calls \"London-style\" services to every corner of the country, and said funding would be allocated based on levels of deprivation and population, instead of making areas compete for investment as it has in previous years. The DfT says Leicester, the Isle of Wight, Torbay, Southend, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are set to receive \"unprecedented\" levels of funding.\n\nIn urban areas, some of the biggest allocations are being given to combined authorities representing South Yorkshire and the Liverpool City Region. In total, there will be \u00a3712m for local authorities to improve services, alongside a further \u00a3243m for bus operators. About 3.4 million people in England travel regularly by bus, making it the most commonly used mode of public transport. Local authorities in all English regions will be able to introduce new bus routes, make services more frequent and protect crucial routes, the DfT says. It added the money will allow more urban areas to maintain high levels of service. Meanwhile, rural communities and small towns will be able to offer more services. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the funding would \"vastly improve\" the reliability and frequency of services, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of the Buses Bill, which aims to give local transport authorities across England new powers to take control of bus services. Under the plans, local authorities would be allowed to introduce a London-style franchising system, meaning they can decide routes, timetables and fares, with operators bidding to run the services for a fixed fee. The government has also pledged to remove a ban on publicly owned bus companies. An extra \u00a3151m will also fund a cap in single bus fares outside London, which rose to \u00a33 last month, until the end of 2025. The Liberal Democrats have called for the government to U-turn on the decision to raise the cap, with the party saying it will hit both commuters and local businesses. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said on Friday: \"The fare cap increase is like a bus tax for people across the country, impacting bus users and commuters already struggling to make ends meet. \"MPs must be given a say on this bus fare hike on behalf of their constituents.\" Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Labour have chosen to increase bus fares by 50% in a further attack on rural communities, working people and pensioners. \"They didn\u2019t have the courage to tell people their plans in the election. This is another broken promise that raises costs on working people.\" But the DfT said the fare cap introduced by the previous Conservative government was due to expire at the end of 2024 and some fares would have soared unless it intervened. \u201cFares will only be allowed to increase with inflation in the normal way, and the \u00a33 bus fare cap will lead to savings of up to 80% on some routes, keeping bus tickets affordable across the country,\" it said.\n\u2022 None More bus services could come under control of councils",
    "Robert Jenrick has accepted the job of shadow justice secretary in Kemi Badenoch's senior team, the BBC understands. The new Tory leader is also expected to name Dame Priti Patel as her shadow foreign secretary and Mel Stride as her shadow chancellor. Dame Priti, Stride and Jenrick were all candidates against Badenoch in the Tory leadership race, with Badenoch beating Jenrick in the final round. By appointing not only former rivals but also figures from different wings of the party, Badenoch will be hoping to unite the Conservatives after a bruising election defeat.\n\nHowever, there was wrangling over which, if any, job Jenrick would take and during negotiations one Conservative source, not close to the leadership, told the BBC: \"Kemi just doesn\u2019t like Rob. She thinks his whole schtick about her and whether she has any policies has done her lasting damage with the right and with Reform voters. \"This is only likely to further unravel.\"\n\nThe pair clashed during the final weeks of the leadership campaign, with Jenrick accusing Badenoch of being \"disrespectful\" to Tory members by failing to set out policies. Badenoch said she would not have used that word and, defending her own approach, said she would not make a promise \"unless I know how I am going to deliver it\". However, following the conclusion of the contest the two candidates exchanged warm words. In her victory speech on Saturday, Badenoch praised Jenrick\u2019s \"energy and determination\", adding: \"You and I know that we don't actually disagree on very much, and I have no doubt that you have a key role to play in our party for many years to come.\" Jenrick in turn congratulated his opponent on her win and urged Conservatives to unite behind the new leader. On Monday, a friend of Jenrick's said: \"Rob thinks the party needs to come together and take the fight to Labour. \"Unity could not be more important. He\u2019s eager to expose Labour\u2019s dreadful record on law and order.\" A formal announcement of Badenoch's full shadow cabinet is expected before its first meeting on Tuesday. Former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott has been given the job of shadow education secretary, with Neil O'Brien appointed shadow education minister. Trott and O'Brien have already appeared in their new roles in the House of Commons at Education Questions. Nigel Huddleston and Lord Dominic Johnson have also been appointed as joint chairmen of the Conservative party, the BBC understands. It follows the appointment of Castle Point MP Dame Rebecca Harris as Tory chief whip on Sunday evening.\n\nThe new shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti, has represented the Essex constituency of Witham since 2010 and served in several government departments during the Conservatives\u2019 time in power. She was forced to resign as international development secretary in 2017 following unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials but was brought back into government by Boris Johnson, who gave her the senior role of home secretary. At the Home Office she started the Rwanda policy, which aimed to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats by deporting them to the East African country but was later scrapped by the new Labour government. A prominent Brexit supporter, she is seen as being on the right of the party. By contrast Stride comes more from the left. Like Dame Priti he joined Parliament in 2010, winning the constituency of Central Devon, and has served in several government departments. A close ally of Rishi Sunak, he was given the job of work and pensions secretary and during the general election was trusted to do frequent media appearances. On Sunday Badenoch told the BBC she thought taxes had been too high under Sunak but has now given one of his most prominent supporters the much sought-after role of shadow chancellor.\n\nLaura Trott served as chief secretary to the Treasury in the Sunak government\n\nNew shadow education secretary Laura Trott has been MP for Sevenoaks in Kent since 2019, and served as number two in the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt when he was chancellor. Neil O'Brien has been MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston since 2017 and was most recently a health minister. He resigned from Sunak's government in November 2023 and took a more critical stance on the then-prime minister from the backbenches. While Trott and Huddleston supported Badenoch in the leadership, O'Brien had supported her rival Jenrick. The current Labour government has 120 ministers, meaning the Tories may struggle to shadow all posts given they only have 121 MPs. Former Home Secretary and defeated leadership candidate James Cleverly last week ruled out serving in the shadow cabinet, telling the FT, external he had been \"liberated\" from 16 years on the political front line and was now \"not particularly in the mood to be boxed back into a narrow band again\". Former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, former Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, former Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell and former Environment Secretary Steve Barclay have also said they will return to the backbenches and not serve in the new shadow cabinet.",
    "Callum Tindal-Draper's family said they have been told their son died on 5 November\n\nA family has paid tribute to their son who has been killed in Ukraine, saying they \"begged him not to go\" but he wanted to help. Callum Tindal-Draper's family said they were informed by the 4th International Legion that the 22-year-old from Cornwall had been killed in action while the foreign volunteer platoon defended an observation point on 5 November. His father Steven Draper said the family were proud of their \"brave\" son, who had told them before going to Ukraine in June he knew the risks he would face and the chances of him coming home were slim. The Foreign Office said: \"We are aware that a British national has reportedly died in Ukraine and stand ready to assist the family in the UK.\"\n\nCallum Tindal-Draper's father Steven said his son wanted to 'stand up to bullies'\n\nForeign Office advice has urged people not to travel to Ukraine while the country is in conflict with Russia. Mr Draper said the family, who live in Gunnislake in Cornwall, had tried to convince his son not to travel out to Ukraine. However, he said once Mr Tindal-Draper had told them he was going out to help no matter what, the family fully supported him with the plan as they knew how passionate he was about it. \"We begged and begged and begged him not to go,\" Mr Draper said. \"But Callum said 'dad, I'm not frightened of bullies and what's going on in Ukraine is awful and someone needs to stand up for these people'.\"\n\nCallum Tindal-Draper's family said they were very proud of him\n\nHis mother Caroline Tindal said the family were all \"so proud\" of Mr Tindal-Draper, who had previously worked at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and as a carer in the community. She went out to visit her son in Ukraine in September and said she noticed he had matured as a person. \"It was such a transformation and he said to me 'mum, coming out here was the best thing that ever happened to me, I've found who I was meant to be',\" Ms Tindal said. \"He found who he was meant to be, he became that person and he lived it.\"\n\nShe added Mr Tindal-Draper's battalion had told the family in video messages and handwritten letters they held him in high-esteem and he was an inspiration to them in Ukraine. Ms Tindal said: \"When we found out he'd died, there was just this hole which I can't describe and it's always going to be there. \"But to know that they are saying he inspired them and they called him their little brother because he was the youngest one out there, they really were a family unit, and that is helping heal us and helping us get by. \"Already that hole I thought could not be mended is being filled with overwhelming love from his family out there and it means so much.\"\n\nSteven Draper and Caroline Tindal said Callum's comrades sent them handwritten notes to say what an inspiration their son was\n\nMr Draper said the hole left by his son's death was \"crushing\", but he was filling it with pride from listening to what his comrades had said to the family. He added: \"It's inspiring me to go out and think what can I do and how can I be as brave and courageous in the things that I do. \"I've got the bravest of the brave as a son as an inspiration and that's really powerful.\" Ms Tindal said the family have not had Mr Tindal-Draper's body back yet, but the family have plans to bury him in Ukraine. She said: \"He wanted to stay in Ukraine and live in Ukraine, so I think even if we had the body we would bury him in Ukraine - that's where he found his home.\"\n\nA tribute to Mr Tindal-Draper has also been paid by Duchy College, where he had been part of its Military and Protective Services Academy. In a Facebook post, external from the academy, Mr Tindal-Draper was described as a \"passionate, articulate and bright student\" who had a strong moral compass. \"He was well liked and respected by his peers, and was not one to shy away from causes he believed in and was instrumental in collecting the three minibus loads of equipment that the learners gathered when the war in Ukraine initially kicked off,\" the post said. \"Callum truly believed in his sense of duty and after working for the NHS after the course, decided it was his duty to help Ukraine and joined the International Legion of Ukraine in the summer.\" It added Mr Tindal-Draper would be commemorated during services being held on Sunday and Monday to mark Remembrance Day.",
    "Why are we building homes when so many are standing empty?\n\nIn an average working day, Claudia Bowring has to play the role of detective, estate agent, family mediator and, occasionally, grief counsellor. She\u2019s an empty homes officer for a borough council in the suburbs of Nottingham. There are just short of 700,000 empty and unfurnished homes in England, according to the most recent government figures, external. Of those, 261,471 are classed as \u201clong-term empty,\u201d meaning no-one has lived there for six months or more. If all empty homes were brought back into use, the housing crisis would be solved at a stroke and, arguably, the government would not have to build 1.5m new homes. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not as simple as that. Bringing derelict and abandoned properties back to life can be a long and complex process. Even finding out who owns properties that have been standing empty for years, or in some cases decades, can be a challenge. Ms Bowring regularly uses a genealogist to track down the owners of long-abandoned houses on her patch in Rushcliffe. They are not always happy to be reminded of their responsibilities. \u201cIn some cases, people don\u2019t really understand the seriousness of their property being empty,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think \u2018well, it\u2019s my house, there is nothing the council can say or do to make me change my mind.\u2019\u201d Often homes become empty when the owners pass away, leading to a long administrative process known as probate, when their assets are divided up. Once that has been settled, families can still be reluctant to part with a property. Claudia Bowring is facing this problem with one of the houses on her patch. \u201cThe children have grown up there, their mum\u2019s died and left them the house, and emotionally they feel quite attached to the property, and me suggesting they should get rid of it or have it for rental is quite difficult to hear. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see someone else living in the property. They\u2019ve got trees that they planted in the garden when they were children, and they don\u2019t want someone coming in and ripping those up.\u201d When persuasion fails, the gloves come off.\n\nLike many local authorities, Conservative-controlled Rushcliffe charges extra council tax on homes that have been unoccupied for more than a year, under the Empty Homes Premium brought in by the previous government. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, the council can take enforcement action. It treats abandoned properties as an environmental health issue - derelict properties can be a magnet for vandalism and vermin, harming the quality of life for people living next to them. In some cases, the council is able to carry out emergency repair work on abandoned homes, and then force a sale at auction to recover its costs. This sometimes results in a windfall for the owners who were so reluctant to sell up in the first place. Another tool at the council\u2019s disposal are Empty Dwelling Management Orders, which give councils the right to take over and make repairs to run-down private properties that have been vacant for at least two years. They can rent the property out for up to seven years to recover costs.\n\nClaudia Bowring keeps an eye out for homes that can be brought back to life\n\nRushcliffe has used these tools and others to bring a modest but steady flow of properties back into use since it started taking the issue seriously in 2019. But it does not have to do this. There is no legal requirement for local authorities to bring empty homes back into use \u2013 and some councils choose not to. Rushcliffe is motivated by a desire to improve the quality of life for its residents and ease the housing shortage. But unlike many councils around the country, it is not in financial trouble \u2013 and does not have a serious homelessness problem. For some hard-pressed authorities \u201cempty homes work is a luxury,\u201d says housing expert Adam Cliff. \u201cIt is not against the law to own an empty property,\u201d he adds, and \u201cdifferent councils have different priorities\u201d. As secretary of professional support group the Empty Homes Network, he wants to raise the profile of empty homes among the public and politicians, as an alternative to building on the green belt land. He argues that there needs to be a central government programme, with a \u201cpot of money for councils to dip into as and when they need money to carry out enforcement,\u201d along the lines of a scheme operated by the Welsh government.\n\nAbandoned homes can be a blight on the neighbourhood\n\nProbate law needs to be reformed to prevent properties \u201csitting empty in perpetuity,\u201d he adds, but above all he believes empty homes need to be put back in the spotlight as a national issue. Campaign group Shelter is also concerned about the growing number of privately-owned empty properties, even if its main focus is on getting more social-rented homes built. Chief executive Polly Neate said: \u201cWe desperately need more genuinely affordable social homes and if the government is serious about its commitment to deliver them, it must do more to bring long-term empty homes back into use. \u201cConverting empty homes is not the silver bullet to ending the housing emergency, but it offers a cost-effective and green way to get more social rent homes built.\u201d Last year, Shelter produced a 10-city plan to rapidly convert 10,500 empty homes, external in the first three years of a new government. But the issue was rarely mentioned during the general election campaign, with only the Green Party putting it in their manifesto. And so far, there are few signs the Labour government regards it as a priority. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"Councils have a range of tools at their disposal to bring empty homes back into use, including charging additional council tax on vacant properties. \u201cWe are committed to building 1.5 million homes and delivering the biggest increase in social and affordable housing in a generation. This will unlock thousands of homes and make the dream of homeownership a reality for more people across the country.\u201d People working with empty homes all seem to have a strong sense of vocation. Adam Cliff said he first got interested in the issue as a teenager, and wrote his university dissertation on it. Claudia Bowring talks about the satisfaction she gets from putting life back into \u201cdead properties\u201d. But with little apparent interest from central government, and council budgets being squeezed, they are unlikely to be joined by new colleagues in the field any time soon.",
    "The Roman archaeological site of Pompeii will limit the number of daily visitors to the site to 20,000 a day after a steep rise in visitors. A record high 36,000 tourists visited the site on the first Sunday of October, when entry was free, local media reported. The park\u2019s management said on Friday that the site would cap its daily visitor number from 15 November. Pompeii, the ancient city buried in an eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in AD79, is one of the best-preserved Roman sites anywhere in the world.\n\nPompeii and its Roman inhabitants were buried in a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius\n\nNearly four million people, external visited the main Pompeii site in 2023, a third more than the previous year. Visitor counts had been climbing in the run up to the pandemic and in 2023 were above pre-Covid levels. In October 2024, there were more than 480,000 visitors, putting the average at about 15,500 a day. The busiest month so far this year was May, when about 517,000 people visited, or some 16,700 a day. The 20,000 cap is likely to only lead to tourists being turned away on a handful of occasions. A spokesperson for the park told Reuters that it had only exceeded 20,000 visitors when entry is free on the first Sunday of the month, as well as three or four fee-paying days.\n\nNearly 4 million people visited the main Pompeii site in 2023, a third more than the previous year\n\nGabriel Zuchtriegel, the park's director, said that reducing the effects of human visitors at Pompeii was important for conservation and safety reasons. The city was devastated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which preserved swathes of it almost intact under a layer of ash for over 1,000 years. About a third of the site has yet to be excavated. It continues to be of huge interest to archaeologists, providing the most complete picture of daily Roman life anywhere in the world. Earlier this year, archaeologists revealed frescos of mythical Greek figures including Helen of Troy and Apollo. The artworks were found in a banqueting hall with dramatic black walls and a mosaic floor made of more than 1 million white tiles.",
    "Workers have been warned their pay will be hit by Budget tax rises aimed at employers. Firms will bear the brunt of the Budget's \u00a340bn total tax rise due to an increase in the National Insurance rate for employers as well as a reduction in the threshold at which they start paying it. Businesses are likely to respond by holding back on pay rises, influential think tanks, the government's independent forecaster and the chancellor herself have all said. \"It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been,\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC.\n\nJames Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank which aims to improve living standards for low-to-middle income families, agreed. \"Even if it doesn't show up in pay packets from day one, it will eventually feed through to lower wages,\" he said. \"This is definitely a tax on working people, let's be very clear about that.\"\n\nOther Budget measures, including a big boost to spending on public services are expected to raise inflation in the short term, which could prevent interest rates falling more quickly. That will also have a knock-on effect on people's spending power. The government has pledged to make economic growth its priority and said people would have more \"pounds in their pockets\" by the end of the parliament. In its general election manifesto, Labour promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\" - explicitly ruling out a rise in VAT, National Insurance or income tax. The pledge has come under scrutiny, with some claiming that Labour have broken it with the rise in employer's National Insurance Contributions (NICs), something the government has denied. The Budget has sparked a debate over how much of the tax rise firms can absorb. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that by 2026-27, some 76% of the total cost of the NICs increase will be passed on through a squeeze on workers' pay rises and increased prices. The OBR expects that as a result of the Budget, average household income - which includes the impact of tax changes directly and indirectly, and benefits - will increase only slowly over the parliament.\n\nHowever, projected income growth is slightly faster than the 0.3% annual average between 2019 and 2024, a period which saw a series of economic blows including Brexit, the pandemic and energy price rises following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The effect of an ageing population is also putting more stress on public finances, especially through higher demand for health services. By 2028 real weekly wages - with price rises taken into account - will have grown by just \u00a313 over the past two decades, according to the Resolution Foundation.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the rise in employer NICs will affect larger firms hiring people on low wages the most, and could lead to fewer minimum wage jobs being available in future. It also warned that lower pay rises could mean the measure raises significantly less than a forecast \u00a325bn. It highlighted a forecast by the OBR that it could end up raising \"just\" \u00a316bn if, for example, businesses award smaller wage rises. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, also warned of likely further spending and tax increases part way through the parliament. He accused the chancellor of playing the \"same silly games\" as previous governments by \"pencilling in implausibly low spending increases for the future in order to make the fiscal arithmetic balance\". \"I suspect we\u2019ll end up with even more spending, possibly considerably more spending than is currently planned,\" he said. \"That will probably mean, unless she gets lucky with growth, more tax rises to come next year or the year after.\" Economic forecasts published by the OBR alongside the Budget suggest UK growth will pick up over the next two years, but then fall back to a more moderate pace, in large part due to Budget measures that are likely to push up prices and interest rates. Mr Johnson described the forecasts as \"pretty awful\".\n\nThe Resolution Foundation also warned that the decision to frontload increases to spending on public services into this year and next means the Spending Review in the Spring will be tough. Reeves has also left herself with a \"relatively slim margin of headroom\", it said. The chancellor's new debt rule allows more room for manoeuvre but most of that money has already been used up, which means that even a small economic downturn could force the government to increase taxes further in the future, the think tank said. Opposition parties were quick to criticise Reeves, with shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying she had taken the \u201ceasy route\u201d by \u201cpicking the pockets of businesses\u201d to fund public spending. He said the strategy would lead to \u201clower growth, lower living standards, lower wages, businesses employing fewer people. \u201cIt\u2019s businesses paying their taxes that pay for our public services and what we did not hear yesterday is a plan to grow the economy and that is what we need,\u201d he said. Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey said the chancellor was repeating the mistakes of her Conservative predecessors. \u201cRaising employer\u2019s National Insurance is a tax on jobs and High Streets, and it will make the health and care crisis worse by hitting thousands of small care providers,\u201d he said. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, said his government had taken a \"responsible\" approach in order to \"fix the foundations\" of the economy.",
    "Kat Booker said she felt told what to do, instead of being given neutral information during her pregnancy with Nancy\n\nA mum whose daughter has Down's syndrome said she felt \"pushed towards termination\" during her pregnancy. Kat Booker, 42, said information about her daughter Nancy's condition was \"very negative\" and made her feel \"horrendous\". Charity group Seren Dwt said language used in pregnancy could have a \"massive impact\" on experience. Antenatal Screening Wales said it was important information was offered in an \"unbiased and non-judgemental way\".\n\nMs Booker, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she felt she was being told what to do throughout her pregnancy, rather than being given information neutrally. \"I felt like I was being pushed towards termination, because it was the easier thing to do,\" she said. \"I was just being told how difficult everything was going to be and all the things that Nancy quite possibly wouldn\u2019t do, but not being given any other information as in there are children living quite happily with Down's syndrome.\"\n\nKat Booker said she had no doubts about her decision to carry on with her pregnancy\n\nShe said Nancy, four, was a \"dream\" who \"wears her out in the most fun way possible\". Born during the Covid-19 pandemic, she remembered being alone at appointments, needing more support. \"I couldn\u2019t really compute what was going on,\" she said. \"It was only after I left, and I was thinking about it, I got really quite angry about the way that I\u2019d been spoken to.\"\n\nOther mums of children with Down's syndrome said they had similar experiences. Laura Howard, mum to \"cheeky and feisty\" Tomos, four, said receiving his diagnosis after he was born felt \"very much like a bereavement situation\". \"We had a nurse coming in and being quite upset, saying 'oh, you\u2019re too nice a people to have this happen to you',\" she said. \"It\u2019s from good intentions that they\u2019re trying to say that, but it is still creating this whole negative situation around what is just a baby first and foremost.\"\n\nLaura Howard, Laura Thomas and Lou Kennedy (far right) set up a charity after their experiences of having babies with Down's syndrome\n\nAlong with two other mums - Lou Kennedy and Laura Thomas - she set up Seren Dwt, a charitable organisation gifting Welcome Boxes to babies with Down's syndrome across Wales. \"Having these boxes is saying there is a support group for you,\" Ms Howard said. \"You are not alone, and your child will be alright, there\u2019s lovely, positive things that they can achieve and there is a community ready and waiting with open arms for you.\" All three agreed language was incredibly important. \u201cI wish I could go back and tell myself two hours after she was born, when we realised, that you\u2019re going to be OK and she\u2019s going to be OK and life is not going to be doom and gloom,\u201d said Ms Kennedy.\n\nThe welcome boxes, which include knitted hats, cuddly toys and biscuits, are given as gifts to celebrate babies with Down's syndrome\n\nThe organisation provides the policies, standards, and framework to enable maternity services across Wales to provide screening tests, usually ultrasounds or blood tests, for those who choose to have them. She said their role was to ensure information was \"robust\" and \"evidence-based\", offered in an unbiased and non-judgmental way. \"For example, we would use language like 'probability' or 'chance'. We would not use the term 'risk'.\n\nSarah Fox says unbiased information should be given to expectant parents\n\n\"We would talk about 'conditions' not 'diseases',\" she explained. Ms Fox said they trained all student midwives around how to verbally offer screening tests, as well as providing written information in different formats. It is just one part of the entire maternity care system, but she said she understood the need to listen to feedback. \"We are up for the challenge. \"We want to consistently improve and make better training and collaborate more closely with maternity services and with families to make sure that the training is fit for purpose, and the information is fit for purpose to enable that unbiased, informed choice.\"\n\nGareth Thomas, a sociologist at Cardiff University University, has done extensive research with healthcare professionals, and written a book about the language around disability in pregnancy and antenatal care. He said he wanted to see \"why we're so invested in screening and how it affects healthcare professionals, as well as expectant parents\". He said it was simplistic and offensive to blame staff, when so many are \"conscientious\" and the \"victims of various pressures, not least time\". His research from 2017 found the term \"risk\" was being used in clinics, which might suggest how deeply ingrained that discourse around disability is, in systems and society.",
    "Bradley Nelson was left with disabilities, after being shaken by his dad as a baby\n\nA boy left blind and brain-damaged after being attacked as a baby by his father has died in hospital, prompting a fresh police investigation. Bradley Nelson, nine, was left severely disabled and unable to walk after being assaulted by Darren Spreadbury in April 2016, when he was seven months old. Despite being born \"fit and well\" Bradley was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Nearly nine years later, Bradley, from Whitby, died at Scarborough General Hospital last month after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn May 2018, Spreadbury was sentenced to four years in prison, after scans found Bradley\u2019s brain injuries had been caused by shaken baby syndrome. \"Bradley was blind because he shook him that hard, he snapped his optic nerve and he had a can of Coke\u2019s worth of blood between his brain and his skull,\" Bradley's mum, Sharon Boocock, said. Doctors later determined he had suffered a brain injury that was \"unexplained and non-accidental\", leading to the arrest of Spreadbury. He pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was handed a 10-year restraining order, as well as being sent to prison.\n\nBradley underwent several operations in the years following the attack\n\nIn the years following the attack, Bradley needed \"24-hour care\" and was unable to walk, talk or feed himself, according to his mum. He underwent several operations and suffered complications and infections. Ms Boocock said her life at the time was devoted to staying in to look after Bradley. \"I couldn\u2019t go anywhere after 17:00 because Bradley would come home from school and that was me housebound,\" she said. She explained how she had juggled her job as a bartender to earn \"whatever money she could\" and said she was \"learning to live again\". Last month, Bradley was sent home from school after complaining about feeling sleepy. He was taken in to hospital and Ms Boocock and her partner, Jonny Nelson, were told he had suffered a seizure after falling unconscious. Bradley died on 22 October after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nBradley was described by his mum as \"always smiling and happy\"\n\nSharon said, despite everything, Bradley had been \"always smiling and happy\". Last week, police informed her they were investigating the cause of his death. A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: \"We have been made aware of the death of a nine-year-old boy from the Whitby area, who sadly passed away in hospital on October 22. \"The child had complex medical needs and an investigation into the cause of his death is currently under way, reflecting due process in such circumstances.\" A fundraiser has been launched on GoFundMe by Sharon\u2019s friends to help cover Bradley\u2019s funeral costs.

    "Janette Ward consults a paper timetable at her bus stop - she says the tracking app can be unreliable\n\nThe 12:40 bus has just driven past Janette Ward\u2019s stop seven minutes early as she watches from the other side of the road, waiting to cross. There won\u2019t be another for two hours. \u201cIt makes it very difficult when you\u2019re going for an appointment or you\u2019re connecting to a rail service or other bus service,\u201d says Ms Ward, 74. There\u2019s also been further changes to make her journey more complicated, she says. Janette now has to take four buses to see her daughter in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Before, she only needed to change buses once. Her situation is by no means unique. The frequency of rural bus services in England has reached a historic low, according to a report by the County Councils Network. They found more than a quarter of rural routes had been lost over the decade to 2023.\n\nAnd last week's UK Budget revealed that the \u00a32 cap on bus fares in much of England will increase by \u00a31. It could mean an extra \u00a340 a month for someone who gets a return five days a week. Since then dozens of people have got in touch with BBC News, many saying that buses remain fundamentally unreliable. Some passengers say there's a lack of digital screens at bus stops and live app updates for some routes outside of cities, unlike trains and Ubers where many are used to tracking journeys in real time.\n\u2022 None What issues really matter to you? Let us know\n\nAnd even where tracking exists, it can sometimes be out of date. Take Leeds, for example, where some locals claim they've had to endure \u201cghost buses\u201d - they\u2019re advertised as coming on live displays at bus stops, but never do. \u201cFor people who rely on the bus as their only means of getting to work it\u2019s impossibly frustrating,\u201d says Cllr Eleanor Thomson, who runs a Facebook group for bus passengers in the Yorkshire city. \u201cSome people in the area have moved because they\u2019re that fed up of it, or they\u2019ve bought a car, which is costing them a lot of money.\u201d Bus operators told the local authority in January they\u2019re installing 4G technology to improve tracking, but Cllr Thomson says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be getting any better\u201d.\n\nJanette Ward relies on her local bus to see her daughter and go to appointments\n\nJanette has similar experiences of unreliable service updates in Hereford. \u201cOn bank holidays, sometimes the tracking service doesn\u2019t know if a bus is coming at all,\u201d she says. Campaigners think bringing the entire bus network into the 21st Century would give people more confidence in the service and make them more likely to use it. \u201cIf you know that your bus is coming in five minutes, then you know you have that certainty,\u201d says Silviya Barrett, director of policy and research from the Campaign for Better Transport. \u201cWhereas in some bus stops there isn't even the basic timetable, let alone the live arrival updates.\u201d\n\nDoreen Gower, who doesn\u2019t drive, uses the bus regularly to attend hospital appointments in Hereford. Now that her service only runs once every two hours, she feels she sometimes has to find alternatives because of the inconvenience. \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling very well, you don\u2019t particularly want to have to wait for another two hours for a bus. It means that I maybe have to pay \u00a325 for a taxi to get me home,\u201d she tells us. She also relies on volunteers, who provide a ring-and-ride service, to bring her to and from her local GP surgery in a neighbouring village around 20 minutes away.\n\nAs well as passengers, poor rural bus services are costing employers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty grim, some businesses are completely cut off from public transport,\u201d says Natalie Fryer, who has been appointed by Cumbria\u2019s tourism board to improve the situation. \u201cEmployees are walking down dark roads from their closest bus stops or train stations, with employers concerned for their safety. Some businesses say they put up staff in their own homes just so they can stay open.\u201d In an attempt to work around the problem, Gilpin Hotel, which lies in the heart of the Lake District, spends \u00a38,000 per month on taxis bringing some of its 137 staff to and from work. Many don't drive, a common occurrence in the hospitality sector. Helen Tappenden, who oversees personnel at the hotel, says the business has to \"put our hand in our pocket\" to avoid recruitment and retention problems. \u201cFor our staff it can feel very isolating because, while they might love working here, without a bus route they struggle to have some normality - like popping to a coffee shop or a cinema,\" she tells the BBC. And 40 miles away at Muncaster Castle - which is popular with visitors and wedding guests - Ewan Frost-Pennington lets some staff stay in a house on the grounds because of the lack of transport connections. \"That's got six young people living in it, of which I think two can drive,\" says Ewan, whose family have lived in the castle for 800 years.\n\nEwan Frost-Pennington provides staff housing to help keep Muncaster Castle running\n\nThe UK Government insists it recognises the current service offered by bus operators is unsatisfactory for many passengers - particularly in rural areas and it will introduce a new law to address that. Officials say the forthcoming buses bill will allow councils in England to deliver better services as they could choose to take control of them. Under this franchising system, councils could be able to decide routes, timetables and fares - with operators bidding to run services for a fixed fee. In London and Greater Manchester, where this system is active, bus fares will remain capped at \u00a31.75 and \u00a32 respectively after the new England-wide cap rise - and some passengers told the BBC they felt this risked widening regional inequality. But experts warn this kind of system is not suitable for all communities and that it works best when a council area includes both urban and rural parts.\n\nCampaign for Better Transport Silviya Barrett says some councils may choose not to run bus services as they don't have the expertise\n\n\u201cThe benefit is that if you have both of these, the more profitable ones in urban areas can pay for the services in rural areas,\u201d says Silviya. She adds that another reason why some councils may choose not to operate a franchised bus system is that they no longer have the expertise. \u201dThey haven't managed buses to this extent since privatisation,\u201d she says. In 1986, services outside of London were deregulated and privatised. Before then most bus services were operated by publicly owned companies, which were often run by councils. Some experts say bus services would also be made better if the way they are funded was made simpler - as currently there are six separate pots councils can apply to for money. \u201cStreamlining bus funding into a single, long-term pot would give councils greater control over services and spending and residents more long-term certainty over future services,\" says Cllr Adam Hug, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association.\n\nA bus belonging to DRM who operate the service in Herefordshire used by Janette and Doreen\n\nGraham Vidler, from the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus operators, tells us: \"We accept that passengers face a mixed picture depending on where they live.\" He said better technology at bus stops was the responsibility of local councils but that many would struggle to find the money to upgrade them given their tight budgets and the fact there are so many. \"In contrast to the rail network, where there is a manageable number of stations, there are tens and tens of thousands of bus stops across the country.\" Louis Dyson, managing director of DRM Buses, which operates the route in Herefordshire that Janette and Doreen use, says the company had cut the route from hourly to two-hourly because of a drop in passenger numbers. \u201cIf as much funding was given to support rural services, rather than making city buses run every 15 minutes, then perhaps there would be more options for the public,\u201d he says. Dyson says that when buses were running late it was usually caused by bad traffic, roadworks, bad weather and a lack of bus lanes - factors outside of drivers\u2019 control. And in response to claims that passengers can\u2019t always view accurate information about when DRM\u2019s buses are arriving, he says vehicles have ticket machine tracking software but that the rural location of services interfered with their connectivity. Dyson says the service that Janette and Doreen regularly take would be changing to hourly \u201cin the next month or two\u201d if it gets approval from officials. For people like Janette and Doreen, that can\u2019t come soon enough. For them buses are what give them their independence and a chance to see family and friends. \u201cWe\u2019re only asking for the service we had before to be reinstated,\u201d says Janette. \u201cNothing more.\u201d",
    "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it \u201cAmerica First\u201d. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington\u2019s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\n\nNato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.\n\u2022 None What Chinese people want from the US The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

    "Badgers are mainly nocturnal animals and dig setts underground that can extend some distance\n\nBadgers tunnelling under a road in Lincolnshire have caused \u00a3100,000 worth of damage, a council has said. The mammals had dug a sett under the A52 at Seaholme Road, in the middle of Mablethorpe, according to Lincolnshire County Council. Emergency repairs to the road would have to be carried out to stop it falling apart, a spokesperson for the authority said. However, the council had had to wait for a licence from Natural England before the work could be carried out because badgers were a protected species, they added.\n\nThe authority had wanted to carry out the repairs earlier, but now the licence had been granted, it was running out of time to do the emergency work, according to the spokesperson. All work on badger setts must be completed between July and the end of November so the repairs did not interfere with the badgers' mating season, they explained.\n\nSeaholme Road joins the A52 which runs along the seafront at Mablethorpe\n\nCouncillor Richard Davies said: \u201cIn total, these works are going to cost us an additional \u00a3100,000 to complete.\u201d The Mablethorpe area already has road closures on the A1104 for resurfacing work, and Davies said the authority was aware of traffic flow issues in the town. The A1104 scheme could not be paused as it was at a critical point, he said. \u201cOur hands are tied about scheduling these conflicting works,\" Davies explained. \"We have no option but to get this additional programme up and running straight away. \"If there was any other option available to us, we\u2019d take it.\" Davies added that it was \"extremely frustrating we have not been given this licence until now\". The council spokesperson said the work would be carried out between 09:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT from Saturday 8 November and Wednesday 20 November. A three-way traffic light system would operate outside those hours so the road could be used. Natural England has been approached for a comment.

    "Primark owner Associated British Foods (ABF) has said the recent Budget may lead it to invest more outside the UK over fears the High Street will bear the \"weight of tax rises\". George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"We\u2019re an international business as well, we have choices about where we will invest.\" It comes as the owner of the fast fashion brand reported a 43% rise in profits before tax, reaching \u00a31.9bn over the year to 14 September. It said \"challenging weather\" had hit the number of people visiting its shops between April and June, but expects a strong performance over Christmas.\n\nFollowing its latest update to investors on Tuesday, the boss of ABF said it is preparing for a rise in costs after new measures were introduced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. During Labour's first Budget in 14 years, the chancellor set out changes including an increase in employers' national insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Weston said they would see ABF's wage bill \"go up by tens of millions\". \"It's quite clear to me that this a Budget where the weight of the tax rises are falling on business - within that, it's fallen particularly on the high street,\" he added. During an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Ms Reeves said that she was not \"immune\" to the criticism her plans have received. She suggested that the money raised would help put public finances on a \"firm footing\". The decision to increase NI contributions made by employers has come under fire from many businesses. Despite the prospect of rising costs, Mr Weston said in an interview with the PA News agency that there was \"no intention\" for Primark to raise its prices for the rest of year. Overall, Primark sales across the UK and Ireland grew by 0.7% in the year to 14 September, stripping out the effect of new shops opening. It said that sportswear, jumpers and pyjamas had done particularly well among its womenswear ranges.\n\nThe fashion giant said that it had seen a strong start to the sales of its autumn and winter ranges, despite wetter weather washing out those of summer shoes and beachwear. Primark saw a 6% growth in sales in the year overall and saw shirts and leisurewear items do well among men. It comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned of a \"disappointing\" October. The BRC suggested that shoppers were holding back on spending on bigger-ticket items until the \"Black Friday\" sales. Its latest figures suggest that total retail sales across the UK increased by 0.6% year-on-year in October, a drop against 2.6% seen in October 2023. \"This was part driven by half-term falling a week later this year, depressing the October figures, and November sales will likely see more of a boost,\" its chief executive Helen Dickinson OBE said. Ms Dickinson suggested that the Budget and rising energy bills might have \"spooked some consumers\" and blamed more mild weather recently for delaying winter purchases of items like coats and jackets. Elsewhere on Tuesday, online retail giant Asos reported mounting losses, reaching \u00a3393m in the year to 1 September. The group's turnaround plan has seen it reduce stock and launch clearance sales to shift old ranges. Chloe Collins, head of apparel at research firm GlobalData, suggested that the retailer has failed to \"combat the enormous threat\" from other companies include the likes of Shein, as well as the rise of second-hand clothing markets like Vinted. But Asos boss Jose Antonio Ramos Calamonte said there were some \"green shoots\" in the performance of its new clothes ranges in recent months. \"We will do things in the right way and we're going to be patient,\" he said.",
    "Seven new lawsuits filed against Sean 'Diddy' Combs\n\nSeven new civil lawsuits have been filed against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in a federal court in New York. Four men and three women accuse the hip-hop mogul of sexually assaulting them at various parties in Los Angeles, New York and Las Vegas. The youngest plaintiff was 13 at the time of the alleged incident. Mr Combs remains in custody at a Brooklyn jail. He is separately facing federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, which he denies. The BBC has approached his legal team for comment on the new cases.\n\nHis lawyers recently dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity\", stressing that \"Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d All seven of the new civil cases allege that Mr Combs - or by proxy through his associates - drugged alcoholic beverages at the events that made the plaintiffs dizzy, nauseous and feel outside their bodies. In several of the suits, plaintiffs allege that Mr Combs raped them, forced oral sex on them, or aggressively groped them. Mr Combs is currently awaiting trial in May of next year for the federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. The hip-hop icon has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has been denied bail multiple times. The indictment, along with several lawsuits, implicates his various business enterprises, alleging they played a role in facilitating and funding his abusive actions both inside and outside the music industry. The lawsuits further accuse Mr Combs of leveraging his power and influence in entertainment to manipulate, intimidate, and silence those around him.\n\nOne new case alleges Mr Combs and another male celebrity raped a 13-year-old girl at an after-party for the 2000 VMAs. The second male celebrity is not named in the lawsuit. Another alleges Mr Combs drugged an independent musical artist at a party and raped her. She says she woke up in pain and with imprints on her arms suggesting she had been tied with ropes while she was unconscious. In a third case, Mr Combs allegedly exposed himself to a man, and then grabbed the man's genitals in a \"rough\" and \"sexual\" manner. A fourth involves a celebrity personal trainer, who Mr Combs allegedly assaulted at a party at his Hollywood Hills home in 2022. The trainer says he saw many high-profile celebrities engaging in group sexual activities at the party, where he was later brought into a small room with Mr Combs, who removed the personal trainer's pants and performed \"non-consensual oral sex onto him\". The fifth new filing concerns a woman who alleges she was drugged at a party at Mr Combs' hotel room and woke up naked in bed with the rap musician talking on the phone in the corner of the room. The sixth case involves a man who ran a security firm. He alleges that he was invited into a private room by Mr Combs at a party, and he was then given a drink that made him feel dizzy and nauseous. He claims that Mr Combs then stuck his hands in his pants and grabbed his genitals. The seventh case, as reported by US media, was a 17-year-old aspiring musician who alleges he was assaulted at a party by Mr Combs. Mr Combs has faced almost a year of allegations, ranging from rape and sexual assault to grooming and domestic violence. One lawyer recently said more than 100 clients plan to sue the musician for sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. He is currently in jail while he awaits his trial in New York. Prosecutors alleged that he also engaged in kidnapping, forced labour, bribery and other crimes. They described him as the head of a criminal enterprise that abused women, using threats of violence to force them into participating in drug-fuelled orgies with male prostitutes. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was denied bail. His trial is due to take place in May 2025.",
    "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, external and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US. Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad. Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\" But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy. Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering. Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.\n\nMr Adani, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire, is a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n\nIndia\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share), seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market). With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide. His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa. Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.) \u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.\n\nAdani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday\n\nThis crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI. \u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC. For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects. \"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"\n\nMr Adani has faced challenges in Kenya over a planned takeover of an international airport\n\nThe latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal. \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC. What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes. Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.\n\nOpposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded the arrest of Mr Adani\n\nWhile the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong. \u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says. Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says. \"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d",

    "Disability Wales chief executive Rhian Davies has also added her concerns about the cut in the winter fuel payments\n\nMore pensioners will die because of the decision to withdraw the winter fuel payment, Wales' older people's commissioner has said. Rhian Bowen-Davies said UK ministers needed to reverse the decision that will see 90% of pensioners between 66 and 79 lose the payment. The Labour-run UK government said cuts were necessary to address what it called the financial \"black hole\" it inherited from the Conservatives. \"People will feel the impact of this,\" said Ms Bowen-Davies. \"We know that this could impact on 4,000 additional deaths this winter.\"\n\nShelia Burgess from Magor, Monmouthshire, began working at 15 and thought she would be able to claim her state pension at 60, but was then caught out by government changes to the rules. She is one of the so-called Waspi women who were born in the 1950s and say they didn't have enough time to prepare for the fact that they would have to work years longer before being able to claim their state pension.\n\nMs Burgess is now expecting to lose the winter fuel payment, external which had been \"something that made us not have to worry if the weather got very cold\". \"I appreciate it's not a huge amount of money but that \u00a3300 during the winter months is a big help,\" she said. The UK government's own figures showed 83% of people over 80 would lose the payment, rising to 90% of those aged 66 to 79. Other groups will lose out too, with 71% of pensioners with disabilities having the payment taken away.\n\nRhian Bowen-Davies, the older people\u2019s commissioner for Wales, is warning that more people will die as a result of the winter fuel payment cut\n\nDisability Wales chief executive Rhian Davies said some people needed every penny. \"They need to have warm homes [and] perhaps because of vision impairment they'll need to have good lighting. They need to be running equipment,\" she said. \"Many disabled people of whatever age often have higher fuel costs and need to have greater use of electricity, heating, directly related to their impairment.\"\n\nCaerfyrddin MP Ann Davies highlighted concerns about one of her constituent losing the winter fuel payment during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions\n\nThe plight of Welsh pensioners was raised by Plaid Cymru's Caerfyrddin MP, Ann Davies, during Prime Minister's Questions, external when she highlighted the case of constituent, Janette Crawford, whom she said suffered with ME and chronic pain. \"The cold, damp conditions of a Welsh winter are going to mean a lot more muscle soreness and fatigue for her,\" she said. \"She has lost her winter fuel payments due to having a very small savings pot. \"With 86% of pensioners in poverty, or just above that line, to miss out in Wales, will the prime minister establish a social energy tariff to help people like Janette?\" Sir Keir Starmer said his government had \"inherited a \u00a322bn black hole\" and Conservative MPs \"should be apologising... for leaving the country in such a state\". He said government was committed to the pension \"triple lock\" which would increase by \u00a3460 next year. \"That means pensioners under Labour will be better off because we are going to stabilise the economy after that lot lost control of it,\" he said.\n\nPension expert Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said people who have lost the payment had options such as applying for pension credit. \"You can look to see if you can qualify for the warm home discount, external, which is a rebate of \u00a3150 off your fuel bills\u2026 if you are genuinely really struggling with these energy bills this winter, speak to your supplier and see if they can help you,\" she said. She does not think Chancellor Rachel Reeves will change course during this month's Budget but \"one thing that could perhaps happen is to maybe soften it around the edges a bit\". She said that could include some kind of support for people who \"don't quite qualify for pension credit\".\n\nConservative social justice spokesman Joel James said Labour ministers \"must listen to the stark warning\" by the commissioner. \"Tens of thousands of people from Wales alone have signed petitions calling on Labour to reverse this nonsensical decision,\" he said. \"There is still time to change course before the winter and give pensioners the reprieve they deserve - before it's too late.\"",
    "The government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since Labour won the general election. It is the week where farmers are heading for Westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them. Among those expected outside Parliament on Tuesday is the country\u2019s most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, Jeremy Clarkson. Guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.\n\nNearly three weeks on from the Budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing. There is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected. BBC Verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers. But beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors. Indeed, speaking on The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and the president of the Countryside Alliance, said the government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax relief \u201csmell of incompetence\u201d and that a \"large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community\". Two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from Sir Keir Starmer down that they are not going to change their minds. And secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows Labour had with many in rural Britain the last time it was in power. Twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central London to highlight the needs of rural communities. The initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting. As farmers head for Westminster, the prime minister has been heading for South America - he is at the G20 Summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies in Brazil for the next few days. But the issue followed him into the skies of the south Atlantic, where he said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the \u201cvast majority of farms and farmers\u201d would not be affected by the changes. \u201cIt's important for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d he said. The truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the Budget. I asked Sir Keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.\n\nSir Keir Starmer says supporting farmers is \"very important\"\n\nAsked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, Sir Keir said \u201cit's very important that we support farmers.\u201d He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside. \"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming. \"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union. Incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in England as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas. It shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don\u2019t handle this well. So why has this row become so noisy so quickly? From the conversations I have had, I think there are three main reasons.\n\nFirstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it. The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21. Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed. For others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone. Secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by The Economist magazine: \u201cNever pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children\u2019s book.\u201d Trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes. Think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food. Thirdly, I am told it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context. \u201cIt is the straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back,\u201d is how one farming source put it to me. There was the new trade deal with Australia, which many farmers think undermines them. There are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after Brexit. And there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. There have been five farming ministers in the last five years. Put them all together and there is a disillusion and a widespread sense among farmers of not being listened to. Westminster is certain to hear them this week.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Cowboys, murderous revenge plots and family secrets have kept Yellowstone fans hooked since 2018. It is one of the most watched shows in the US and turned creator Taylor Sheridan into the king of prime time television. But last year, Paramount announced that the fifth season, which is due to end next month, would be the last. Its star, Kelly Reilly, tells me it will be \"an ending to the Yellowstone world we have known\". \"Does it mean it's the end of me playing her? Maybe, maybe not,\" she says. \"We don't know yet is the honest answer.\" There have already been two Yellowstone spin-offs, with more in the works. Reilly, who plays the troubled and volatile Beth Dutton, says she would \"love\" to keep playing her character, but any spin-off \"would be a new beginning somewhere\". It sounds like something is possibly in the works, though, with Reilly saying she \"can't talk about the future because there are so many conversations happening\".\n\nYellowstone's drama on screen has been mirrored off screen, with the departure of its leading man, Kevin Costner. He only filmed half of season five because of what he says were contract and scheduling issues, external. Sheridan has said, external it was down to Costner's wish to focus on his Horizon film series, which the star is directing, co-writing, producing and starring in. Either way, it leaves British-born Reilly as arguably the star of the show. The daughter of a police officer and a hospital receptionist, the actress was born and brought up in Chessington, Greater London. A far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nShe has previously starred in True Detective, Prime Suspect and Above Suspicion. But Yellowstone has introduced her to a huge international audience. I ask how it feels to be an in-demand leading lady. \"Well, I'm 47 years old, it hasn't happened overnight, you know. So it's not like I'm getting whiplash,\" she laughs. \"I have been a working actor for 30 years. It's not lost on me that there's a unicorn of shows that have such success worldwide and a character that has had this amount of attention or appeal. \"But I treat it at arm's length. I don't spend too much time thinking about it. I have a very normal life. It's very important to me that my life is normal. Nothing has changed, other than I'm really busy. \"I don't get to sleep at home very often, which is annoying because I love home!\"\n\nKelly Reilly with her on screen husband Cole Hauser\n\nMost fans assume Reilly is herself an American, not the softly spoken Brit she is in reality. She tells me that when Yellowstone started, she \"didn't do any press\" because she wanted people to believe in her character. \"People talk to me as if Beth is real,\" she says. \"We all talk about Beth like she's a real-life person. \"I'm always going to be a bit of a let down when people meet me. I go into the local bakery and the lady is like, 'I'd love to drink with you.' \"I know what she means - she wants to drink with Beth. People want to feel part of that energy... someone so connected with their primal self. \"And we're so disconnected. We're all on our phones, on social media. It is like it doesn't happen if someone doesn't take a picture of it. Beth is the opposite of that. She is just so alive.\" To say Reilly's character has been put through the wringer would be an understatement. Beth has survived attempted rape, attempted murder, crushing heartbreak and being betrayed by family members. She even exclaims: \"I am the rock therapists break themselves against.\" Reilly describes Beth as a \"powerhouse\", telling me it's been \"such a fun adventure to put her on\". \"I'm very introverted,\" she adds. \"I don't have any dreams of vengeance in my life. \"There\u2019s something really exciting about playing her. I feel like I\u2019m on an adrenaline rush for four months while I play her, and when I\u2019m finished I\u2019m like, I now have to go back to my quiet, boring life. And I'm very grateful for my quiet, boring life after I've played her. \"But by the time every summer comes around where I'm sort of gearing up again and the scripts start coming in, I get excited again to meet her. \"I'm very aware of the gift of her as a character, but I lock her up in a padlocked box for six months of the year.\"\n\nKelly Reilly on set on Yellowstone with Luke Grimes\n\nThe character of Beth quickly became a fan favourite, with articles devoted to getting her character's look, and thousands of social media posts about her. One of Beth's most memorable lines of dialogues, \"You are the trailer park, I am the tornado\", is even printed on T-shirts. What does Reilly put that popularity down to? \"She\u2019s unequivocally herself and unapologetic about that,\" she says. \"And as a woman, it is so refreshing and so much fun to play.\" The actress believes Beth \"has penetrated a zeitgeist in women specifically\". \"I think it is that unencumbered kind of freedom that she moves through the world with. She is not afraid of dying, she is not afraid of losing. \"There is a scene in season two where she is being attacked by a man who is in the process of raping her and is about to kill her and she is covered in blood. \"She will not be a victim to him. And I think for women and for me, I love that. She is fierce.\" After all the trauma her character has experienced, Reilly says she \"goes through different phases\" of considering what a happy ending would be for Beth. \"I trust Taylor and his vision for her. He loves her so much,\" she says. \"I would like something cathartic, potentially. I would hate to leave her out in the wilderness. But I don't know if happiness is something any of these characters strive for. \"They strive to protect, they strive to kill, they strive to be killed. These are not looking for peaceful lives.\" Yellowstone season five part two is on Paramount from Sunday, 10 November.",

    "There were more than 440,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March\n\nShoplifting is at \"unacceptable\" levels and not being tackled properly, a Lords inquiry has found. The crime is seriously under-reported and the problem is so urgent police forces need to take \"immediate action\", according to the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee. It says retailers need to be able to report crimes more easily, more funding is needed for offender rehabilitation, and regulations should be introduced to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods online anonymously. The Home Office said it was making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence and deploying \"thousands\" of police officers dedicated to tackling shoplifting.\n\nThe Lords committee held an inquiry into tackling shoplifting in which it heard evidence from police chiefs, retailers and industry experts in May and September. In a letter published today, it said there were more than 443,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March 2024 \u2013 the highest ever since records began 20 years ago. But they were \"a drop in the ocean\" when compared with likely real figures estimated at 17 million annually \u2013 which has \"devastating consequences for businesses and families\". Shop theft has evolved from \"individualised offending to relentless, large-scale, organised operations accompanied by unprecedented levels of violence\", it added. Tracey Robertson, co-owner of Paw Prints \u2013 a small chain of pet shops across Yorkshire \u2013 says shoplifting costs her business around \u00a38,000 a year. \"It\u2019s a financial impact on a family business. It\u2019s bad in the fact that it affects the staff that work for us because sometimes it\u2019s aggressive and violent,\" she said.\n\nTracey Robertson, who owns a small chain of pet shops in Yorkshire, says shoplifting costs her around \u00a38,000 a year\n\nThe committee supported schemes like Project Pegasus - a partnership between retailers and police to tackle organised shoplifting gangs - but said there needs to be a strategy to deal with local prolific offenders too. \"The scale of the shop theft problem within England and Wales is totally unacceptable and action, like that under way in the Pegasus scheme, is vital and urgent,\" said Lord Foster of Bath, chair of the committee. The committee found there is a widespread perception that shop theft is not treated seriously by the police which \"risks undermining confidence in the police and wider criminal justice system\". It said shoplifting cost the retail sector nearly \u00a32bn last year \u2013 which resulted in price rises impacting individuals, families and communities. \"We acknowledge the pressures on police resources, but we believe that the urgency of the situation relating to shop theft requires immediate action within existing police staffing levels,\" the letter said. It has made a series of recommendations to the government which it says would \"help tackle the problem and keep the public and our economy safer\".\n\u2022 None Phasing out the use of the outdated term \"shoplifting\" which serves to trivialise the severity of the offence\n\u2022 None Developing improved reporting systems to enable retailers to report crime to the police quickly and easily\n\u2022 None Introducing regulations to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods on online marketplaces anonymously\n\u2022 None Introducing regulations and best practice guidance for the use of facial recognition technology by private companies Shop owner Tracey Robertson believes the recommendations do not go far enough and wants to see much tougher sentences for repeat offenders. Professor of criminology Emmeline Taylor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said the committee recommendations are \"far-reaching\" and understand the multiple root causes of shop theft. \"If adopted by the police, the industry and the government it will certainly do a huge amount to begin to turn the tide on the tsunami of shop theft that has impacted the retail sector across the UK.\"\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said it welcomed the report which further highlights the significant impact retail crime has on its victims. \"We are doing all we can to reduce thefts and pursue offenders, especially those prolific and habitual offenders, who cause misery within the community,\" said Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman, the NPCC\u2019s lead for acquisitive crime. The Home Office said it understands the \"devastating impact\" of shop theft has on communities. A spokesperson added: \"We are taking immediate action through our commitment to scrap the \u00a3200 shop theft threshold, and making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence. \"We will also put thousands more dedicated police officers on our streets, and establish a Retail Crime Forum for retailers to confidently implement tactics against shop theft.\"",
    "Trump ally says Ukraine focus must be peace, not territory\n\nTrump has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources\n\nA former adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in Ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by Russia. Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a \"realistic vision for peace\". \"And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious,\" he said. \"Crimea is gone.\" A spokesperson for Trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza \"does not speak for him\".\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's east. The president-elect has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on US resources, in the form of military aid to Ukraine. But he has yet to divulge how he intends to do so - and will likely be hearing competing visions for Ukraine's future from his various advisers. Mr Lanza, a Trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern Ukraine, but he said regaining Crimea from Russia was unrealistic and \"not the goal of the United States\". \"When Zelensky says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once Crimea is returned, we've got news for President Zelensky: Crimea is gone,\" he told the BBC World Service\u2019s Weekend programme. \"And if that is your priority of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you're on your own.\" The US has never deployed American soldiers to fight in Ukraine, nor has Kyiv requested American troops fight on its behalf. Ukraine has only requested American military aid to arm its own soldiers. Mr Lanza said he had tremendous respect for the Ukrainian people, whose \"hearts are made of lions\". But he said the US priority was \"peace and to stop the killing\". \"What we're going to say to Ukraine is, you know what you see? What do you see as a realistic vision for peace. It's not a vision for winning, but it's a vision for peace. And let's start having the honest conversation,\" he said. In response, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn characterised Mr Lanza's remarks as placing the pressure for peace on Ukraine when it was \"Putin who wants more war\". \"Putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front. What does this indicate? It is obvious that he wants to fight on,\" he said. \"Ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals. And it is Russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of Russian strikes.\" A spokesperson for Trump's transition team - which prepares the incoming administration for office - said Mr Lanza was \"a contractor for the campaign\", but \"does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him\". Trump is expected to handle peace talks with a close circle of aides once in office. An unnamed National Security Council aide who previously served under Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday: \"Anyone - no matter how senior in Trump\u2019s circle - who claims to have a different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn\u2019t know what he or she is talking about.\" They said that the former president \"makes his own calls on national security issues\" and had done so \"many times in the moment\". Trump spoke to Zelensky after his election win, with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part in the call.\n\nZelensky and Trump after a meeting in the US earlier this year - they spoke on the phone on Wednesday\n\nA source in Ukraine's presidential office told the BBC that the \"good lengthy conversation\" between Zelensky and Trump lasted \"about half an hour\". \u201cIt was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things, but overall it was very warm and pleasant.\u201d Trump's Democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for Ukraine that will endanger all of Europe. The prime minister of Estonia told the BBC that if Ukraine backs down from the conflict, \"Russia\u2019s appetite will only grow\". Kristen Michal told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"The question probably is that if you start giving up, then you should be prepared to give more. \"For Russia it\u2019s quite understandable that if you draw a line somewhere and use the force to back it up, they will back up too, but not by politeness, that\u2019s not the plan.\"\n\nLast month, Zelensky presented a \"victory plan\" to the Ukrainian parliament that included a refusal to cede Ukraine\u2019s territories and sovereignty. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d, but never gave further details. A paper written by two of his former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue supplying weapons, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, the paper said, but it should negotiate based on current front lines. Earlier this week, Putin congratulated Trump on his election victory and said Trump's claim that he can help end the war in Ukraine \"deserves attention at least\". Mr Lanza also criticised the support the Biden-Harris administration and European countries have given to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"The reality on the ground is [that] the European nation states and President Biden did not give Ukraine the ability and the arms to win this war at the very beginning and failed to lift the restrictions for Ukraine to win,\" he said. Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives approved a $61bn (\u00a349bn) package in military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion. The US has been the biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - between February 2022 and the end of June 2024, it delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $55.5bn (\u00a341.5bn), according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation. Clarification: This article has been amended to reflect that Bryan Lanza stopped working as an adviser to the Trump campaign after the election.",
    "Ben Earl scored his first try of England's Autumn Nation Series campaign\n\nEngland ended their five-match losing run with a nine-try hammering of Eddie Jones' Japan at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium. The victory marked a first and only win of a difficult Autumn Nation Series campaign for Steve Borthwick's side after close defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Captain Jamie George scored twice in a clinical opening period, which saw Ben Earl, Sam Underhill and Ollie Sleightholme also grab tries. The Brave Blossoms managed one eye-catching score in the first half through captain Naoto Saito. Full-back George Furbank gathered Tommy Freeman's sublime behind-the-back pass to score England's sixth try in the second half, before replacement hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie burrowed over the line for the first of his two tries. Flanker Kazuki Himeno's try gave Jones' side a deserved second-half score, but the hosts finished the strongest with Tom Roebuck adding to Cowan-Dickie's score for his first international try. It was Borthwick's side's first win since June when they comfortably beat Japan 52-17 in Tokyo. Former England head coach Jones, who was sacked by the Rugby Football Union in 2022 and later replaced by Borthwick, kept a low profile in the build-up to his return, having been in charge during England's joint-worst run since 2018 of five straight defeats. His successor ends the year with five wins from 12 games as Borthwick continues to navigate a tough transition period following a third-placed finish at last year's Rugby World Cup. At least one statement scalp would have been expected after signs of progress in this year's Six Nations and during the summer Tests against New Zealand, meaning a sole win over Japan to end a dreadful run will instead go down as an autumn to forget.\n\nDespite three intense fixtures on the bounce, Borthwick opted against wholesale changes as he offered his regulars a chance to finish the autumn on a high. The final quarter of matches has proved to be England's sticking point in recent games, with late leads blown against New Zealand and Australia. What has remained a strength is their ability to start fast and that continued when Marcus Smith sent Ollie Lawrence through a hole and the Bath centre found Earl who ran under the posts for the opening score. Flanker Underhill then showed his power for the second week in a row close to the try-line to extend the lead, before captain George dotted down twice from rampaging mauls. That ability to close out a tight Test match was never likely to be challenged by the Brave Blossoms, who despite improvement under Jones, were heavily defeated by New Zealand and France this autumn. However, Japan's high-paced attacking style finally clicked as Saito got on the end of Dylan Riley's break after some slick handling from inside their own half. But the hosts were able to respond through an equally impressive flowing move when Will Stuart's initial break led to Sleightholme's sharp finish in the corner, as the Northampton Saints wing showed his instinctive finishing ability by regathering his own grubber kick for a fourth autumn try.\n\nTommy Freeman set up George Furbank's try with a sublime behind-the-back pass\n\nAn outrageous piece of skill from Freeman, who flung the ball behind his back to set up club team-mate Furbank, then raised the volume in an Allianz Stadium. In their games against the All Blacks and world champions South Africa, England had failed to score after the 60th minute. Following Himeno's try, any concern over whether they could finish strongly was quickly answered by Cowan-Dickie's second try from close range. Replacement Roebuck, who impressed off the bench, showed his lethal finishing skills from Fin Smith's crossfield kick, fending off one defender before a sharp step sent him over. For England, a full house of victories over rugby's big three southern hemisphere sides was always a big ask. Small margins prevented them from picking up at least one other victory than this, but ending their miserable run was at least a step forward for Borthwick after a challenging month.",
    "Pubs face widespread closures unless the chancellor announces an extension to business rates relief in next week's Budget, the UK's biggest pub company has warned. David McDowall, boss of Stonegate Group, whose pubs include Slug & Lettuce, Yates's and Walkabout, said thousands of landlords currently make just 12p of profit for every pint of beer they sell. Help on business rates for the hospitality sector in England and Wales is set to run out in April. Mr McDowall said that if it is removed, small publicans will see their business rates bill quadruple from April.\n\nAlong with other costs the businesses are facing, he feared \"they don\u2019t have any more to give\". Rates relief was introduced for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes in 2020 in response to the Covid pandemic when businesses were forced to close. In the Budget in November last year, the then Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced it had been extended until April next year. The measure means that companies in England can claim 75% relief on business rates up to \u00a3110,000, or 40% for firms in Wales. Mr McDowall told the BBC's Today programme that the hospitality industry has faced a \"barrage\" of challenges in recent years. These include recovering from Covid as well as high inflation, energy costs in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the effect of the cost of living on customers. \"The complete removal of that rate relief would prove very, very costly for pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes up and down the length and breath of the UK\", he said. The British Beer and Pub Association recently revealed that landlords make 12p profit per pint. The average price of a pint of draught lager was \u00a34.79 in September, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile, a freeze on alcohol duty is scheduled to end on 1 February next year. Mr McDowall is one of a number of representatives from the hospitality industry who this week signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves asking for relief to be extended. It warned about \"the onrushing business rates cliff edge\" facing firms 153 days after she delivers the Budget.\n\nOn Thursday, UKHospitality and the British Retail Consortium, whose members also benefit from relief, said that in the year to March, businesses in these sectors paid nearly \u00a39bn in business rates. This is nearly a third of the total amount of revenue the government raises from business rates. They said that if relief is removed, it would cost hospitality and retail an additional \u00a32.5bn. Earlier this week, UKHospitality also called on the chancellor to stick to Labour's manifesto pledge to reform business rates. The amount businesses pay is based on how much annual rent could be charged on the premises - which is known as the rateable value. UKHospitality argued that, because its businesses can usually be found in central locations such as High Streets, the cost to companies is high. Without reform \"investment in our high streets will be curtailed, employment opportunities will be squandered and ultimately, we will see higher levels of business failure,\" it said. A spokesperson for the Treasury, said: \u201cWe\u2019re supporting businesses like our well-loved pubs through pledges to make the business rates system fairer, cap corporation tax at 25% and to publish a corporate tax roadmap so that they have some welcome certainty to plan for the future.\u201d\n\nWhat do you want to see in the Budget, how do you think it will affect you personally and what would you like us to explain?",
    "Comedian Godley to go on 'final tour' before funeral\n\nGodley died on 2 November while receiving palliative care for terminal cancer\n\nThe funeral of comedian Janey Godley will take place over two days across two cities as part of a \u201cfinal tour\u201d of Scotland. A hearse will travel through Edinburgh on 29 November in tribute to her \u201cbeloved festival home\u201d before returning to Glasgow on 30 November for the ceremony. The funeral for the comic, who died on 2 November aged 63 after receiving palliative care for terminal cancer, will take place at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral in the city\u2019s west end. Her daughter, Ashley Storrie, confirmed the arrangements on social media.\n\nGodley, who found viral fame with her dubbed parodies of then Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon's coronavirus news briefings during the pandemic, revealed she had ovarian cancer in November 2021. She had been due to embark on a tour entitled \u201cNot Dead Yet,\u201d but was forced to cancel it after her condition worsened. Godley was given the all-clear in 2022 but later that year announced another scan had shown signs of the disease in her abdomen. In the social media post her daughter said: \"Here's the details of Janey's final tour, thank you for all the love and kindness in this past week. \"For the past few years of Ma's life, it was important to her that she shared her journey with everyone, to offer support for others on the same path and to highlight the symptoms of Ovarian Cancer - all of course in her very singular Janey style, with laughter and candour. \"So many of you who have travelled with us on this journey wish to bid her a final farewell, so here's the details of my mum's final tour, in the two cities she loved with all her heart.\"\n\nThe hearse will travel along the Royal Mile and Lawnmarket in Edinburgh with a \"pause for reflection\" at St Giles' Cathedral before travelling along Cockburn Street, Market Street and on to Glasgow. After the funeral on Saturday there will be a private service at a crematorium. Ms Storrie said her mother asked that instead of traditional funeral attire, those who wish to do so should wear bright colours to celebrate her life. She also asked that no flowers be sent but said people were invited to contribute to the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice or any charity of their choice. Godley won the inaugural Sir Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow Award at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival. She died peacefully in the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow, surrounded by her loved ones, her management company said last weekend.",

Aftermath of deadly Israeli strike on press building in Lebanon\n\nThree Lebanese journalists have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a building known to be housing reporters in south-eastern Lebanon, witnesses have told the BBC. The attack was carried out on a guesthouse in a compound in Hasbaya being used by more than a dozen journalists from at least seven media organisations - with a courtyard containing cars clearly marked with \"press\". The men worked for broadcasters Al-Manar TV and Al Mayadeen TV, which issued statements paying tribute to their killed employees. Lebanon's information minister said the attack was deliberate and described it as a \"war crime\". The Israeli military says it targeted a Hezbollah structure, but is reviewing the incident.\n\nThose killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda from pro-Iranian news channel Al Mayadeen, as well as camera operator Wissam Qassem from the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar. The Lebanese ministry of health said three others were injured in the blast. Five reporters had been killed in prior Israeli strikes in Lebanon, including Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah. Footage broadcast by Al-Jadeed TV - whose journalists were also sharing the house - showed a bombed-out building with a collapsed roof and floors covered in rubble. A vehicle used for TV broadcasts was overturned on its side, its satellite dish mangled with cabling nearby. \"All official parties were told that this house was being used as a stay-house for journalists. We coordinated with them all,\" an Al-Jadeed journalist, caked in concrete dust, said in a live broadcast while panting and coughing. Lebanese journalists covering the conflict in the south of the country had to relocate from nearby Marj'youn to Hasbaya, as the former became too dangerous. In a statement hours after the incident, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had struck a Hezbollah military structure in Hasbaya from where \u201cterrorists were operating\u201d. The incident showed that proximity to \"terrorist infrastructure poses a danger\u201d, the force said. It added: \u201cSeveral hours after the strike, reports were received that journalists had been hit during the strike. The incident is under review.\u201d\n\nYoumna Fawwaz, a reporter for broadcaster MTV Lebanon, told the BBC that journalists in the compound were awoken at around 03:00 local time (01:00 BST) by the strike. She said ceilings had fallen in on them, and they were surrounded by rubble and dust, with the sound of fighter jets overhead. Each news organisation had their own building in the compound, she said, and the building housing the Al Mayadeen reporters was \"obliterated\" while Al-Manar employees were inside. Ms Fawwaz said it was a media compound known as such to both Israel and Hezbollah. \"The airstrike was carried out on purpose. Everyone knew we were there. All the cars were labelled as press and TV. There wasn't even a warning given to us.\" She added: \"They are trying to terrorise us just like they do in Gaza. Israelis are trying to prevent us from covering the story.\" Lebanon's information minister accused Israel of intentionally targeting journalists, in contravention of international law. \"The Israeli enemy waited for the journalists' nighttime break to betray them in their sleep,\" Ziad Makary wrote in a post on X. \"This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with prior planning and design, as there were 18 journalists there representing seven media institutions.\"\n\nHasbaya, about five miles (eight kilometres) from the Israeli border, is inhabited by Muslims, Christians, as well as people from the Druze ethnic and religious minority. It has seen attacks on its peripheries in recent weeks, but this was the first strike on the settlement itself. The attack comes as part of an expanding conflict in Lebanon, where Israel has been intensifying air strikes for weeks - as well as launching a ground invasion on border towns and villages in the south. On Friday UN peacekeepers said they were forced to withdraw from an observation post in Zahajra, in the south-west, after it was fired on by Israeli forces earlier this week. Unifil has accused Israel of targeting its bases several times in recent weeks, causing injuries to peacekeepers. Israel denies this and has blamed previous incidents on clashes with nearby Hezbollah fighters. In the northern Bekaa area, the Israeli military has confirmed it attacked the Jousieh border crossing between Syria and Lebanon overnight - which it said was being used by Hezbollah and Syrian security forces to smuggle weapons. Lebanese authorities have recorded over 1,700 air strikes across the country in the past three weeks. Hostilities broke out between Israel and Hezbollah on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people. The Iran-backed armed group has since been firing rockets and drones into Israel in what it described as \"solidarity\" with Palestinians in Gaza. Nearly 2,600 people in Lebanon have been killed in the current conflict, according to the country's health ministry - many of the deaths occurring since Israel began escalating its attacks on 23 September. Around 60,000 people in northern Israel have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire, and the Israeli government has declared returning them to their homes to be a key objective. Two people were killed on Friday in a Hezbollah rocket attack on Majd al-Krum, a town near Karmiel in Israel's north, according to a statement, external from the country's foreign ministry. In southern Lebanon, satellite imagery examined by the BBC shows Israel's intensified bombing campaign has caused more damage to buildings in two weeks than occurred during a year of cross-border fighting. Data shows that more than 3,600 buildings in Lebanon appear to have been damaged or destroyed between 2 and 14 October - about 54% of the total damage. The attack on journalists in Lebanon comes days after the Israeli military accused six Al Jazeera journalists working in northern Gaza of being affiliated with Hamas or other armed Palestinian groups. The Qatari broadcaster said it denies and \"vehemently condemns\" the allegations. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 123 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a war in the territory last year. Gaza's Hamas-run health authority has reported more than 42,000 people killed since. Two Israeli journalists have also been killed in the conflict.",
    "Lucy Letby discussed the death of a baby in a \"gossipy way\", the inquiry has heard\n\nLucy Letby emailed her colleagues at the Countess of Chester Hospital claiming she had been \"exonerated\" and asking them to be \"sensitive and supportive\". The Thirlwall Inquiry into Letby's crimes heard the former nurse wrote the email in January 2017, six months after she had been removed from frontline clinical duties. She claimed that \"a thorough investigation\" had established that \"all allegations were unfounded and untrue\u201d and that she had \"received a full apology\" from the hospital trust. Letby had been moved into an administrative role after a group of consultant paediatricians persistently raised concerns about the deaths and collapses of babies on the neonatal ward.\n\nSix months later the consultants were told to apologise to Letby after two independent reviews reported there was no evidence of deliberate harm. A grievance procedure against her removal from the ward had also been upheld. The email said: \"As you can imagine this whole episode has been distressing for me and my family. \"I will begin my return to the unit in the coming weeks. I will need colleagues to be sensitive and supportive at this time.\" Letby never returned to the unit, which the inquiry previously heard was down to the \"persistence\" of consultants who suspected her of being a murderer. The inquiry also heard from a nurse who recalled Letby telling her about the death of a child in an \"excited\" and \"gossipy\" way. Melanie Taylor said she could not remember which baby's death Letby was referring to, but recalled how she spoke about it. She said: \"It was almost in a way that she was excited to tell me, almost in a gossipy manner.\" The inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall is examining how the killer nurse was able to murder and attack babies at the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2015 and 2016.\n\nLady Justice Thirlwall is chairing the inquiry, which is being held at Liverpool Town Hall\n\nRachel Langdale KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Ms Taylor if the way Letby spoke about the baby's death struck her as unusual or disrespectful. Ms Taylor said: \"Yes, it did. There were parts of [Letby's] personality that were a little strange to me, so I took that as a personality difference between me and her.\" The inquiry also heard about text messages Letby had written about the death of a baby who was later found to be one of her victims. Ms Taylor said the message showed a \"lack of compassion\". In the messages, Letby said she wanted to get back to the nursery where the boy died to get over the death. Her colleague replied Letby needed to \"let it go or it'll eat you up\". Letby said: \"I need to go back and have a sick baby [to take care of], otherwise the image of the one you've lost never leaves you.\"\n\nMs Taylor told the inquiry she had never heard of going back to the unit where a death occurred as a way of dealing with or getting over trauma. When asked what she thought about Letby wanting to go back to the nursery where the baby had died, Ms Taylor said it was \"highly inappropriate\", adding: \"The text messages I've seen show a lack of compassion.\" Ms Taylor told the inquiry she did not have any suspicions at the time that Letby could be harming babies. \"That's an unthinkable thing in a way. \"Nursing is a profession where you put your trust in each other, and I mean this is not an event that happens in anybody's lifetime.\" Another nurse told the inquiry Letby had shouted at her for suggesting she should take a break from working on the intensive care unit after a baby died. Nurse Kathryn Percival Calderbank said she had made the suggestion for Letby to spend time on the special care unit - where babies were not as poorly - so she could do nice things like feed and cuddle babies. \"She was really angry with me. She felt it was boring looking after special care babies,\" she said. Letby, 34, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after being convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. The inquiry is expected to sit until early next year, with findings published by late autumn 2025.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Man who got on 'wrong plane' arrested\n\nEasyJet said a passenger had \"incorrectly\" boarded the plane\n\nA flight was delayed at Manchester Airport after a man \"incorrectly\" boarded the plane, EasyJet has said. The BBC understands an airport passenger had been due to fly on another EasyJet flight but gained entry to the Milan-bound flight on Friday evening in error. All passengers had to disembark the plane as extra security checks were carried out in line with standard procedure. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said a man had \"embarked on a flight without the correct documentation\".\n\nNothing suspicious was found on board and there was no suggestion that it was terror-related. An EasyJet spokesman said that the flight was \"subject to additional security checks, in line with procedures, due to a passenger incorrectly boarding the flight\". \"Safety and security is our highest priority and so we will now work with our ground partner at Manchester Airport to understand how he was able to board the flight.\" On Saturday, a GMP spokesman said a man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of hiding himself with the purpose of \"being carried in an aircraft without consent and intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\". An EasyJet spokesman said the company was \"not able to provide further details while [the investigation] is ongoing\".",

    "Stokes doubtful for first Test against Pakistan\n\nBen Stokes has not played for England since the end of July\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes is a doubt for the first Test against Pakistan in Multan as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury. Stokes, 33, has been out since the beginning of August, missing the 2-1 series victory over Sri Lanka. England trained in Multan for the first time on Friday. All-rounder Stokes batted in the nets and bowled a handful of deliveries off a few paces. He indicated last week he is unlikely to bowl at the beginning of this three-match series, which gets under way on Monday. Opener Zak Crawley told BBC Sport: \"He seems to be going well, recovering well from his injury. \"We don't know just yet. I think he's got to do a few more tests, but he's been doing some running and stuff.\" If Stokes is fit to play, but not bowl, England will have a decision on how to balance their side. Against Sri Lanka they played five specialist bowlers, which would mean leaving out one of their regular top order.\n\nTo avoid dropping a batter, or even leaving out wicketkeeper Jamie Smith and handing the gloves to Ollie Pope, England could play four specialist bowlers and lean on Joe Root's off-spin. Curiously, balancing the side might be easier if Stokes is ruled out completely. Pope would continue to deputise as skipper, Smith could remain at six, leaving space for the five bowlers, which seems particularly necessary in temperatures of around 36 degrees. Crawley said the Multan pitch currently has a \"green tinge\", so England may feel the need for three seamers and two spinners. With pace bowler Olly Stone set to leave the tour for his wedding and Josh Hull ruled out of the tour with a quad injury, Brydon Carse could be in line for a Test debut, possibly vying for a place in the side with Durham team-mate Matthew Potts. \"We've got a really deep squad, with plenty of options with the ball and with the bat as well,\" added Crawley. \"We've got bowlers who can bat really well, as proven in the summer. We feel ready. Whatever team comes out, it will be a nice balance either way.\" Crawley is also returning from an injury after spending more than two months out with a broken finger. The 26-year-old damaged the little finger on his right hand attempting a slip catch as England wrapped up a 3-0 series win over West Indies at Edgbaston in July. He was unable to hold a bat for five weeks, then returned to training just over two weeks ago. Though Crawley believes he is fit to return to his usual fielding position of second slip, he has been given medical advice to refrain from doing so yet. \"I feel brand new,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to getting out there. I've certainly missed it, so I can't wait to get out there again with the boys. \"I've come back with a new hunger. I feel like I've got a lot of energy. No one wants any time out and I wouldn't choose to do it again, but I've taken some positives from it for sure.\" Test Match Special will have live ball-by-ball commentary of England's tour of Pakistan on BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Cardiff woman quits drinking over fear she would die by Christmas\n\nAfter an 18-hour bender that finished at 9am, the \"beer fear and anxiety\" got too much, and Jessie Hallett knew she had to quit drinking. For more than a decade, weeks would go by without a day of sobriety - but now the 29-year-old realised she had a problem, and may not make it to Christmas if she didn't stop. New figures from DrinkAware, external - a charity that works with the alcohol industry - show that 89% of drinkers in Wales are using at least one technique to moderate their drinking. The statistics show a rise in 18 to 34 year olds who never binge drink, with more in the Generation Z age group turning to \"intermittent sobriety\" where they want to give up drinking at least for periods of time.\n\n\"I was burning the candles at both ends, I was working long days and instead of going home after those shifts I would go out after it,\" said Jessie. \"I would drink the next day to avoid the hangover. \"Then all of a sudden weeks go by and you realise you haven't had a day go by without a drink.\" Jessie, who lives in Cardiff, said she drank socially from a young age - but it's when she started working in hospitality she noticed her drinking habits changing, going out after shifts finished. Then the pandemic hit, which made her drinking much worse. \"I was severely depressed at the time, my mental health was in the bin,\" she added. \"I was having panic attacks and anxiety and the only way to mask that was through drugs and alcohol.\"\n\nJessie uses her social media to raise awareness about sobriety\n\nThings came to a head on Beaujolais Day 2022 - a French event that toasts the wine harvest every November, that has become popular in Wales. Jessie said: \"I'd gone on an 18-hour bender. I got home at nine in the morning after being out all day. \"The beer fear and anxiety was too much. \"After that moment, I knew. If I hadn't given up drinking, I wouldn't have made it to Christmas.\" The next day she told friends and family, and their reaction made her realise she had made the right decision. \"Not one person who was close to me questioned it,\" said Jessie. \"That to me was alarm bells, everyone knew that was something I had to do.\"\n\nSince going sober, Jessie goes to the gym five or six times a week and has lost five stone in weight\n\nAfter almost two years of being sober, her whole life has changed. \"I could never have imagined the life I'm living now. I was really unhealthy when I was drinking,\" she said. \"I've lost five stone [31.75kg], I go to the gym five or six times a week, I have a new passion for fitness. I get up at 5am every day. \"My career has absolutely taken off, I haven't even had a cold since being sober.\" Jessie runs a social media company and says it's quite \"ironic\", because 90% of her clients are involved with alcohol. \"It empowers me that I can be around booze and the industry and say you don't have the power over me anymore,\" she said.\n\nNon-alcoholic events are becoming popular in the UK, especially with students. Intermittent sobriety is the new buzz term among Gen Zs who want to give up drinking, but not completely. Chris Evans, 23, from Aberaeron, Ceredigion, has teamed up with business development service FOR Cardiff, external to launch the My Drink, My Choice campaign. It aims to promote alternatives to evening activities centred around drinking, while normalising the decision to avoid alcohol. \"I come from a small town, and coming to Cardiff it is easy to get into a culture of drinking alcohol,\" Chris said. \"I didn't even drink much until coming to university, it's easy to get swept up in it all.\"\n\nAlthough Chris still drinks he is aware of why people make the choice not to. \"International students who can't or choose not to drink alcohol didn't even cross my mind,\" he said. \"Events like this gives a chance to give somewhere safe for people to socialise and to be confident to be yourself.\"\n\nGP Dr Will Mackintosh, who is based in St Clears, Carmarthenshire, believes younger people have better insight into how alcohol and binge drinking can affect them. \"Traditionally, older people, when they think of alcohol abuse, they think of liver disease,\" he said. \"But younger people are more aware of the different harms alcohol can have on you.\" He added that while other generations think of alcohol issues as liver disease, which you get much later in life, younger people see the fuller picture of all the associated dangers - such as taking risks and acting impulsively.\n\nJessie said social media is a great way to hold herself accountable\n\nJessie's best advice for anyone wanting to go sober would be to \"de-clutter your social media\". \"Fill your feed up with people who inspire you. I still to this day, nearly two years on, take one day at a time,\" she said. \"That's why I still count how many days sober I am, because I don't know what's going to happen when I wake up tomorrow. \"But I do know I am going to wake up hangover-free.\"\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

London Zoo has asked for any sightings to be reported to them, adding the two blue and yellow-feathered birds were likely to stick together.\n\nThe macaws are \"ambassadors to their species\", London Zoo has said\n\nThis species of parrot was believed to be extinct until some were recognised in the Bolivian savannah in 1992.

    "A British businessman caught on camera confessing he was illegally selling luxury perfume to Russia is not facing criminal charges, the BBC has learned. David Crisp admitted to an undercover investigator that he had \u201cignored government edicts\u201d on sanctions by selling the \u00a31,000-a-bottle perfume in Russia. The BBC can now exclusively show the undercover video, which has previously only been shared in court. Mr Crisp was arrested in 2023 by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) - the UK government agency responsible for sanctions enforcement - but the investigation was dropped earlier this year. This is despite the discovery of evidence that he tried to conceal more than \u00a31.7m of illegal sales. Mr Crisp, from Surrey, denies knowingly breaching sanctions or concealing trades with Russia. There has not been a single UK criminal conviction for violating trade sanctions on Russia, the BBC understands, since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago. Failing to punish violators is \u201ca bad signal to send\u201d and makes the UK look like a \u201csoft touch,\u201d says senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who has been calling for tougher action against Russia.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Undercover filming: David Crisp tells a private investigator how he sells perfume to Russia\n\nMr Crisp travelled the world selling high-end perfume, regularly rubbing shoulders with celebrities and VIPs, who were unaware of his activities in Russia. But when he started chatting to a friendly American in the lift of a luxury hotel in Dallas in July last year, he had no idea he was actually speaking to a private investigator. Posing as a Las Vegas businessman, the agent said he was interested in stocking Mr Crisp\u2019s perfumes. They later met in Crisp\u2019s hotel room to smell the fragrances - where the investigator secretly filmed the conversation. \u201cHow\u2019s your Russian market?\u201d the investigator asked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Mr Crisp replied, \u201cWe\u2019re doing really well\u2026 we ignore government edicts.\u201d After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the UK government introduced sanctions banning trade with Russia in several areas - perfumes are specifically named. Breaching these regulations is a serious offence, with a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years. Following the introduction of sanctions, Mr Crisp had agreed with his then-business partner, David Garofalo, to cease trading with Russia. But Mr Garofalo later became suspicious after a whistleblower claimed that Crisp continued to sell perfume in Moscow. Mr Garofalo then hired the private investigators. The undercover footage is \u201csickening\u201d David Garofalo told me as we watch the footage together, adding \u201che knows that he\u2019s violating the sanctions\u201d.\n\nDavid Garofalo halted all sales to Russia once he took full control of the company\n\nWithout Mr Crisp\u2019s knowledge, the company also compiled a dossier of evidence that he had knowingly violated sanctions. Staff also found pallets of goods in the company\u2019s UK facility with paperwork showing recipients in Russia, and international shipping data confirming deliveries. Products were discovered on sale in Moscow that the company had only launched after the imposition of sanctions. \u201cHe had actually gone out of his way to disguise the fact that he\u2019d continued selling to Russia,\u201d Mr Garofalo told us. \u201cHe had deceived our in-house lawyer and misled our auditors.\u201d Mr Garofalo reported Mr Crisp to HMRC and it opened a criminal investigation. At the same time, Mr Garofalo pursued a civil case against his partner to remove him from the company. In July this year, a High Court judge granted a rare provisional injunction, meaning Mr Crisp would be removed immediately pending the full civil trial. In his ruling, the judge said the undercover video was \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that Mr Crisp knew he was breaching sanctions and the company accounts showed he \u201cconcealed the Russian trading\u201d. After taking full control of the company, Mr Garofalo immediately halted all sales to Russia. In a statement, David Crisp told the BBC: \u201cI strongly refute the allegations made against me by Mr Garofalo, at no point did I knowingly trade in breach of Russian sanctions\u2026 at no point did I attempt to conceal those trades\u2026 the companies' trades with Russia were well known to those within the business\u2026 I look forward to being fully exonerated.\u201d\n\nHMRC officers arrested Mr Crisp upon arrival at Gatwick Airport in October 2023 and seized his passport. But, by July this year, HMRC had dropped its investigation and told Mr Crisp that it would take no further action against him, returning his passport. Mr Garofalo told us he was shocked HMRC had showed no interest in the evidence he had collected. \u201cIt was an open and shut case. The evidence was just irrefutable.\u201d HMRC does not comment on individual cases, but it told the BBC that failure to comply with sanctions is a serious offence, and those who breach them could face enforcement actions including financial penalties or referral for criminal prosecution. Its statement added: \u201cHMRC has fined five companies for breaches of the Russia sanctions regulations in the last two years, including a \u00a31m fine issued in August 2023.\u201d But the BBC understands there haven\u2019t been any criminal prosecutions for violating trade sanctions on Russia since February 2022.\n\nTim Ash says the \u201callure of doing business with Russia... is too much for some people\u201d\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith MP, the chair of a committee of MPs working on sanctions against Russia, told the BBC the Crisp case isn\u2019t a \u201cone-off\u201d. \u201cIn terms of prosecution and seriously pursuing people over sanctions, the UK is very poor indeed,\u201d said Sir Iain. \u201cIf we don't prosecute, who the hell is deterred from breaching sanctions? He said other countries including the US, were \u201clight years\u201d ahead of the UK in terms of prosecuting violators. \u201cThere needs to be arrest, prosecution and incarceration. And if we don't do that, then there's no such thing as sanctions.\u201d The former Conservative Party leader said that HMRC often reached settlements, instead of issuing large fines or criminal convictions. \u201cThe authorities may say the sanctions breaches are too small to prosecute, but the answer is you prosecute the small ones, because the big ones need to know that you're coming after them as well,\u201d he added. The UK government had hoped sanctions would be a deterrent, without the need for robust enforcement, according to Tim Ash from the foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe reality is, the allure of doing business with Russia, the huge profits to be made, are too much for some people,\u201d explained Mr Ash. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in their bottom line, as opposed to the bottomless pit of Ukrainians dying.\u201d He said cases like Mr Crisp\u2019s sent a clear message that there would be no consequences for continuing business with Russia. \u201cWe are almost three years into the [full-scale] invasion, and the fact that we haven't got our sanctions regime together is pretty extraordinary.\u201d",
    "Spacecraft launches towards asteroid knocked off course by Nasa\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA spacecraft is on its way to visit an asteroid that US space agency Nasa knocked off course in 2022. The Hera craft launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 10:52 local time (15:52BST) on Monday. It is part of an international mission to see if we can stop dangerous asteroids hitting Earth. The project will look at what happened to a space rock called Dimorphos when Nasa intentionally collided with it.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Hera will reach Dimorphos, around seven million miles away, in December 2026. The Hera mission, which is run by the European Space Agency, is a follow-on from Nasa\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) project. Dimorphos is a small moon 160m-wide that orbits an asteroid close to Earth called Didymos in something called a binary asteroid system. In 2022 Nasa said it successfully changed Dimorphos\u2019s course by crashing a probe into it. It altered the rock\u2019s path by a few metres, according to Nasa\u2019s scientists. The asteroid was not on course to hit Earth, but it was a test to see whether space agencies could do it when there is genuine risk. When it arrives in two years, the Hera craft will look at the size and depth of the impact crater created on Dimorphos.\n\nTwo cube-shaped probes will also study the make-up of the asteroid and its mass. \u201cWe need to understand what are the physical properties of these asteroids? What are they made of? Are they blocks of rock? Are they made of sand inside?\u201d says Naomi Murdoch, a scientist involved with the European Space Agency mission. That should help scientists understand the best way to attempt to intercept other asteroids, which can be many different sizes and shapes, in the future. Scientists do not believe that we are currently at risk of a dinosaur-style extinction caused by an asteroid hitting Earth. An asteroid of that size could be easily spotted in space. The size of asteroid that DART and Hera are targeting are about 100-200m wide and are very difficult to see from our planet. From time to time they hit Earth. On 2013 a house-sized asteroid exploded in the sky above the town of Chelyabinsk in Russia. The shock wave blew out windows for over 200 square miles and damaged buildings. Over 1,600 people were injured in the blast. Scientists hope to one day be able to identify asteroids like this and knock them off course. \u201cIt's not to avoid an extinction of the human race. It's to create a system to minimize the damage as much as we can. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, but we do,\u201d says Prof Murdoch. But scientists warn that even though Nasa has proved it is possible to alter one asteroid\u2019s course, it does not mean it can easily be done on all space rocks. Intercepting an asteroid before it hits Earth also relies on being able to spot the incoming hazard in the first place.\n\nThe Hera craft will take two years to reach the Dimorphos asteroid",

In mid Wales, Aberystwyth Royal Pier in Ceredigion attracts both amusement arcade enthusiasts and roosting starlings who draw crowds when they flock to create magnificent murmurations. In the north, visitors to Bangor Garth Pier are drawn to its art gallery, craft shops and tearoom. On a sunny day in October, angler Jay Lewis was enjoying the peaceful views over the Severn Estuary on Penarth Pier in the Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales.\n\nVisitors can enjoy the sunrise from Penarth's 117-year-old pier\n\nThe 55-year-old had travelled for close to an hour from his home in Pontypool, Torfaen, for the experience. \"I suffer with depression and it's the only thing that helps,\" he explained. \"It's just relaxing and you get plenty of time to think.\"\n\nUnder Penarth pier lies a beach which is popular with cold dippers\n\nJay, a member of Penarth Sea Angling Club, comes for the bass, cod, rays and eels, and also the social interaction. \"I enjoy people coming on to me to see what I\u2019ve been catching,\" he said. \"And it\u2019s easy fishing, you've got the toilets, you\u2019ve got the shops and the views are lovely.\" Penarth Pier, now 117 years old and instantly recognisable with its art deco styled pavilion building, permits fishing for nine months of the year.\n\nPenarth pier is one of John Atkinson's favourite spots to fish\n\nJohn Atkinson, 69, from nearby Llandough, has been angling for 45 years and the pier is his regular spot. \"It takes your mind away from other things. You can just concentrate on the fishing and it takes away all your problems,\" he said. \"You strike up friendships with people where you\u2019ve got something in common. \"I\u2019ve met people from America, Canada, Australia, all over - tourists ask you what you're catching and you strike up conversation.\"\n\nWales' longest pier is in the coastal resort of Llandudno\n\nAlmost 200 miles (321 km) north of Penarth is Wales\u2019 longest pier - Llandudno in the county of Conwy. Originally 242 ft (72m) long on its opening day in 1858, it was extended in 1877 and now stands at 2,295ft (700m).\n\nThe Grade II-listed structure won the National Piers Society, external pier of the year award in 2005. Earlier this year, it was announced its fishing platform would be closed off for the foreseeable future following a number of incidents.\n\n\"The frequency in verbal abuse we\u2019re receiving and constant damage to the gate is relentless,\" its general manager posted on social media, external. \"We wanted everyone to enjoy themselves and unfortunately the minority has ruined it for others.\"\n\nThe town made the headlines during the Covid pandemic when a herd of about 122 Kashmiri goats ventured from the Great Orme and took over the deserted town centre, eating hedges and flowers from gardens. A line of Llandudno goats merchandise, including t-shirts and tote bags, quickly followed and has since raised thousands for the town's hospice. Visitors to New Quay's pier in Ceredigion, mid Wales, can encounter an altogether different wildlife experience.\n\nCardigan Bay is home to about 200 dolphins\n\nMarine life-spotting trips leave from the pier and head into Cardigan Bay, which is home to about 200 dolphins, the only semi-resident population of bottlenose dolphins in Wales, and the largest in the UK. The bay is also home to harbour porpoise, Atlantic grey seals and a variety of bird life including razorbills and guillemots. The stone pier was built in the 1830s and remains essential to industry in the seaside town.\n\nBoat-trippers can also spot seals from Cardigan Bay\n\n\"It is the main focus of the town,\" said skipper Jonathan Evans, who spends his days collecting visitors off the pier before dazzling them with the area's wildlife from his boat the Suncatcher. After spending 19 years as a photographer in London he decided to move home to Wales to help his dad with family business. \u201cWe are privileged to have wild dolphins here and that never gets old, every single day you see wild dolphins and its exciting,\" he said.\n\nJonathan Evans spends his days introducing visitors to the wildlife of Cardigan Bay\n\nSuncatcher crew member Lauren Walthour, who has a degree in Marine Biology, said the structure of the pier created the perfect conditions for dolphins to feed. \"The pier juts out to sea and so when the tides come in and out it forces the fish around the very tip of it, kind of trapping them, and these dolphins will use those tides to get some easy pickings for a meal,\" she said.\n\nNew Quay's stone pier was built in the 1830\n\nShe said it made the pier a \"dolphin hot spot\". She said as Cardigan Bay was shallow, being about 60m at its deepest, it meant the dolphins had no predators, such as orcas or sharks. \"So these dolphins are top of the food chain and the apex predator so this is a really safe, shallow protected nursery for these mothers to raise their calves and that's why their population is currently thriving so well,\" she added.\n\nLauren Walthour is passionate about teaching the public about marine life\n\nShe said everyone who visited was enamoured by the dolphins. \"They are just very charismatic, very playful, very social, very curious and very intelligent and that's why people love them,\" she said. \"Any encounter with them, whether its short or long, is always incredible.\"",
    "Dame Sally Davies said she had worried about someone picking up Novichok from the moment she knew \"Russian agents had been involved\" in the incident\n\nThe former chief medical officer for England said she had experienced nightmares about someone picking up discarded nerve agent after the poisoning of a former spy. Sergei Skirpal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by Novichok in Salisbury in March 2018. The attempted murders were followed by the death of Dawn Sturgess, 44, in July of that year, after she was exposed to the chemical weapon which was left in a discarded perfume bottle. The inquiry into Ms Sturgess' death heard how Dame Sally Davies had worried about someone picking up Novichok from the moment she knew \"Russian agents had been involved\" in the incident.\n\nDawn Sturgess died after being exposed to Novichok in July 2018\n\nIn her witness statement, read to the inquiry by Francesca Whitelaw KC, Dame Sally said she had been concerned \"about the disposal by the foreign agents of any residual nerve agent\". She also said she had raised her concern during at least one meeting, before becoming reassured that the police were hunting for a discarded vial, including by the river in Salisbury, and by the Environment Agency, who would \"monitor the unusual numbers of dead fish appearing in the river\". \u201cThis led to me later saying publicly that no one should pick anything up which they had not dropped,\" she added. Dame Sally said she had later attended a meeting where concerns about the statement and whether it would \"panic the public\" were raised.\n\nShe said the discussion had ended with the agreement that she was independent and experienced and could say what she felt mattered, but she added the only record of her making this statement is her own statement in September when she referred to advice she gave in March. However, the counsel for Ms Sturgess' family, Jesse Nicholls, said Dame Sally had said she had given the advice publicly, \u201cbecause that obviously should have happened but it didn\u2019t\u201d. She replied: \u201cNo, you are trying to suggest there was a cover-up, there was no cover-up.\u201d The inquiry also discussed a letter, dated 16 March, from Dame Sally to Sir Jeremy Heywood which said that on March 7, at the request of No 10 and the Metropolitan Police, she had issued a statement alongside Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley announcing the risk to public health as a result of the incident was \u201clow, based on the current evidence available\u201d.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

Last month, Khao Kheow Open Zoo had to warn visitors not to try to wake up Moo Deng, after the hippo soared in popularity and sparked a surge in visitors to the zoo.",
    "United by loyalty, Trump's new team have competing agendas\n\nIf personnel really does amount to policy, then we\u2019ve learned a lot this week about how Donald Trump intends to govern in his second term. More than a dozen major appointments, some of which will require Senate approval, offer a clearer picture of the team entrusted to drive his agenda as he returns to the White House. On the outside they appear united by one thing - loyalty to the top man. But beneath the surface, there are competing agendas. Here are four factions that reveal both Trump\u2019s ambition and potential tricky tests ahead for his leadership.\n\nTheir agenda: This trio have been among the most vocal politicians actively opposing US policies, particularly under President Biden. Choosing Gaetz as his attorney general nominee is possibly Trump\u2019s most controversial pick. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. A graduate of William and Mary Law School, he led the removal of California congressman Kevin McCarthy as the sitting Speaker of the House in October 2023. He has come under investigation by a House ethics committee for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl, using illegal drugs and misusing campaign funds. He denies wrongdoing and no criminal charges have been filed.\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week Tulsi Gabbard, picked to be Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, is a military veteran who served with a medical unit in Iraq. She is a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who switched parties to support Trump. Gabbard has routinely opposed American foreign policy, blaming Nato for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 then casting doubt on US intelligence assessments blaming Assad for using chemical weapons. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee health, is a longtime lawyer and environmentalist. He also spread fringe theories \u2013 about vaccines and the effects of 5G phone signals.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A look at Trump's cabinet and key roles... in 74 seconds\n\nWhat this tells us: Like Trump, Gaetz, Gabbard and Kennedy are aggressive challengers of the status quo. All three frequently tip over into conspiracy. They may be among the most determined supporters of Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d. The president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health. But bomb-throwers can also make unruly subordinates. Kennedy wants stricter regulation across food and farming industries, which may collide with Trump\u2019s government-slashing agenda. Gaetz\u2019s views on some issues - he favours legalisation of marijuana - are outside the Republican mainstream. And Gabbard, a fierce critic of American power, will be working for a president who is not afraid to use it - for instance, against Iran.\n\u2022 None What RFK could do on vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nTheir agenda: The three hardliners tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s border and immigration policies have vowed to strengthen security and clamp down on undocumented immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. Domestically, they - and the wider incoming Trump administration - have called for a drastic uptick in deportations, beginning with those considered national security or public safety threats, and a return to workplace \u201cenforcement operations\u201d that were paused by the Biden administration.\n\nWhat it tells us: Aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with Mexico were primary concerns for many voters. The possibility of increased deportations and workplace raids, however, could put Trump on a collision course with Democratic-leaning states and jurisdictions that may decide to push back or not co-operate. Some Republican states - whose economies rely, in part, on immigrant labour - may also object.\n\nTheir agenda: Trump has named the world\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk, to lead a cost-cutting effort dubbed the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d. He will share the role with 39-year-old investor-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy, who became an ardent Trump backer after bowing out as a candidate in the Republican primary. The two men are among the loudest and flashiest tech bros, a group that swung towards Trump this year, seeking a champion to disavow \u201cwoke\u201d political correctness and embrace a libertarian vision of small government, low taxes and light regulation. Musk has floated a possible $2tn in spending cuts, vowing to send \u201cshockwaves\u201d through the government. Ramaswamy, who has backed eliminating the tax-collecting agency, the IRS, and the Department of Education, among others, wrote after the announcement: \u201cShut it down.\u201d\n\nWhat it tells us: The appointments are an acknowledgment of the help Trump got on the campaign trail from Ramaswamy and Musk, the latter of whom personally ploughed more than $100m into the campaign. But time will tell what power this faction goes on to have. Despite its name, the department is not an official agency. The commission will stand outside the government to advise on spending, which is partly controlled by Congress. Trump, who ran up budget deficits during his first term, has shown little commitment to cutting spending. He has promised to leave Social Security and Medicare - two of the biggest areas of government spending - untouched, which could make cost-cutting difficult. RFK Jr\u2019s pledge to increase regulation of food additives and ultra-processed foods could also clash with Musk and Ramaswamy\u2019s mandate to cut red tape.\n\nTheir agenda: These men will run Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. They are all hawks on China. Rubio, nominee for secretary of state, is among Beijing\u2019s harshest critics, having argued for travel bans on some Chinese officials and for the closure of Hong Kong\u2019s US trade offices. The three are likely to push through Trump\u2019s pledge for much higher tariffs on Chinese imports. They see Beijing as the top economic and security threat to the US. Waltz - picked for national security adviser - has said the US is in a \u201cCold War\u201d with the ruling communist party. Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director who served as an intelligence chief in his first term, has likened countering China\u2019s rise to the defeat of fascism or bringing down the Iron Curtain.\n\nWhat it tells us: While Trump often signals his own hawkish economic views on China, he has also vacillated - which could spark tensions with his top foreign policy team. In his first term, Trump triggered a trade war with Beijing (attempts to de-escalate this failed amid the pandemic) and relations slumped further when he labelled Covid the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d. But he also heaped praise on President Xi Jinping as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader ruling with an \u201ciron fist\u201d. This unpredictability could make managing America\u2019s most consequential strategic relationship even harder. Rubio might also clash with Gabbard, Trump\u2019s pick for director of intelligence, who previously criticised him on foreign policy, saying he \"represents the neocon, warmongering establishment\".",
    "Two months ago, few outside Minnesota knew Tim Walz. But now the state\u2019s governor is six weeks away from possibly becoming vice-president. What do we know about him?\n\nWalz, 60, taught geography at Mankato West High School in Minnesota and led the school to its first American football state championship. Some of his former players lined up on stage at the Democratic National Convention in August to sing the praises of their former coach. \u201cHe believed in us,\u201d said one.\n\nHe came out of nowhere to be picked as running mate for Harris Few people were talking about the governor of Minnesota as the possible vice-president pick for Kamala Harris in her run for the White House. But some impressive TV performances - including one where he described some Republican policies as \u201cweird\u201d - catapulted him into contention. With a love of hunting and ice fishing, he was seen as representing rural America in a way that Harris, the prosecutor from San Francisco, never could.\n\nHe once taught in China After obtaining his teaching degree, he started a one-year post in China two months after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when the authorities crushed a mass protest. In the vice-presidential debate, he said he had \u201cmisspoken\u201d in the past by saying he was in Hong Kong at the time of the protest. \u201cI\u2019m a knucklehead,\u201d he told the TV audience.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 at the urging of his father who died of lung cancer two years later. He served in the volunteer force for 24 years.\n\nAs governor he became known for free school lunches During the Covid pandemic, access to free school meals was expanded nationwide. After that elapsed, Walz signed a Minnesota state law in 2023 that gave all children access to breakfast and lunch. It became one of his signature, most talked-about achievements.\n\nHe has had to clarify other misleading statements Walz was never deployed to a combat zone and had to correct a speech which resurfaced in recent weeks in which he implied he had. He was also criticised for misstating his rank at retirement. Then he had to clarify what kind of assistance he and his wife Gwen received to help them conceive, to dispel the impression they received IVF.\n\nHis interactions with his daughter are big on TikTok The happy outcome of that difficult fertility journey was their eldest child Hope, now 23. She and her father appear in several widely shared, light-hearted videos that make fun of the generation gap.\n\nHis speech at the Democratic convention was folksy He introduced himself to a national audience in Chicago with Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder in the audience. Teed up by John Mellencamp\u2019s Small Town, he began by emphasising his community values and went on to champion reproductive rights and praise Harris as a tough and experienced leader. Leaning heavily on football metaphors, he finished with: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna leave it all on the field.\u201d\n\nHis son Gus also made headlines that day His children, Hope and Gus, were in tears as he addressed them by name, saying: \u201cYou are my entire world.\u201d Walz\u2019s 17-year-old son could be seen saying \u201cthat\u2019s my dad\u201d, a moment that went viral.\n\nHe faced Republican JD Vance in the VP debate The televised showdown between two Midwesterners was a mostly polite affair in contrast to the presidential candidates a month ago. After a faltering start, Walz had some good moments, notably on teenagers and guns, abortion and the uprising by Trump supporters on 6 January.",
    "Gudjohnsens back at Stamford Bridge and ready to beat Chelsea\n\nEidur Gudjohnsen with son Andri, who faces Chelsea on Thursday\n\nThere are images of a four-year-old Andri Gudjohnsen celebrating the 2005 Premier League title win with his father on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. Now 22 and returning as a striker for KAA Gent, the Iceland international will on Thursday play at the 40,000-seater capacity stadium where his father made history. \"It's quite typical, wasn't it, to get Chelsea in the draw?\" he says. The Gudjohnsen name is legendary around Stamford Bridge as Eidur helped secure the club's first title in 50 years under Jose Mourinho, which helped kickstart the Roman Abramovich era. \"I remember glimpses of those victories,\" Andri adds as he also returns to the city where he was born. He added: \"The first thing I did was call my father. He already knew. It's special for me and for him. I was born when my father played there; it's kind of a unique draw.\" Of course, not only are Chelsea part of the Gudjohnsen family history, but they are the highest-ranked team in the Conference League and will be a huge test for a developing football talent in the Belgian league.\n\nThe Gudjohnsens have all been forwards, inspired by the goalscoring feats of the previous generation.\n\u2022 None Arnor: The grandfather, regarded as a legend at Anderlecht.\n\u2022 None Eidur: Iceland\u2019s most famous and successful player, now watching his sons with pride.\n\u2022 None Sveinn: Eldest son, playing in Norway with Sarpsborg in a career spanning six countries.\n\u2022 None Andri: Middle son - a striker who signed for Gent this season. Andri continues, refering to his grandfather's spell at Anderlecht and his dad's at Club Brugge: \"It's just strange, really, that three generations of a Gudjohnsen player also end up here in the Belgian League and in one of the big teams. \"I wanted to be a goalkeeper when I was younger, but I think seeing my dad score a lot of goals throughout his career probably just inspired us boys. \"We want to score also, and to be kind of the main man up front, the one who scores all the goals. So yeah, it's probably just something that was passed on down the generations.\" Eidur came on for his father when making his international debut. He was also assistant manager when Sveinn set up a goal for Andri in 2021, but being from a footballing family has its pitfalls. \"My father, for example, in Iceland, could barely go out on to the streets without people asking for pictures and signatures, and also in Chelsea and Barcelona. But at the end of the day he was just my dad to me. It's just something that you grow up with. \"My oldest brother perhaps took the biggest hits when it came to being compared to our father since he was the first born. \"You kind of get used to it, and you learn how to deal with it.\" Talking about his father's influence, Andri adds: \"He's found a kind of good balance between not being too critical or too involved in our business when it comes to football, but also being there for us when we need support or his advice.\"\n\nRemarkably, Andri was educated in both the Barcelona and Real Madrid academies during his youth career, never training at Chelsea despite interest from English clubs. It meant training under Madrid's legendary striker Raul in the B team and getting to meet Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Xavi and Andres Iniesta while his father was at Camp Nou. The middle Gudjohnsen son had a turbulent summer as Danish club Lyngby triggered his release clause after a successful loan spell from IFK Norrkoping, before Gent swooped in to sign him less than two months later, which represents an important step in his footballing development. Gent have lost only three of their 15 games this season in all competitions and are also one of the strongest teams in this competition. \u201cThis is a game that any footballer wants to play,\" Andri says. \"We're all excited and we go there with the mindset of taking something out of it. \"We have high expectations this season. We're putting together a young squad full of potential. \"We want to go as far as we possibly can, both in the league and in the Conference League. \"I think we have the quality, the players and the will to do very good things this season.\"",

    "New allegations over surgeon convicted of rape\n\nSalil Korambayil was jailed in 2023 for 14 years for raping two women and in August he was given a further 12 months for the misuse of patient data\n\nMore women have come forward with allegations about a trainee surgeon who was convicted of raping two women in Devon and Cornwall. Salil Korambayil, 33, was jailed in 2023 for 14 years for raping two women and in August he was given a further 12 months for the misuse of patient data. The new allegations made to the BBC include one of rape and one from a woman who says he accessed her medical records and later turned up at her house. The claims have been put to Korambayil\u2019s legal team, but they have not responded.\n\nEmma, which is not her real name, told the BBC the surgeon was a \"predator\" who had stolen everything from her, but she had been afraid no-one would believe her because of what he did for a job. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing. Korambayil first made contact with her when he added her as a friend on Facebook in July 2020. Emma said: \"I messaged him and said: 'Have you added me by mistake?' \"He said he thought he recognised me from the hospital. \"I thought he was probably genuine and then when I found out what he did for a living, very quickly I suppose, I thought he was trustworthy because of what he did.\" At the time Korambayil was working at the North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple.\n\nAfter exchanging messages, Emma said they went on several dates before he invited her to his bedsit. Emma said: \"We started kissing and had consensual sex but during that he had his hands around my throat which I was uncomfortable with as I couldn't breathe properly.\" She said she tried to roll away but could not and he raped her. Emma said she reported it to police at a later date but she was too traumatised to take it further. \"It's taken years for me to piece back who I was before,\" Emma said. \"But I want it public so that other women can come forward if they\u2019ve been in the same position as me, because I think there are others out there.\"\n\nIn 2021, Emma received a letter from the NHS saying her medical records had been unlawfully accessed by an unnamed doctor. A second letter, sent after the surgeon had been jailed, revealed it had been Korambayil. Another woman spoke to the BBC about Korambayil after finding out her medical records had also been accessed without authorisation.\n\nStacey told the BBC she had received letters from the NHS saying her medical records had been accessed by a doctor without authorisation\n\nStacey Loder said Korambayil first contacted her on Facebook in 2020 saying she had come up as a suggested friend and he thought he recognised her from the hospital. He also told her he was a surgeon. Later she was in the North Devon District Hospital to have her appendix out and Korambayil was the surgeon. Stacey told the BBC she raised concerns to the hospital but she has since been told they could not find any record of her complaint. When she returned home she said she received a Facebook message from Korambayil. \"I went home and we messaged that evening,\" she said. \"He made a comment about the operation, saying maybe wait a couple of weeks before I make it up to him for operating on me.\"\n\nStacey said at first she engaged in the messages, but when they became more explicit she stopped replying. She alleges that after she ignored him he turned up at her house, but she did not let him in and told the BBC she had never disclosed her address to him despite him \"asking four times\". Stacey said she \"felt sick\" looking back at the situation. \"He is a surgeon, he knew how vulnerable I was and he just didn\u2019t care.\" Stacey told the BBC she had received letters from the NHS saying her medical records had been accessed by a doctor without authorisation. She said the hospital later confirmed it was Korambayil who had unlawfully accessed her records on two occasions after her surgery. She believes this is how he got her address.\n\nThe Royal Devon University Healthcare Trust said it could not comment on individual cases but had contacted people whose data was accessed \"to provide support\u2026 to patients who wanted to raise any concerns\". It added: \"Our focus throughout has been on being open and transparent, and supporting the victims, both those we are aware of and any more that come to light.\" The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, where he later worked, has also contacted those affected and both hospitals said they were \"appalled\" by Korambayil\u2019s \"abuse\" of \"trust\". Korambayil has applied for leave to appeal the rape convictions.\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",

    "What RFK Jr could do on US vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has announced he wants to appoint vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as the head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The position has a broad remit across the US health industry, including food safety, pharmaceuticals, public health and vaccinations. If his post is confirmed by the US Senate, he would be in charge of key health agencies with about 80,000 employees and a trillion-dollar budget. RFK Jr has long expressed views that conflict with scientific evidence, especially on vaccines, and his nomination has provoked opposition from public health experts. But he has also adopted positions with popular support, scrutinising the use of food additives and urging that the power of big pharma be curbed. The nephew of President JFK, he ran for the White House himself as an independent but dropped out and backed Trump. As secretary, Kennedy would be in charge of huge agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This is where he stands on vaccines, food, fluoride and health agencies.\n\nThe vast majority of health experts champion inoculations for their long history of success - guarding against dangerous diseases and even eradicating deadly smallpox. But as founder of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, Kennedy has for nearly two decades been airing debunked claims about jabs. In recent years, he has gained prominence in the US for making the discredited claim that childhood immunisations are linked to autism. But he has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination and says he had his own children immunised. Kennedy has said that if he were to join the Trump administration, he would want to examine government vaccine safety data and share his findings with the public. He recently denied that he would block or ban vaccinations, however. \"If vaccines are working for somebody, I\u2019m not going to take them away. People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,\" he told NBC News last week. The stock prices of vaccine makers like Moderna, Pfizer and Merck fell after Trump announced his pick.\n\nAnnouncing Kennedy's nomination, Trump said Americans had for too long been \"crushed\" by food and drug companies engaging in \"deception, misinformation, and disinformation\". Kennedy has long blamed the food and drug industries - as well as the regulators who oversee them - for Americans' poor health. He has said that he wants to overhaul the systems that oversee pesticides, herbicides, food additives and pharmaceuticals. He has called for a ban on food dyes and additives, regularly citing Europe's regulatory standards. \"We have 1,000 ingredients in our food that are illegal in Europe that are illegal in other countries and they're making our kids sick,\" he alleged in an NBC News interview. \"They're there because of corruption in our agencies.\" An FDA spokesperson told the BBC that it is necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing estimates of authorised chemicals between the US and Europe. Both \"generally apply the same fundamental scientific approach to safety assessment when evaluating the safety of chemicals in food\", according to the FDA spokesperson. \"Different regulatory definitions and different methodologies can influence the results. Without clarity, comparisons can be misleading,\" the official added. Last month Kennedy accused the FDA on X, external of suppressing the use of \"psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented\". He said that those who were \"part of this corrupt system\" should be prepared to \"pack your bags\". Both ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were held up as miracle cures for Covid but such claims have not been supported by science.\n\u2022 None What do we know about Covid and hydroxychloroquine\n\nKennedy recently vowed to remove fluoride - a cavity-fighting mineral - from the US drinking water, which about two-thirds of Americans have in their water supply. Though it is a decision made by state and local health authorities, Kennedy said on X earlier this month that \"the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water\". He alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists \"is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease\".\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week The US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health. Recent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products. Most of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water. Removing it altogether could still pose a challenge, however, as the federal government does not have the final authority over that decision.\n\nKennedy has long claimed that chronic health issues have worsened due to the inaction of federal health agencies. He said at a rally in Arizona earlier this month that he plans to fire and replace 600 employees at the NIH - which oversees vaccine research - as soon as Trump takes the White House. The longtime lawyer also said last month that he intends \"to have every nutritional scientist\" in the health and agriculture departments fired on day one of a Trump presidency because he alleges they are co-opted by corporate interests. He reportedly intends to take a serious look at those who work at other health agencies as well, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "LinkedIn: We're too boring for kids for social media ban\n\nCareer-networking site LinkedIn has told Australian lawmakers it is too dull for kids to warrant its inclusion in a proposed ban on social media for under 16 year olds. \"LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors,\" the Microsoft-owned company said in a submission to an Australian senate committee. The Australian government has said it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to stop children accessing social media platforms. But companies behind some of the most popular platforms with young people - Meta, Google, Snapchat-owner Snap Inc and TikTok - have all challenged the planned law in submissions made to lawmakers.\n\u2022 None Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the proposed law is to address the harm social media was inflicting on Australian children. He said it was for \"the mums and dads\" who like him were \"worried sick about the safety of our kids online.\" Other countries are closely watching what happens with the legislation with some - including the UK - saying they are open to following suit. Australia's Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee gave respondents one day to comment on the bill, which would amend its existing Online Safety Act. Its report to the Senate, external concludes the bill should pass - providing its recommendations, such as engaging young people in the legislation's implementation, are considered.\n\nHowever, in their responses, the world's biggest tech firms have been setting out why they are unhappy with the proposed law. Google - which owns YouTube - and Instagram-parent Meta have said they needed more time to consider the legislation. Meta said its current form \"will fail to achieve its goal of reducing the burden on parents to manage the safety of young people on social media\". It also claimed it \"ignores the evidence\" presented by child safety and mental health experts - a view shared by Snapchat in its own submission. X (formerly Twitter), meanwhile questioned the legality of the bill's proposals. TikTok Australia said it had \"significant concerns\" with the bill as proposed. Like other platforms commenting on the legislation, it said it \"hinges\" on an ongoing age assurance trial looking at technologies that can effectively check user age. Ella Woods-Joyce, director of public policy for TikTok Australia and New Zealand, wrote in the company's submission that the bill's \"rushed passage poses a serious risk of further unintended consequences\". But LinkedIn has adopted a different approach - arguing in its submission that is a platform which is simply not of any interest to children. Its minimum age requirement of 16 means they cannot access it, the company said, adding it removes child accounts when found. If LinkedIn can successfully argue it should not be included in the legislation it will potentially avoid the cost and disruption involved it introducing additional age verification processes to the site. \"Subjecting LinkedIn\u2019s platform to regulation under the proposed legislation would create unnecessary barriers and costs for LinkedIn\u2019s members in Australia to undertake age assurance,\" it said.\n\nThe Australian government has said it wants to bring in the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year. But experts have said the bill's timeframe and current composition fails to provide an opportunity for adequate scrutiny. Carly Kind, the country's privacy commissioner, said in a LinkedIn post, external on Monday after appearing at a public Senate hearing that she was concerned by \"the widespread privacy implications of a social media ban\". Human rights commissioner Lorraine Findlay called the one-day window for submissions of responses to the legislation \"entirely inadequate\" in a LinkedIn post on Thursday, external. \"We need actual consultation, not just the appearance of it,\" she said. Nonetheless, the Australian government's plans have sparked interest elsewhere. In the UK, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, told the BBC this month that similar legislation was \"on the table.\" France has already introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent- though research indicates almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN.",
    "Is this the final chapter of the Sue Gray saga?\n\nFive weeks after Sue Gray resigned as the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, with the prospect of her being sacked hovering close, she is off again. And just like last time, even the manner of her departure is contested. We have been told the prime minister had decided to withdraw the offer for Ms Gray to be his envoy to the nations and regions. And, we understand, the cabinet secretary, the most senior civil servant in the country, had spoken to her to confirm this. This chain of events is not disputed by other figures in government. But Ms Gray is adamant it was her decision, we are told, and she never spoke directly to the prime minister about it. A friend of Ms Gray told the BBC: \"Sue has taken a decision not to take the role. She\u2019s going to focus on other things.\" They added: \"She\u2019s taken time to think about it properly, talking to stakeholders, but ultimately she\u2019s decided she doesn\u2019t want to do it.\" It appears the prime minister had grown tired of Ms Gray\u2019s failure to actually start the paid, part-time job that she had been demoted into when she left Downing Street. Given 38 days had gone by since it was publicly known she had been offered the new role, it had been clear for some time that she didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nIt seems reasonable to conclude, at the very least, that both sides were having second thoughts. It also seems reasonable to say that a second bout of messy and not entirely consistent briefing from each camp underlines the central truth in all of this - the hurt, the rows, the anger, the mistrust which has been there for all to see. Her apparent lack of enthusiasm was almost immediately evident, when she failed to turn up at the first ever meeting of a new Council of the Nations and Regions in Edinburgh just days into the job. What followed were daily questions to the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman from reporters about whether she had taken up her post. After weeks of stonewalling, an answer: no. One insider got in touch about the envoy role and said: \"We all thought it was a bad idea that would lead to endless drama and probably another resignation down the line.\" In other words, what might have seemed like a mutually convenient layby into which Ms Gray could be shunted, ended up perpetuating a rather public soap opera. Some sceptics had seen the new gig as a non-job from the start. The government saying it isn\u2019t looking to fill the vacancy will do little to dispel that instinct from those who thought it all along. The Scottish National Party MP Pete Wishart mocked the news, telling the Commons: \"We got the crushing news today that our British envoy to Scotland will no longer be coming there to represent this Parliament.\" \"We were practising the street parties and the haka just to be sure that she was properly welcome to the northern territories,\" he added. So, what might happen next? Some have pondered that Ms Gray may be offered a seat in the House of Lords \u2013 but would that revive all of these issues again? Incidentally, beyond all the noise about Ms Gray it is worth reflecting on other more recent changes in Downing Street \u2013 both in personnel and managerial instinct. Two Blair-era Labour advisers are returning to the heart of government in senior roles \u2013 Jonathan Powell as national security adviser and Liz Lloyd as director of policy delivery and innovation. This reconfiguration coincides with Sir Keir Starmer coming to a view four-and-a-half months into the job as prime minister that it isn\u2019t sufficient for No 10 to merely empower government departments to crack on with their work. They need \"a strong team captain\", as one source put it. \"This is the broader part of the post-Sue reset,\" the source added, saying it amounted to a \"significant reassessment\" in how Sir Keir wanted to approach a job he has been learning how best to grapple with. Ms Gray has been a case study in the early difficulties of that grappling, which Downing Street might now finally hope to have put behind it.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Flames rise from a residential building in Russia after a drone attack from Ukraine\n\nRussia and Ukraine have carried out their largest drone attacks against each other since the start of the war. Russia's defence ministry said it intercepted 84 Ukrainian drones over six regions, including some approaching Moscow, which forced flights to be diverted from three of the capital's major airports. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 145 drones towards every part of the country on Saturday night, with most shot down. The barrages come amid expectations that US president-elect Donald Trump may put pressure on both sides to end the conflict.\n\nUkraine's attempted strike on Moscow was also its biggest attack on the capital since the war began, and was described as \"massive\" by the region's governor. Most of the drones were downed in the Ramenskoye, Kolomna and Domodedovo districts, officials said. In Ramenskoye, south-west of Moscow, five people were injured and four houses caught fire due to falling debris, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. It added that 34 drones had been shot down over the town. In September, a woman was killed in a drone attack that hit Ramenskoye. In May last year, two drones were destroyed near the Kremlin in central Moscow and there were several drone attacks on the Moscow City business district. In Ukraine, at least two people were injured after a drone hit the Odesa region. Images showed flames rising from some buildings, as well as aftermath damage. The Ukrainian air force said 62 of Russia's Iranian-made drones were shot down, while 67 were \"lost\". A further 10 left Ukraine's airspace heading back towards Russia, as well as neighbouring Belarus and Moldova, it added. Further strikes were reported overnight into Monday, with Russia saying it had destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones near the regions of Kursk and Belgorod. Meanwhile, five people were killed in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, following an air attack that left residential buildings on fire, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. He said a 45-year-old woman had also been injured and was in hospital.\n\nIt comes as Russian troops reportedly made their largest territorial gains in October since March 2022, according to analysis of Institute for the Study of War data by the AFP news agency. However, Sir Tony Radakin, the UK's chief of defence staff, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Russia had suffered its worst month for casualties since the start of the war. Russian forces suffered an average of about 1,500 dead and injured \"every single day\" in October, he said. There has been intense speculation about how Trump will approach the conflict since his election win in the US. The president-elect regularly said in his election campaign that he could end the war \"in a day\", but has not offered details on how he would do that. A former adviser to Trump, Bryan Lanza, told the BBC that the incoming administration would focus on achieving peace rather than enabling Ukraine to gain back territory from Russia. In response, a spokesperson for Trump distanced the president-elect from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza \"does not speak for him\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke via state media on Sunday of \"positive\" signals from the incoming US administration. He claimed that Trump spoke during his election campaign about wanting peace and not a desire to inflict defeat on Russia. Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky since his election win, a source telling the BBC that the conversation lasted \"about half an hour\". Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war. In his regular evening address to Ukrainians on Sunday, Zelensky said \"the only way to secure a lasting peace\" is for strength and diplomacy to work hand in hand.",

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Sunday, external for high winds gusting up to 70mph (113km/h) on coasts and hills in Cumbria, which began at 03:00 BST and will last until about midnight. A yellow rain warning was also in place across Devon and Cornwall until midday, with strong winds and heavy rain and Dartmoor among the worst affected areas. Meteorologists said Storm Ashley, the first named storm of the season, would see a rapid drop of pressure as it moves in from the Atlantic - a phenomenon called a \"weather bomb\".\n\nHigh tides, strong winds and large waves are expected to cause flooding on the Cumbrian coastline in the afternoon, the Environment Agency has warned, external. Flood gates have been closed Flimby and Maryport, with areas most at risk including Allonby, Maryport, Flimby, Workington, Parton and Whitehaven.\n\nThe strong winds, combined with high tides, could lead to dangerous conditions, including possible delays or cancellations to travel, the Met Office said. It warned of possible power cuts, minor damage to buildings and large coastal waves in Cumbria, bringing debris onto coastal roads and properties. The warning is for wind gusts of 50-60mph (80-97km/h) inland and 60-70mph (97-113km/h) on coasts and hills.\n\nIn the south west, the Met Office said bus and train services would likely be impacted, while disruption on the roads could increase journey times. Interruption to power supplies and other services was also likely. People have been advised people to check road conditions and amend travel plans if necessary, while also preparing for power cuts, with torches and batteries on standby.\n\nElectricity North West said it would \"monitor the network and ensure supplies and teams are available to respond if the storm causes damage to overhead lines\". Richard Moulton, incident manager for Electricity North West, said: \"The forecast is for extremely strong winds across Cumbria and surrounding areas.\" \"Our local teams are on standby and ready to respond quickly to support our customers,\" he added. Meanwhile, rail operator Northern urged customers to check their journey before travelling, external in the North West on Sunday. It said crew shortages and Storm Ashley would affect travel.",

    "Elsom played 75 matches for the Wallabies, which he captained\n\nAn international arrest warrant has been issued for Australian ex-rugby star Rocky Elsom following a conviction for embezzlement in France, French media say. The former captain of Australia's national team was president of RC Narbonne, one of country's most prestigious clubs, in 2015-16. On Friday a court found him guilty of misappropriating a total of \u20ac700,000 (\u00a3586,000). Elsom was convicted in absentia and given a five-year-prison sentence, according to French media. He recently told Sunday Times newspaper that he was living in the Irish capital Dublin.\n\nIn the interview with the British outlet, published on 6 October, Elsom said he was coaching at the Catholic University School, a private school for boys in Dublin. He said planned to live in the city until December. A sporting celebrity in Ireland, the 41-year-old, played for Leinster Rugby in the late 2000s and helped the team win the Heineken Cup, Europe's top club rugby tournament, in 2009. He also appeared 75 times for Australia's national team - nicknamed the Wallabies - between 2005 and 2011. After his retirement he was part of a consortium that bought RC Narbonne. The French court convicted Elsom of abusing corporate assets and forging documents during his time as president of the club, local media reports say. A lawyer involved in the case, Patrick Tabet, is quoted by Ouest-France newspaper as saying that Elsom made a \"completely unjustified\" payment of \u20ac79,000 to a former coach and gave a monthly salary of \u20ac7,200 to an Australian resident who \"never came to Narbonne\". The club was placed into administration and relegated to lower leagues in 2018. The judge handed down a harsher prison term than the two years requested by prosecutors. Mr Tabet said the former Wallabies star was also ordered to pay back some \u20ac705,000 (\u00a3586,000).",

    "Jon Boutcher says the fine is \u201cregrettable\u201d given the PSNI\u2019s budget problems\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said it is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d after failing to have a \u00a3750,000 fine reduced over last year\u2019s major data breach. It had made representations to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) who first announced the penalty in May. Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said the fine was \u201cregrettable\u201d given the PSNI\u2019s budget problems. The breach involved accidentally releasing some personal details on all 9,400 officers and staff in August last year. The UK's information commissioner has said it was the worst data breach his office has ever seen.\n\nThe surnames, initials, rank and roles of the personnel were released under a freedom of information (FoI) request and published online for several hours. The details were later obtained by dissident republicans. The ICO had previously stated the fine would have been \u00a35.6m had it not applied discretion. This allows for lower fines when public bodies are involved, given payment comes from the public purse. The \u00a3750,000 fine is the largest it has ever imposed on a public body in the UK.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the UK Information Commissioner John Edwards said: \"This is the worst data breach that we have seen.\" He said he believes accountability has been held after the PSNI data breach last year, even if no one loses their job. \"I don't agree that no one is being held accountable,\" he said. He said he had no intention of reducing the fine. He said it was \"impossible to imagine the fear and uncertainty this breach caused PSNI officers and staff\". \u201cA lack of simple internal administration procedures resulted in the personal details of an entire workforce, many of whom had made great sacrifices to conceal their employment, being exposed,\" he said. Whilst acknowledging the financial pressures facing the PSNI, he said \"my role as commissioner is to take action to protect people\u2019s information rights and this includes issuing proportionate, dissuasive fines\".\n\nThe PSNI set to be fined \u00a3750,000 amid budget problems\n\nMr Boutcher said the fine would \u201cfurther compound\u201d the PSNI\u2019s financial situation. It currently has a \u00a334m shortfall in its budget. \u201cAs a service we are in a different place today than we were last August and we have continued to work tirelessly to devalue the compromised dataset by introducing a number of measures for officers and staff,\" he said. \u201cWe have provided significant crime prevention advice to our officers and staff and their families via online tools, advice clinics and home visits.\u201d The Police Federation also expressed disappointment at the fine. \u201cA fine of this magnitude on an already cash-strapped PSNI will have a negative impact on the organisation,\" its chairman Liam Kelly said. \u201cWe would have preferred if PSNI could have been permitted to alternatively spend the funds on enhancing its data security and provide much needed reinvestment in community initiatives such as road safety and CCTV partnerships with councils.\u201d The PSNI is currently involved in settling a damages case brought by up to 7,000 of those impacted.",

    "Why fight for justice isn't over in India's 'horrific' widow-burning case, 37 years on\n\nRoop Kanwar was burned to death on her husband's funeral pyre\n\nIt was a case that made headlines globally and led to widespread condemnation. A teenaged widow was burned on her husband's funeral pyre under the Hindu practice of sati 37 years ago. Now Roop Kanwar\u2019s story has returned to headlines in India after a court acquitted eight men accused of glorifying her death, in the last of the remaining cases in the grisly saga. Sati was first banned in 1829 by the British colonial rulers, but the practice had continued even after India\u2019s independence in 1947. Kanwar is recognised as India\u2019s last sati. The outrage over her death forced the Indian government to introduce a tough new law \u2013 Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 \u2013 banning the practice and, for the first time, also its glorification. It mandated death or life term for those committing sati or abetting it. But over the years, everyone accused of involvement in Kanwar\u2019s death and the glorification that followed has been cleared by courts.\n\u2022 None This report contains some distressing details Last week\u2019s order has also led to outrage, with women\u2019s organisations and activists expressing concern that no-one has been held accountable over her death. Fourteen women\u2019s groups in Rajasthan have written a letter to Chief Minister Bhajan Lal asking him to ensure the government challenges the order in the high court and also makes all attempts to prevent glorification of sati. Coming after such a long delay, these acquittals could \u201creinforce a culture of sati glorification\u201d, they wrote. A lawyer acting for the eight accused told BBC Hindi that they were acquitted because \u201cno evidence was found against them\u201d. I asked Rajasthan\u2019s Justice Minister Jogaram Patel whether the government planned to appeal the decision. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet received a copy of the judgement. We will examine it on its merits and demerits and then decide whether to appeal or not,\u201d he told me. When asked about why the government hadn\u2019t appealed the earlier acquittals, he said those cases had happened before his time and he was not aware of the details.\n\nRoop Kanwar had been married for just seven months to Maal Singh when he died\n\nThe death of the 18-year-old in Deorala village on 4 September 1987 was a huge public spectacle. Watched by hundreds of villagers, it was described as a blot on Rajasthan and India. Her husband\u2019s family and others from their upper-caste Rajput community said Kanwar\u2019s decision had been in keeping with the tradition of sati and was voluntary. They said she had dressed up in her bridal finery and led a procession around the village streets, before climbing into the pyre of Maal Singh, her husband of seven months. She then placed his head in her lap and recited religious chants while slowly burning to death, they added. It was a claim contested by journalists, lawyers, civil society and women\u2019s rights activists \u2013 and initially, even by Kanwar\u2019s parents. They lived in the state capital, Jaipur, just two hours from the village, but learnt of their son-in-law\u2019s death and their daughter\u2019s immolation from the next day\u2019s newspaper. But they later said they believed their daughter\u2019s act had been voluntary. Critics said the retraction had come under pressure from powerful politicians who used the incident to mobilise the Rajput community for \u201cvote-bank politics\u201d.\n\nSome still visit the spot where Roop Kanwar died to light a lamp\n\nIn the days following Kanwar\u2019s death, both sides held high-decibel protests. The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with activists protesting for justice, criticism of the Congress-led state government, and a letter to the Rajasthan chief justice calling for a ban on celebrations. Despite the court ban, 200,000 people attended a ceremony 13 days after Kanwar\u2019s death, where framed photos and posters of her were sold, transforming, external Deorala into a profitable pilgrimage site. Shortly after, two separate reports concluded that Kanwar \u201cwas hounded by villagers to commit sati\u201d and her immolation was \u201cfar from voluntary\u201d. Journalist Geeta Seshu, who visited the village as part of a three-member team three weeks after the incident, told the BBC that \u201cthe situation on the ground was tense and fraught\u201d. \u201cThe Rajput Sabha had taken over the entire place and the atmosphere was very charged. The spot where Roop had died was surrounded by sword-wielding young men. They were going around it in circles and it was very difficult for us to speak to eyewitnesses.\u201d But the trio still managed to get some testimonies from villagers that went into Trial by Fire, external, their damning fact-finding report.\n\nWomen's organisations protested in Delhi and other cities against Kanwar's death\n\n\u201cPreparations for the sati began immediately after Maal Singh's body was brought to the village in the morning. Roop, who got an inkling of this, escaped from the house and hid in the nearby fields,\u201d they wrote. \u201cShe was found cowering in a barn and dragged to the house and put on the pyre. On her way, she is reported to have walked unsteadily surrounded by Rajput youths. She was also seen to have been frothing at the mouth\u201d - suggesting that she had been drugged. \u201cShe struggled to get out when the pyre was lit, but she was weighed down by logs and coconuts and youths with swords who pushed her back onto the pyre. Eyewitnesses reported to the police that they heard her shouting and crying for help,\u201d the report added. Ms Seshu says \u201cone may couch it in the language of valour and sacrifice, but it was nothing but a horrific murder\u201d. She says when she met Kanwar\u2019s parents and brothers, \u201cthey were angry and willing to fight. But they later changed their stance under pressure from community leaders\u201d. Her eldest brother Gopal Singh disputes this, and told the BBC they initially suspected foul play. \u201cBut our aunts who lived in Deorala told us that it was Roop\u2019s decision. So, the elders in the family decided to drop it. There was no pressure on us.\u201d Mr Singh later went on to join the Sati Dharma Raksha Samiti \u2013 a committee formed to valorise Kanwar\u2019s immolation \u2013 and became its deputy chief. After its glorification was made illegal, the group dropped sati from its name. He said he had spent 45 days in prison on charges of sati glorification but was acquitted in January 2004 for \u201clack of evidence\u201d.\n\nRajput organisations organised protests in support of their right to worship goddess Sati\n\nMs Seshu says the general consensus when they visited the village after the incident was that \u201csati happens, women do it. The police and administrations were so complicit in the celebrations that no genuine efforts were made to collect evidence or fix responsibility\u201d. What was most tragic, she adds, was that Kanwar\u2019s death was used by the Rajput community as a mobilising force to benefit them politically and to make money. \u201cThe supporters wanted to build a temple at the site but the new law which banned sati glorification also barred construction of temples or collection of money from visitors. Now this acquittal could open the gates for a revival of religious tourism to the place.\u201d In Deorala, the spot at the edge of the village where Kanwar died, still attracts some visitors all these years later. A photograph taken a year back shows a family lighting a lamp before a framed picture of Kanwar and her husband, placed under a small brick structure draped with a red and gold scarf. But despite Kanwar\u2019s deification, chances of justice for India\u2019s last sati remain dim.",

    "Apple accused of trapping and ripping off 40m iCloud customers\n\niCloud is the online storage service from Apple\n\nApple is facing a legal claim accusing it of effectively locking 40 million British customers into its iCloud service and charging them \"rip off prices\". Consumer group Which? says the legal action - which it has launched - could result in a \u00a33bn payout if it is successful, with the average customer getting around \u00a370. Apple has rejected the suggestion its practices are anti-competitive, saying users are not required to use iCloud. It said many customers rely on third-party alternatives, and insists it \"works hard to make data transfer as easy as possible\". It is another example of the \"growing tide of large class actions against big tech\" which has \"operated without sufficient constraint\", Toby Starr from legal firm Humphries Kerstetter told the BBC. Facebook, Google, gaming giant Steam and the UK's leading mobile providers are among the others facing legal claims at the same court, the Competition Appeal Tribunal. \"Although most of these claims are in their infancy and take a long time to resolve, there will be more decisions coming out over the next couple of years and there will be settlements - these will start to affect the tech giants\u2019 businesses,\" said Mr Starr.\n\nUsers of Apple products get a small amount of digital storage for free \u2013 and after that are encouraged to pay to use its iCloud service to back up photos, videos, messages, contacts and all the other content which lives on their device. Prices for this storage range from \u00a30.99 a month for 50GB of space to \u00a354.99 a month for 12TB. Apple does not allow rival storage services full access to its products. It says that is for security reasons - but it also contributes to the company's enormous revenues, external. Which? says over a period of nine years dating back to 2015 Apple has been effectively locking people into its services - and then overcharging them. \"By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions,\" the body's chief executive Anabel Hoult said. \"Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.\" \"We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anti-competitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise,\" it said in a statement.\n\u2022 None Why it is becoming easier to sue Big Tech in the UK\n\nWhich? says the legal action will be funded by Litigation Capital Management, and the consumer group has instructed the international law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Which? said the firm would be paid fees as the case progressed, getting additional payments if it was successful - but they would not be getting a percentage of any damages. Alan Davis, from law firm Pinsent Masons, said there were very likely to be more, similar cases in the future. \"It is inevitable that further claims of this nature will continue to be brought given the very high value of the aggregate damages and the role of and incentive for litigation funders to support these claims which might not otherwise be brought without that financial support,\" he told the BBC. He added the absence of any infringement decisions under EU or UK competition law meant it would be down to the claimant to prove the market abuse it was alleging was actually taking place. However, he pointed out the regulator had announced a wider investigation into cloud services, external in the UK. Legal actions against big tech firms can take years as they work their way through the courts. Which? has urged Apple to resolve this \"without the need for litigation\", and wants the tech giant to offer consumers their money back and to open up competition further.",

The inquiry heard that:\n\u2022 None Staff received a report in 2015, at the time the hospital opened, which indicated that the water supply was at a high risk of infection\n\u2022 None Head of estates Ian Powrie, who commissioned the mandatory report, admitted he \"dropped the ball\" and had not read the document until three years later.\n\u2022 None The hospital's second in charge, Dr Jennifer Armstrong, admitted being \u201ctaken aback\u201d that the hospital had \u201cnot been built right\u201d - but did not believe there was evidence the problems with the building caused the unusual infections.\n\u2022 None Dr Christine Peters, a senior microbiologist and former infection control doctor who became a whistleblower, said she still had ongoing concerns about the building and that there was a \u201cserious problem with culture which does not value honesty\u201d.\n\u2022 None The chairman of an independent investigation concluded there was a likely link between some infections in child cancer patients and the contaminated water supply. But Prof Mike Stevens said he felt the health board's chief executive had tried to \u201cturn the screw\u201d on him to alter the findings of his review. Affected families told BBC Scotland News that three years on from giving their evidence to the inquiry, they had heard nothing to reassure them the problems at the hospitals had been fully addressed. They also claimed that senior executives were more concerned with protecting the reputation of the hospital than patient safety.\n\nCharly contracted a number of infections during her time in hospital\n\nMark Bisset, from Peebles, still takes his 12-year-old daughter Charly to the Royal Hospital for Children for routine appointments. She was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2019 at the age of seven and underwent a stem cell transplant in the adult hospital because the child cancer wards were closed after a series of infection outbreaks. Charly also contracted a number of infections during her five-month inpatient stay, which he believes could have come from the building. \u201cFour times our other children had to come in and say goodbye to their sister,\u201d said Mr Bisset. Charly is now cancer free but still requires support for ongoing health issues. Mr Bisset says the family are still \u201cpetrified\u201d every time they visit the hospital. \u201cYou get the fear. I\u2019ve asked for her care to be moved to Edinburgh because I just don\u2019t trust that hospital any longer, I don\u2019t feel it is safe,\u201d he said. He said listening to the evidence at the inquiry had been hard, but that \u201cyou need the truth to come out\u201d.\n\nMaureen Dynes\u2019 husband Tony died in 2021 after cancer treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital\n\nLike other families we have spoken to, Mark says he does not trust senior figures at the health board - and that he has never been given assurances that the hospital is now safe. \"They are denying there is a link between the infections and the hospital,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve heard all this evidence where they deny there is a link, but when you go back there are still filters on the taps. \"If there wasn\u2019t a problem then why do they need filters on the taps?\" Maureen Dynes\u2019 husband Tony, 63, died in 2021, after cancer treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Maureen, from East Kilbride, only learned her husband had contracted two infections, stenotrophomonas and aspergillus, after requesting his medical records. She said some of the information coming out from the inquiry made her \u201cfeel sick\u201d and that it was \"disgusting\" the health board could have known about the problems. \"There is a clear lack of transparency,\" she said. \"If there was honesty and transparency about the state of the building it would allay some of the fears for people going in.\"\n\nThe inquiry is examining on the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus\n\nWhile work has been done on the water and ventilation in the children's wards, she was not aware of any changes to the ward where Tony was treated. \"It\u2019s the only bone marrow transplant ward in Scotland, it's where were are told is the safest place to go - but my experience is it's not as safe as it should be,\" she added. Louise Slorance\u2019s husband Andrew died from Covid while being treated for cancer at the hospital in 2020 and also tested positive for aspergillus. She still thinks there is a failure of governance and effective management at the hospitals, and that an interim report is \u201cvital\u201d due to what she believes is \u201can ongoing patient safety risk\u201d. Patrick McGuire - a partner with Thompsons Solicitors, which represents many families at the inquiry - said the evidence at the inquiry made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that the hospital was \u201cunsafe for patients and riddled with management failures from the beginning\u201d. He said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t know if the hospital is now safe and this is of huge concern to my clients. \u201cThis is why it\u2019s vital that the inquiry consider publishing an interim report on the current levels of safety and what still has to be done to ensure the welfare of patients.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Hospitals Inquiry is being chaired by Lord Brodie\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the inquiry said: \u201cIn order to get to that final report as quickly as possible, Lord Brodie\u2019s approach is to focus on the final report.\u201d The inquiry is due to hear further evidence next April before closing hearings in August 2025. In a statement, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: \u201cWe can provide absolute assurance to all of our patients, families, staff and the public that our hospitals are safe. \u201cThis is clearly evidenced by publicly available indicators of safety collected and monitored at a local and national level. \"Mandatory surveillance of healthcare associated infections demonstrates NHSGGC consistently performs better than many other boards across Scotland and mortality rates at the QEUH campus are in line with, and at times lower than, the Scottish average.\u201d The health board said it would continue to support the inquiry to fully establish the facts. \"We extend our sympathies to any families who have lost loved ones in our care and all those affected during the inquiry,\u201d it added.",
    "Our era has been labelled \u201cthe algorithmic society\u201d \u2013 one in which, it could be argued, social media platforms and search engines govern speech in the same way nation states once did.\n\nThis means straightforward guarantees of freedom of speech in the US constitution can only get you so far, according to Jack Balkin of Yale University, external: \u201cthe First Amendment, as normally construed, is simply inadequate to protect the practical ability to speak\u201d.\n\nProfessors Riemer and Peter agree that the law needs to play catch-up. \u201cPlatforms play a much more active role in shaping speech than the law currently recognises.\u201d\n\nAnd, they claim, the way in which harmful posts are monitored also needs to change. \u201cWe need to expand how we think about free speech regulation. Current debates focused on content moderation overlook the deeper issue of how platforms' business models incentivise them to algorithmically shape speech.\u201d\n\nWhile Professor Candeub is a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d, he\u2019s also wary of the power concentrated in the platforms that can be gatekeepers of speech via computer code. \u201cI think that we would do well to have these algorithms made public because otherwise we're just being manipulated.\u201d\n\nYet algorithms aren\u2019t going away. As Bertram says, \u201cThe difference between the town square and social media is that there are several billion people on social media. There is a right to freedom of speech online but not a right for everyone to be heard equally: it would take more than a lifetime to watch every TikTok video or read every tweet.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, is the solution? Could modest tweaks to the algorithms cultivate more inclusive conversations that more closely resemble the ones we have in person?\n\nNew microblogging platforms like Bluesky are trying to offer users control over the algorithm that displays content \u2013 and to revive the chronological timelines of old, in the belief that offers an experience which is less mediated.\n\nIn testimony she gave to the Senate in 2021, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said, external: \u201cI\u2019m a strong proponent of chronological ranking, ordering by time\u2026 because we don\u2019t want computers deciding what we focus on, we should have software that is human-scaled, or humans have conversations together, not computers facilitating who we get to hear from.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Professor Narayanan has pointed out, \u201cChronological feeds are not \u2026 neutral: They are also subject to rich-get-richer effects, demographic biases, and the unpredictability of virality. There is, unfortunately, no neutral way to design social media.\u201d\n\nPlatforms do offer some alternatives to algorithms, with people on X able to choose a feed from only those they follow. And by filtering huge amounts of content, \u201crecommendation engines provide greater diversity and discovery than just following people we already know\u201d, argues Bertram. \u201cThat feels like the opposite of a restriction of freedom of speech \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism for discovery.\u201d",

    "Lib Dem leader Ed Davey in bid for Christmas No 1\n\nSir Ed Davey spent much of the summer trying to get to No 10 (Downing Street). Now he has set his sights higher, as he launches a bid to get to No 1 - No 1 in the Christmas singles charts that is. The Liberal Democrat leader is teaming up with the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir to release the charity single, Love is Enough. The song was written by six young carers and former carers, and celebrates the bond they have with the people they care for. Proceeds from the single will go towards supporting the Carers Trust and the Bath Philharmonia.\n\nSir Ed, who as a teenager nursed his mother when she had terminal cancer, said he hoped the song would \"strike a chord\" with carers and their families. \"When I heard the opening lyrics to Love is Enough - 'every second we have left is worth a thousand others' - they struck home and meant so much,\" he said. Jason Thornton, music director of Bath Philharmonia, said: \u201cWhen creating Love is Enough, the young carers shared a profound message: Love is everywhere, even when it\u2019s taken for granted. \"They wanted to remind us all that, no matter who or where you are, there is always someone out there for you.\"\n\nAs far as we can tell, Sir Ed is the first leader of a major political party to release a Christmas single (although in 2017 Lord Buckethead put out his festive song, A Bucketful of Happiness). The single is just the latest in a series of headline-grabbing antics the Liberal Democrats have deployed in recent years. Throughout the general election, Sir Ed took part in increasingly eye-catching stunts, starting with a paddle-boarding excursion in Windemere and culminating in a bungee jump in Eastbourne. It seemed to pay off with the party winning a record number of seats and becoming Westminster's third largest party. At his party's conference earlier this year, he continued to embrace his 'embarrassing dad' persona, leading party members in a less-than-tuneful rendition of Abba's Take A Chance On Me. Those hoping to hear Sir Ed on lead vocals in the new single may be disappointed. In Love is Enough, Sir Ed perhaps wisely leaves the bulk of the singing to the members of the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir. He joins in at the bridge around three quarters of the way through the song and during the chorus - but there is no big show-stopping solo.\n\nSir Ed faces stiff competition from perennial Christmas favourites such as Mariah Carey\n\nDuring the general election Sir Ed's main rivals included Rishi Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage. Now, in his bid for chart-topping glory, he faces competition from the likes of Ed Sheeran, Tom Grennan and the 40th anniversary remake of Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas. There are also other challengers in the field of charity singles. The Celebs (including ex-boxer Frank Bruno and The Chase's Anne Hegarty) have released a cover of All You Need is Love to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital. Reverend and The Makers are putting out Late Night Phonecall to support the Samaritans. Although Sir Ed may be challenging some big names, there is a fine tradition of choirs making it to number one at Christmas - so he may have chosen a perfect musical coalition by teaming up with the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir. St Winifred's School Choir famously kept John Lennon off the Christmas top slot in 1980 with There's No-One Quite Like Grandma. They were followed by the Military Wives in 2011 and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir in 2015. But getting a Christmas number one is more complicated than it used to be, when the winner was simply the one which had sold the most singles. These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded). As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required. But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York. A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year. Wham! racked up 13.3 million streams a year ago to clinch that accolade \u2013 so if over the next few weeks we notice Sir Ed and his fellow Lib Dems frantically tapping at their phones, we will know the reason why.",
    "Number of homeless people in Wales at record high\n\nCharmaine Denton is among the 6,447 households living in temporary accommodation in Wales\n\nCharmaine Denton has been waiting more than two years for a permanent home and she is far from the only one. The 38-year-old is \"scratching at the door\" to move after three years in supported housing, which she said had affected her mental health and left her feeling like her life was on hold. Homelessness is at a record level in Wales and the number using temporary accommodation, such as B&Bs, has risen by 18% to 6,447 in 2023-24. Charmaine, from Carmarthenshire, said: \"I was hoping to put up my own Christmas tree this year. I just want somewhere to call home - that's what everyone deserves, isn't it?\"\n\nShe moved into care when she was three and had a chaotic childhood. By 14 she was living in temporary accommodation and had her first flat two years later. \"I wasn't ready to be self-reliant and run my own property. I don't think many 16-year-olds are,\" she said.\n\nShe takes full responsibility for her actions but said a lack of support and a life of chaos led to her taking heroin and crack cocaine. \"You don't recognise you're going to be really heavily into drugs when you're 16, you just think it's one big party.\"\n\nShe lost her flat, went to prison, slept on the streets and lived in temporary accommodation. \"It was hard trying to stay clean there. I'm not blaming anyone, but there's only so much you can keep away from it when people are fighting in the hallway and they're up at three in the morning, knocking your door flat out.\" Charmaine now lives in a shared recovery-focused house run by homeless charity, The Wallich. Hers is one of nine rooms with a bathroom and kitchenette and she is proud to have changed her life and wants to give something back.\n\n\"My past made me stronger, I don't look at it as bad - I look at it as experience. I'm hoping I can turn it round into a positive,\" she added. She wants to continue voluntary work but cannot until she finds a permanent home. This year will be her fourth Christmas in temporary accommodation.\n\nJamie-Lee Cole from The Wallich said Charmaine's situation was an example of the bottleneck in temporary accommodation where there was a \"swelling\" of people needing it but with nowhere to move them on to. She said as well as the effect on Charmaine's mental health, for some there was a risk of relapse or reoffending.\n\nHomelessness is currently at the highest level since 2015, external - 13,539 households in 2023-24, up 8% in a year. The Bevan Foundation think tank said, external one in every 215 households and six in every 1,000 children now live in temporary accommodation.\n\nNewport, the fastest-growing city in Wales, has the highest homeless rate in the country - it has risen by more than 50% over the past year to a record 1,359 households. In September 2024, 594 households lived in temporary accommodation at a cost of \u00a36.5m to the city's council, up \u00a31.4m on the previous year.\n\nHousing advice and prevention officer for Newport City Council, Hannah Berry, said that each day is different at the housing options drop in service\n\nThursday mornings are busy at the housing drop-in service at Newport Central Library. Housing advice and prevention officer Hannah Berry said: \"People can be very angry, upset, frustrated... they just want a home.\" She said the hardest part of the job was turning people away \"We do our very best to help everybody, but we're restricted by budget, lack of housing, lack of provision and lack of other services.\" As a mother herself, she said it was particularly difficult to see families with children \"facing the toughest thing in their lives\".\n\nKath Howells, service manager for housing at Newport council, said it was the most challenging time in the 20 years she has worked in the sector\n\nKath Howells from Newport council said Wales was feeling the brunt of the housing crisis, with private rented homes too expensive for most people and a lack of other options. She said high demand and a very low turnover of housing association stock meant they could not \"move people into the homes they need and deserve\". She encouraged people at risk of losing their home to speak to the council as quickly as possible.\n\nSteffan Evans from The Bevan Foundation, external said the percentage of social homes as the total of the housing stock had almost halved in 40 years. \"We know that the Welsh government has got its 20,000 affordable homes target... but that target can't be the end, we need to go further than that,\" he said.\n\nThe Welsh government said tackling homelessness was a priority and it had \"allocated record levels of funding\" since 2021 - \u00a31.4bn - and was investing nearly \u00a3220m in homelessness prevention and housing support this year. A spokesman added: \"The increase in people being supported with temporary accommodation reflects the ongoing pressures within the system and the effects of the cost-of-living crisis on individuals and households.\"",
    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nSara Sharif begged her parents for forgiveness for \u201cbeing rude\u201d in a letter discovered after her death, a court has heard. The 10-year-old\u2019s letters and notebook were seized by police after her body was found with dozens of injuries at the family\u2019s home in Woking, Surrey, last year. The court previously heard that Sara had been hooded, burned and beaten during more than two years of abuse. Sara\u2019s father Urfan Sharif, 42, stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder and causing or allowing her death.\n\nOfficers went to the family\u2019s house the day after Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Sara's five brothers and sisters on 9 August 2023. In an undated and misspelled letter to Mr Sharif and Ms Batool shown to jurors, Sara wrote that she was \u201csorry for being rude\u201d and \u201canswering back\u201d. \u201cPlease forgive me. I am so, so sorry,\u201d it said. In a birthday message to her father, Sara wrote: \u201cI love you so much. Thank you for looking after us on the weekends. And making food for us at the weekends. Thank you dad. From Sara. \u201cOur family is the best in town. We spread love all around the world.\u201d Her notebook also contained a short fairy tale about a queen called Beinash and a princess called Sara. Sara also described Ms Batool as the \u201cbest caring and loving mother in the world\u201d in the notebook.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nAt the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Cavanagh also told the jury that they may consider an alternative charge of manslaughter. He said while murder and causing or allowing the death of a child were the charges on the indictment, manslaughter could also be considered if the jury was not certain that murder had been proved. For a conviction on a charge of manslaughter, the jury must be sure that the defendants intended to cause \u201csome physical harm\u201d, he added.\n\nA post-mortem examination found Sara had suffered injuries including \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water before she died on 8 August 2023. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC previously said a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. Under cross-examination, Mr Sharif previously accepted \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Sara's death, but later denied intending to kill her. He also told the jury he was lying when he called his wife, Ms Batool, a \u201cpsycho\u201d earlier in the trial. Mr Sharif admitted beating Sara, but denied biting or burning her.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

The menu at Nottingham's Lace Market Fish Bar is typically a variety of fish and chips, kebabs and burgers, but on Wednesday night it served up something different. In the first night of its kind for the chippy, it hosted local grime and garage MC Window Kid and British DJ Nathan Dawe. The floor shook as the event spilled on to the streets and staff said people could not wait for the next one.\n\nThe Window Kid from Arnold, known to friends as Greg, has been a regular customer of the Lace Market Fish Bar for years. \"It's my local chippy, and we thought it was a place where everyone's welcome,\" he said.\n\nMC Window Kid and DJ and producer Nathan Dawe performed a new song\n\nWith 24 hours' notice, the micro-rave sold 35 tickets, but hundreds more attended, the MC said. \"It couldn't have gone any better.

    "Putin says Russia will use new missile again in 'combat conditions'\n\nRussia has a stock of powerful new missiles \"ready to be used\", President Vladimir Putin has said, a day after his country fired a new ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an unscheduled TV address, the Russian leader said the Oreshnik missile could not be intercepted and promised to carry out more tests, including in \"combat conditions\". Russia's use of the Oreshnik capped a week of escalation in the war that also saw Ukraine fire US and British missiles into Russia for the first time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for world leaders to give a \"serious response\" so that Putin \"feels the real consequences of his actions\".\n\nHis country was asking Western partners for updated air defence systems, he added. According to news agency Interfax-Ukraine, Kyiv is seeking to obtain the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), or to upgrade its Patriot anti-ballistic missile defence systems. In Friday's address Putin said the Oreshnik hypersonic missiles flew at 10 times the speed of sound and ordered them to be put into production. He had earlier said that use of the missile was a response to Ukraine's use of Storm Shadow and Atacms missiles. Thursday's strike on Dnipro was described as unusual by eyewitnesses and triggered explosions which went on for three hours. The attack included a strike by a missile so powerful that in the aftermath Ukrainian officials said it resembled an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Justin Crump, CEO and founder of the risk advisory company Sibylline, told the BBC that Moscow likely used the strike as a warning, noting that the missile - which is faster and more advanced that others in its arsenal - has the capacity to seriously challenge Ukraine's air defences.\n\nThis week's escalation has also prompted several warnings from other world leaders about the direction of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the war was entering a decisive stage - with a real risk of global conflict. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban meanwhile said the West should take Vladimir Putin's warnings \"at face value\" because Russia \"bases its policies primarily on military power\". And North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un warned \"never before\" had the threat of a nuclear war been greater and accused the US of having an \"aggressive and hostile\" policy towards Pyongyang. North Korea has sent thousands of troops to fight on Russia's side and Ukrainian forces have reported clashes with them in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops are occupying some territory. US President Biden has said he gave Ukraine permission to use longer-range Atacms missiles against targets inside Russia as a response to Moscow's use of North Korean troops. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both countries are now trying to secure a battlefield advantage before Donald Trump becomes US president in January. Trump has vowed to end the war within hours but has not provided details as to how. In his nightly address, Zelensky also criticised China for its response to Moscow's new missile after China's foreign ministry said all parties should \"remain calm and exercise restraint\". \"From Russia, this is a mockery of the position of states such as China, states of the Global South, some leaders who call for restraint every time,\" he said. He also criticised the Ukrainian parliament for postponing a session on Friday over security concerns following the attack on Dnipro. In a post on Telegram, he said unless an air raid signal sounded everyone should work as normal - and not take Russian threats as \"permission to have a day off\". \"The siren sounds - we go to shelter. When there is no siren - we work and serve. There is no other way in war,\" he said.",
    "Sperm donor compensation has risen from \u00a335 to a maximum of \u00a345 per clinic visit. The \u00a310 rise comes into effect in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1 October, when egg donor compensation also rises from \u00a3750 to \u00a3985, which the fertility regulator clarified today. It is illegal to pay someone to donate sperm or eggs in the UK so the money is to cover expenses such as travel and accommodation. Sperm donation can involve visiting a clinic once a week for three to six months. The UK fertility regulator acknowledged a shortage of egg and sperm donors. But it warned donating was a \"complex decision\" and any child born had the right to contact their biological parents after reaching 18 years old.\n\nOne sperm donor, who the BBC is calling Joseph, said the \u00a335 he received for each clinic trip did not compensate him \"anywhere near enough\" for his time and travel - but said his motivation was to help people. \"I'm a married gay man and we adopted our son so we didn't have the normal route that most heterosexuals couples will have had into parenting,\" he said. \"Going through the adoption process, you meet a lot of straight couples who have had fertility problems. So I wanted to help and give someone a chance to start a family, whether it's someone with fertility problems, a lesbian couple or a single person.\" It is the first time compensation for sperm and egg donors in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has risen since 2011. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which sets the amount of compensation, said the change was partly due to inflation being high in recent years, but it warned against donating sperm or eggs for the money. \"Choosing to become a donor is a complex decision, with implications for the donor and their wider family, the recipient, and any child born as a result,\" a spokesperson for the fertility regulator said. \"Donors will go through rigorous medical screening and must be comfortable with the fact that any children born from their donation can contact them when they turn 18,\" the HFEA spokesperson said. Joseph said he was happy with the new compensation rate of \u00a345 per clinic visit. He added: \"I think it's difficult to strike a balance between compensating somebody and then paying too much and then making it a financial incentive.\" But there are groups who are concerned about the rise in compensation. Helen Gibson, founder of Surrogacy Concern, a UK group which campaigns on issues relating to surrogacy and gamete donation said the organisation did not support \"any payment for gametes\". \"Donations cannot be called altruistic while money is exchanged,\" she said. \"Young people\u2019s bodies are not resources to be mined for the benefit of older, wealthier couples and individuals. If there is a \u2018shortage\u2019 of donors coming forward, perhaps that reflects the fact that most people do not want their genetic children to be raised by others.\"\n\u2022 None Egg donors warned not to do it for the \u00a3986 cash\n\nOne way to tackle a sperm shortage is by importing it. The HFEA says the majority of imported sperm in the UK comes from sperm banks in the US and Denmark. Nicole Nel, operations and laboratory manager at the London Sperm Bank, believes the shortage is not due to a \"lack of applicants\" in the UK, but \"the lack in the quality of the applicants\". She also claimed the way people live their lives nowadays could be affecting the quality of sperm, adding that the London Sperm Bank can only accept a small percentage of people who apply to be donors. Ms Nel also believes the narrative is changing surrounding the typical sperm donor. Sperm donors in the UK generally need to be between the ages of 18 and 45. \"Maybe 20 years ago it was students but I think now it's a very healthy combination of people because infertility has become a more widely discussed topic and awareness has been increased around it,\" she said. \"I think the type of person that actually ends up becoming a donor is someone that is more aware of what they're doing, it's not your typical student just looking for an easy way to make money.\" The HFEA said UK sperm donors commonly visit a clinic \"once a week for between three and six months\". One of these visits will involve ejaculating into a sterilised cup and the sperm is then frozen and stored. It is not possible to donate anonymously and all donors are made aware that any child born can contact them once they turn 18.\n\nIf you have been a sperm donor or used donated sperm and would like to share your experiences please get in touch.",
    "Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy thinks an extended stint on the bench acted as motivation for Manchester United's two-goal Europa League hero Amad Diallo.\n\nAmad had been named as substitute in six successive games before being given a start against Greek side PAOK at Old Trafford.\n\nIn Van Nistelrooy\u2019s words, the 22-year-old responded by being \"our best player in the first half\", before \"winning us the game in the second\".\n\nAsked if being a substitute so often had been a motivating factor, Van Nistelrooy said: \"Apparently so.\"\n\nThe Ivory Coast international was by far United\u2019s biggest threat against limited opposition - he was prepared to run at the PAOK defence and carried on doing so, even when he did not get immediate reward.\n\nVan Nistelrooy accepted a first half in which United made \"many technical mistakes\" and had one shot on goal \"wasn't good\", but Amad made the difference after the interval.\n\n\"The second goal had everything in it that is Diallo,\" said Van Nistelrooy. \"He fought to win the ball off the defender, then pushed through to take the shot and had the quality to bend it around the goalkeeper.\n\n\"He is a great character and a hard worker. He shows that attitude in every training session. Every day in he comes to me and wants to do extra finishing, crossing, one v ones. He is asking how can I improve his shot, and his heading.\n\n\"He is constantly focused on learning and getting better. He is motivated to get the most from his career.\"\n\nAmad's present contract expires next June, although United do have the option to extend it by an additional year and he is keen to stay at the club for \"a long time\".\n\nNext week, he will have a new boss to impress as Ruben Amorim takes charge.\n\nVan Nistelrooy said he would have to \"check his phone\" to see if he had received a message from the Portuguese, although, for now, he seems happy both parties are concentrating on their current clubs.\n\n\"I think that Ruben focuses on [Sporting at] Braga and I focus on Leicester [in the Premier League on Sunday],\" the Dutchman said.",

    "Formula and equation sheets were originally going to stop being available for exams after 2024\n\nThe education secretary has said GCSE students should continue to be given formula and equation sheets to help in their exams. This year had been the final year students were expecting to receive that post-Covid support.

Ms Phillipson asked Ofqual to continue providing formula and equation sheets to maths, physics and combined-science students sitting their exams in 2025, 2026 and 2027. The exam aids were first introduced in 2022, to limit the impact of Covid-19 on learning.\n\nLast year, the previous, Conservative government said the exam aids would no longer be available to students from 2025 and pre-Covid exam arrangements would return.

In his response to Ms Phillipson, Sir Ian said it was important for teachers and students to have clarity on exam changes \"as soon as possible\". Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di\u2019Iasio said the move was one his union had \"long argued for\" and exams \"should not be a test of memory but of the ability of students to apply knowledge and learning\".

    "Ramez Abu Nasr managed to save his brother from the rubble\n\nWarning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and violence The hand was covered in dust, streaked with blood on the fingers and wrist, all that could be seen of the person who was killed. Like many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north. A teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive. But then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers. They leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men. In the narrow streets men dug with their hands. But there were no sounds coming from the rubble now. Whoever lay there was beyond help.\n\nThe Abu Nasr family were entombed by falling masonry after Israeli air strikes\n\nRamez Abu Nasr was digging for hours. His mother, father and brothers were entombed by the falling masonry. Ramez managed to save his youngest brother. The boy told him that he had heard his parents nearby, reciting the Shehada, the Muslim prayer of faith. Soon after they were silent. \u201cI took out my younger brother at the last moment. I don\u2019t know how we can go back to our home... without my mother, or father, or brothers,\u201d says Ramez. The family fled here from Jabalia when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began their renewed offensive against Hamas in the north twelve days ago. The IDF issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many thousands stayed behind, exhausted by constant displacement, fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies.\n\nInside a house that is still standing, a young man kneels in front of his dead sister. She looks to be in her thirties. \u201cOh God, my sister, my sister,\u201d he calls out. Civil Defence volunteers are gathering bodies from inside buildings. They find a badly wounded man and race to the ambulance. They are trying to save a life, but also are afraid of being bombed themselves. Ahmed al Kahlout from the local Civil Defence looked around him at the carnage. Behind him, a colleague tries to give CPR to a woman. It is hopeless. \"This is the al-Sayyed family house,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cThere are bodies, torn parts in this area... It is a horrible crime.\u201d Several ambulances are lined up in the streets. Most of those inside them are dead. Bodies are piled up. All ages. Blood seeps from the forehead of a small child. A woman, wrapped in a brightly coloured blanket is loaded beside her. Next to the ambulance a dead man, middle aged, is lying on a hospital trolley.\n\nMany of the casualties are taken to Jabalia\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital. It's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiyyah, told me by phone that his hospital faced a dire humanitarian crisis and accused Israel of imposing collective punishment. \"We urge the world to intervene and impose their humanity over the Israeli army, to open humanitarian corridors that allow the entrance of medical tools, delegations, fuel, and food so that we can provide humanitarian services for the children, newborn babies, and patients who are in need,\u201d he said. The United States has accused Israel of refusing or impeding up to 90% of aid to northern Gaza in the last month - and threatened to cut arms shipments unless there is change. Israel says it is taking American concerns seriously and is \u201caddressing the issue\". International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel. The IDF says it only targets \u201cterror cells\u201d and released a video of what it said was Hamas firing from within a clinic in Jabalia. The army also said they\u2019d found weapons and boobytraps in a medical facility. In the video an officer, his face blurred, points to booby traps and weapons and speaks to the camera: \u201cEverything here is a cynical exploitation of the civilian population, inside a clinic, inside a civilian compound. We will pursue these terrorists and find them in every corner.\u201d In Jabalia, a heavily pregnant woman is sitting in the dust outside a house. The Civil Defence workers arrive and help her onto a stretcher. Her father is there and tells her, \u201cYou are going to be ok. You are going to give birth, my heart.\u201d Then a shell explodes nearby. The small group rushes to the ambulance and escapes. Every day they plead for peace in Jabalia. For food, and medicine, for schools to open. They plead, but know their voices cannot make it stop. With additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen and Alice Doyard",

The Department for Business and Trade has asked management consultancy BCG to explore the possible ownership model, as first reported by Sky News. The business secretary expects to receive a report in the coming months, a government source said.\n\nSub-postmasters are responsible for the everyday management of more than 11,500 post offices across the UK. In July, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable told the Post Office inquiry that he had wanted to \u201caddress the imbalance\" between the Post Office and sub-postmasters by creating a \"mutual structure\u201d. He said he had raised some of these issues with the then Post Office boss Paula Vennells, but the change \"unfortunately never came to fruition\".

The relationship between the Post Office and the sub-postmasters has received widespread attention following the Horizon scandal. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts. It has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.

    "Rivals: Dame Jilly Cooper on why jogging is ruinous for our sex lives\n\nRivals is one of the year's best reviewed TV programmes, with a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"Would you like a large drink?\" A visit to Dame Jilly Cooper\u2019s house in the Cotswolds is everything you would hope it would be. It's just after midday, as displayed on the numerous clocks on the packed walls of her hall and living rooms. Almost every surface inch is taken up with art, family photos, framed cartoons or sporting memorabilia - including, rather unexpectedly, a signed Emile Heskey Liverpool shirt. Despite the relatively early hour, the writer of some of the best-selling novels of the 1980s is keen to share the contents of her drinks cabinet. She believes in providing old-school hospitality at the former 14th Century monks' dormitory she has called home for more than 40 years, and where she lived with her husband Leo until his death in 2013.\n\nDame Jilly Cooper, 87, in the living room of her house in the Cotswolds\n\nEarlier, on the way into her village, we drove past a jodhpur-clad gent on a horse, who gave us a roguish, charming smile. He could have ridden straight off the pages of one of her Rutshire Chronicles books. Her so-called \"bonkbusters\" - a term Dame Jilly does not like - were set in the world of the horse-owning, bed-swapping, countryside-residing upper classes. \"Low morals and high fences\" is how she rather perfectly sums up the books. With their mix of sex and scandal, they were publishing sensations. The second of the books, 1988's Rivals, has just been adapted into an eight-part Disney+ series with an all-star cast including Aidan Turner, David Tennant, Danny Dyer, Victoria Smurfit and Emily Atack.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, Rivals has become one of the year's best reviewed TV programmes. Lucy Mangan writing in the Guardian, external gave it five stars, saying \u201ceven the naked tennis scene is a triumph\". Camilla Long from The Times, external described it as: \u201cTwo fingers up to the puritans\u201d and \u201ca bra-off, knickers-down delight\u201d. The Financial Times, external called it \u201ca mash-up of Dynasty, Downton Abbey and the Carry On films\u201d which is \u201cpuerile, gratuitous and an absolute riot\u201d. While, even in the United States, The Chicago Tribune, external summed the show up as \u201cnot taking itself too seriously\" and \"all the better for it.\u201d Could this bonkbuster be Bafta bound?\n\nAidan Turner plays the 1980s TV presenter Declan O'Hara in the screen adaptation of Rivals\n\nDame Jilly served as an executive producer, which is why we have been invited to pay her a visit, although she does not want to claim credit for what she describes as an \"absolutely wonderful\" adaptation. \"How much of a say did I have? Not much,\" she laughs, explaining that her grandson Jago was a runner on the production, so when she went visited the set, she was better known as \"Jago's granny\". She suggested some changes, though. \"I did occasionally say, 'No, I don't think they should be jumping on each other quite so early in the story' and things like that.\"\n\nSet in the world of 1980s TV, Dame Jilly is relieved that the most outlandish sensibilities and plotlines of Rivals have not been toned down for a more sensitive 2024 audience. In the first episode, before even the opening credits, a pair of fully exposed male buttocks are on display during a \"mile-high\" sex scene on Concorde. \"That was not in the book,\" she nods approvingly. \"It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s quite naughty too.\" She pauses, before adding: \"There is a lot of sex. In one episode they have every member of the cast coupled and fornicating for the next 20 minutes and all of that.\" Dame Jilly sounds rather shocked by what she saw. \"Well, 87 is very old and you do forget about sex,\" she offers by way of explanation. When I ask her what in life makes her blush, she gives a rather surprising answer. \"Books I wrote in the old days. Because I'm amazed at some of the things I wrote about. They are quite strong.\"\n\nIt turns out that she is currently in the middle of re-reading Rivals to swot up ahead of more interviews about the show. \"Lots and lots and lots of sex,\" is her review. \"The 80s really were the most fun time,\" she muses. \"Masses of sex, masses of drinking, masses of parties. The younger generation all wish they had been born then.\" However, she's quick to point out that one of the most non-MeToo-friendly aspects of the TV series, when an uninvited bum grope is used as a replacement for a chat-up line, wasn't in the print version.\n\nThere are many aspects of the 1980s for which she is nostalgic, in particular what she perceives as a major change in the dynamics of relationships. \"I think women are much tougher, much stronger and much more forthright. And I think men are much, much less macho. I mean, macho has gone. You are not allowed to be macho. \"Women are stronger and men are weaker, therefore there is not so much sexual desire between them,\" is her summation. She also believes there is another contributing factor to a decline in modern love lives. \"Everybody jogs. They get up in the morning, they jog all around the countryside for hours. They do exercises. That\u2019s what they do now. They don't have sex any more. They are far too tired to have sex now. Jogging is bad for people's love life. Ruinous.\" Back in the 1980s, the idea of Jilly Cooper teaming up with Disney would have seemed as likely as Rivals being chosen for Jackanory. There is no doubt that she's thrilled by the collaboration.\n\nDame Jilly Cooper was made a Dame by King Charles in May\n\nIn previous adaptations of her work, Dame Jilly was not happy with the casting of \"the handsomest man in England\" Rupert Campbell-Black, the fictional former Olympian and future Conservative MP, notorious for his conquests in the boardroom and the bedroom. This time, the part has gone to the English actor Alex Hassell, who starred in His Dark Materials. In Rivals, he is seen without any material at all, courtesy of a nude tennis scene. \"They interviewed 600 people for that one,\" reveals Dame Jilly, who was delighted with the final choice, despite some obvious differences to her literary creation. \"He's very handsome. Rupert's blond-haired and blue-eyed in the book, but he's become dark and dark-eyed. But he\u2019s very sexy.\"\n\nFurther details about her main character are explained during a walk with Dame Jilly through her large garden, as she points out the view over a valley, which inspired the literary location of his mansion. She also guides us to small two-storey outbuilding, gently announcing: \"I wrote Rivals in there. Above a room with all the garden tools. It was very quiet.\" The only hard part about interviewing Dame Jilly is trying to stop her continually asking her own questions, such is her enthusiasm and interest in every aspect of life. She reveals that until Rivals she had never heard of Danny Dyer (\"he's lovely, quite shy\"), the aspect of modern life which most frustrates her is inheritance tax, and she is not a fan of the concept of internet dating (\"awful\").\n\nDame Jilly Cooper pictured at the premiere of Rivals earlier this month\n\nShe also enjoyed looking back at a busy year, which has included having a damehood bestowed on her by King Charles. It turns out he used the occasion to pass on some betting tips. \"He laughed and said, 'By the way, if you are going to Ascot, we\u2019ve got some rather good horses'.\" There was also an invitation to Downing Street by the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who had revealed himself to be a fan of her books. \"He was lovely,\" she enthuses. \"The King. A prime minister. I\u2019ve got about a bit,\" she giggles. \"There was me saying I never meet men any more.\" One thing she will not be doing is writing anymore Rutshire Chronicles: \"No, I think Rupert\u2019s old enough now.\" However, this TV version of Rivals, only goes up to halfway through the novel, so if successful, the plan would be more seasons. \"I hope so, yes,\" she beams. \"That would keep us all very happy for the next few years.\" We are invited to take a seat at the kitchen table, followed by an offer of cakes and more suggestions of stiff drinks. When I ask if a cup of tea could be an alternative, a look combining disappointment, disapproval and pity comes over her face. Once again, modern man has let Dame Jilly Cooper down. Rivals is on Disney+ from 18 October.\n\u2022 None Jilly Cooper on damehood and 'Dishy Rishi' being a fan. Video, 00:00:46Jilly Cooper on damehood and 'Dishy Rishi' being a fan",
    "Elon Musk is seen during the final match of the 2024 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York\n\nUS regulators and representatives of Elon Musk have remained tight-lipped over whether the billionaire attended an interview on Thursday about his takeover of Twitter - now called X, as required by a federal court. Last month, he was a no-show for a court ordered appearance at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) office in Los Angeles. However, Mr Musk fell unusually quiet on X not posting for several hours on Thursday morning, and on Friday wrote a post indicating he had visited Los Angeles. The SEC is investigating whether Mr Musk waited too long to disclose he was building up a stake in Twitter before his 2022 takeover - a delay he has previously described as a mistake.\n\nThe nation's top securities regulator had called for possible sanctions, if Mr Musk failed to attend. For the 10 September court hearing, the SEC said it spent thousands of dollars to dispatch three lawyers - two from San Francisco and another from Washington DC -so they could take a sworn deposition from the billionaire tech mogul. But three hours before the appointment, Mr Musk's lawyers notified the SEC that he would not be able to appear. Mr Musk, his lawyers wrote in a declaration, had urgently travelled to the East Coast a day earlier for a \"high-risk\" launch by his rocket company SpaceX. But SpaceX had posted about the timing of the scheduled launch two days before Mr Musk's deposition date. And a day ahead of the meeting, he told interviewers at a conference that he planned to travel to Florida \"if the weather is holding up\" for the launch. The SEC says he did not inform them of those plans. The government lawyers only learned of the post and interview later. They rescheduled the suddenly cancelled meeting and then they asked a federal court to make sure Mr Musk appeared. Mr Musk has given two depositions since the SEC began looking into his $44bn (\u00a334bn) purchase of Twitter in 2022. The agency has said in legal filings that it is probing whether his stock purchases before he bought the company outright and statements he made about those investments broke securities laws. But Mr Musk refused to give testimony a third time, with his lawyers sending a letter to the SEC accusing it of harassment. In October, the SEC asked a court to order him to provide more testimony. Mr Musk's reason for missing last month's appointment \"smacks of gamesmanship,\" SEC lawyers wrote in a 20 September filing. They asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to impose a penalty on him if he skipped the next meeting, arguing it was needed to deter him from \"failing to show up\" on Thursday. Mr Musk was supposed to seek written consent from the SEC or an order from the court to reschedule, they added. Replying in his own filing, his lawyer Alex Spiro of the law firm Quinn Emanuel, said his client and his companies have cooperated with the SEC in this investigation and several others. \"In this investigation alone, Mr Musk has produced hundreds of documents, he has sat for testimony twice, his wealth manager has sat for testimony three times, and other individuals connected to Mr Musk have also sat for testimony, all without rescheduling or cancelling any of those testimonies,\" Mr Spiro wrote. Mr Musk's lawyers say they too had travelled to Los Angeles to be at his deposition last month and \"immediately notified the SEC of the emergency\". The SEC declined to comment when approached by the BBC. But in a court filing, SEC lawyer Robin Andrews asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to take a hard line against the billionaire. \"The Court must make clear that gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,\" Mr Andrews wrote.",

At the time, Tyson apologised for her \"past actions\", but said her behaviour never \"extended beyond bad edgy jokes\" and denied ever grooming anyone. The alleged victim - who was named online - also defended her, saying the claims were \"massive lies\" and that they had never been \"exploited or taken advantage of\".\n\nMrBeast, 26, real name Jimmy Donaldson, hosts the largest channel on YouTube, with 325m subscribers, and is known for making videos of stunts, challenges and acts of philanthropy. Tyson, 28, who last year came out as transgender, has appeared regularly on the channel since it was launched in 2012. After the initial claims in July, MrBeast said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the \"serious allegations of Ava Tyson's behaviour online\" and \"opposed to such unacceptable acts\". On Friday, he shared a letter on X from Quinn Emanuel Urqhart & Sullivan LLP, the law firm he hired to conduct an investigation into the claims. The letter said the firm had conducted 39 interviews with current and former employees of MrBeast's company and reviewed over 4.5m documents collected from mobile phones, e-mails, and a variety of messaging platforms. \"Allegations of sexual misconduct... between company employees and minors are without basis. The allegations were soundly rejected, including by alleged victims,\" it said. It added that allegations the company had knowingly employed \"individuals with proclivities or histories towards illegal... conduct\" were \"similarly without basis\". The letter said some \"isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct were identified\" and that, once informed about them, the company had taken \"swift and appropriate actions\". Following the publication of the letter, the alleged victim of Tyson's behaviour said again that the claims were \"completely false\". \"People used my name to make very serious allegations and claims without ever speaking to me,\" they said. \"It was incredibly difficult having my name thrown around in a public forum without being given the opportunity to share the truth. \"The private investigators reviewed all my [direct messages] and interactions with Kris. \"I was not groomed. These were false allegations made up by other people with my name thrown in them.\"\n\nResponding to the initial allegations in July, Tyson apologised for her \"unacceptable social media posts, past actions, and to those who may feel betrayed by how I used to act online\", but added: \"I never groomed anyone\". \"To lump these two factors together to create a narrative that my behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen,\" she said. \"I have learned that my old humor is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself.\"",
    "The firm said its commercial online operations, including its large language AI models, were unaffected\n\nTikTok owner, ByteDance, says it has sacked an intern for \"maliciously interfering\" with the training of one of its artificial intelligence (AI) models. But the firm rejected claims about the extent of the damage caused by the unnamed individual, saying they \"contain some exaggerations and inaccuracies\". It comes after reports about the incident spread over the weekend on social media. The Chinese technology giant's Doubao ChatGPT-like generative AI model is the country's most popular AI chatbot.\n\n\"The individual was an intern with the [advertising] technology team and has no experience with the AI Lab,\" ByteDance said in a statement. \"Their social media profile and some media reports contain inaccuracies.\" Its commercial online operations, including its large language AI models, were unaffected by the intern's actions, the company added. ByteDance also denied reports that the incident caused more than $10m (\u00a37.7m) of damage by disrupting an AI training system made up of thousands of powerful graphics processing units (GPU). As well as firing the person in August, ByteDance said it had informed the intern's university and industry bodies about the incident. ByteDance operates some of the world's most popular social media apps, including TikTok and its Chinese-equivalent Douyin. It is widely seen as a leader when it comes to algorithm development due to how appealing its apps are to users. Like many of its peers in China and around the world, the social media giant is investing heavily in AI. It uses the technology to power its Doubao chatbot as well as many other applications, including a text-to-video tool called Jimeng.",
    "Men buy more from Lidl middle aisle, says boss\n\nMen are buying more from Lidl\u2019s middle aisle, its UK boss has said as the supermarket returned to profit after a loss-making year. Ryan McDonnell said the middle of Lidl, known for its unusual stock which ranges from power tools to inflatables, had a \u201cbig male following\u201d. \"We often get partners at odds with each other because men have disappeared up the aisle and are buying things they maybe already have,\" he told the BBC. His comments came as Lidl reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a343m, compared with a loss of \u00a376m the previous year.\n\nIt saw a 16.9% jump in annual sales for the year to the end of February 2024 with sales of nearly \u00a311bn. It\u2019s 30 years this month since Lidl arrived in the UK. It now has more than 960 shops and is the nation's sixth biggest grocer. Mr McDonnell has been with the firm for most of it and remembers the early no frills stores packed with unfamiliar products. \u201cI remember selling pallets of more continental products. We\u2019ve come a long way, evolving our ranges,\" he said. One of its quirks is \"the middle of Lidl\" and a trip to the retailer has become synonymous with shoppers returning with something they had not gone in for.\n\n\"There are some interesting shopping habits in this aisle,\" he said, adding he had known rows between couples after a man had become \"intrigued by a gadget or two\". \"I would say there are a lot of men in trouble when they come in here,\" he said. There are Facebook pages, Reddit threads and YouTube videos dedicated to middle-aisle finds. \"My mum came back with a two-man canoe despite not living near any suitable body of water,\" one Reddit user posted on a thread about things people had found. \"A flamethrower,\" another user posted. \"It was for getting rid of weeds.\" Aside from the middle aisle, Mr McDonnell said there had been a lot of early spend on mince pies, party food and panettone. He said Lidl had won a lot of new customers and many were in a \u201cconfident mood\" for Christmas despite the tough economic backdrop. Lidl has been freshening up the look of its stores, putting bakeries at the entrances and displaying more fruit and veg. Both categories have seen a jump in sales. Amid cutthroat competition and price matching, Mr McDonnell believes the shopping experience is just as important as the price to keep pulling customers in.\n\nLidl UK boss Ryan McDonnell said changes announced in the Budget would add tens of millions to the retailer's costs\n\nLidl is the fastest-growing supermarket chain in the UK this year but, like other retailers, it is now having to deal with the impact of the Budget. Supermarkets employ large numbers of people and profit margins are slim. Mr McDonnell warned tax rises announced in the Budget would add tens of millions of pounds to its costs in the coming year. The bosses of Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks & Spencer have both warned shoppers could face higher prices as a result of an increase in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs). On Tuesday, Lidl joined dozens of High Street giants in signing a letter to the Treasury warning job losses were \"inevitable\" and price rises \"a certainty\" as a result of measures announced in the Budget and other rising costs. The Treasury told the BBC the government \"had to make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\".\n\nMr McDonnell declined to put an exact figure on the extra cost of NICs, but said it was just one of a number of new costs coming down the track creating a cumulative burden for the industry. \u201cWe're talking about National Insurance, National Living Wage, we're talking about business rates. We have packaging and recycling taxes coming in. That's a lot of pressure on business all at once,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the government needs to review how they intend to inspire growth.\" However, he insisted Lidl\u2019s investment plans in the UK would not change, with 18 more stores due to open in the next few months followed by 40 in the next financial year.\n\nDo you buy things you didn't plan to when you go to the supermarket?

    "Mr Gilliver has been shortlisted in the British Photography Awards for his image\n\nIf you have ever written your name in the air with a sparkler on bonfire night then you have experimented with light painting. Baffled by the \u201clines of light floating in mid-air\u201d, Scottish photographer David Gilliver knew he had to try capturing them with his camera. \"I thought it was like sorcery, it's like magic,\u201d he says. For 15 years, Mr Gilliver has been a pioneer in the technique of light painting. Now, one of his pictures - which he has called Where Rainbows Sleep - has been shortlisted for this year\u2019s British Photography Awards, external in its newest category - best low light photograph.\n\nPicture this: Mr Gilliver is stood in a pitch black fishing boat hut, dressed head to toe in dark clothing, holding a \u201clight sabre\u201d. No, he's not re-enacting Star Wars - this is just how the process of making the photo begins. To blend into the low-light background, Mr Gilliver must imitate one of film\u2019s greatest villains. He channels his inner Darth Vader but instead of \"the force\" he uses a long exposure photography technique, keeping the shutter open for anything from 30 seconds to 20 minutes. His camera, which he controls remotely, is at the other end of the room securely fixed to a tripod, because even the slightest movement will cause a blurring of the image. Mr Gilliver moves towards the camera, swooshing his light sabre before disappearing down the trap door. The exposure length gives him enough time to fire a flash gun manually to illuminate the boat hut surroundings.\n\nThe photographer immerses himself in the creative escapism of light painting\n\n\"Simple is often best\", Mr Gilliver says, when it comes to creating his waves of light. But he also loves to experiment. In another photo, he uses butterfly keyrings with battery-operated lights to create an image of multiple floating butterflies. He also created an eerie orb sitting within the ancient Callanish stones on the Isle of Lewis, by swinging a light on the end of a string like a lasso during the long exposure time.\n\nThe 45-year-old Glasgow School of Art graduate has always had an artistic eye. However, making a living as an artist initially proved difficult and he ended up working in finance in the Channel Islands for 14 years. He became \"utterly obsessed\" with light painting to capture the \"magical\" landscapes of Guernsey at night. When he moved back to Scotland in 2015, he says the \"dramatic\" and \"iconic\" backdrops of the country kept his creativity alive. In 2018, he abandoned his 9 to 5 life to finally take up photography full time.\n\nDavid Gilliver uses the moonlight to illuminate the dark backgrounds\n\nWhen he started posting his light paintings online, he says most people would ask him how he did it. Photographers would ask to come with him while he created his images, he says. Mr Gilliver, who lives in Gartcosh, North Lanarkshire, now teaches his own workshops across the UK. He says most people think the technique is hard to understand but actually it is \"very accessible\" once people start to experiment and play with light. He says teaching \"found\" him and he enjoys people's natural curiosity. \"Watching their eyes light up as they begin to learn what the creative possibilities are of this amazing art form is one of the many joys of teaching,\" he says.\n\nLoch Lomond is one of Mr Gilliver's favourite places to teach\n\nAlong with light painting, Mr Gilliver has a large portfolio of macro photography. The technique is a form of extreme close-up photography and can be used to capture small objects, flowers and insects. Mr Gilliver plays around with imaginative scenarios using small figurines. His photos range from iconic film scenes to handling more serious topics.\n\nThis year, his recreation of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's famous \"I'm flying\" scene from the blockbuster movie Titanic has been shortlisted in the macro category. It depicts a miniature Jack and Rose recreating the famous scene on top of an electric iron.\n\nDavid Gilliver won at the British Photography Awards last year\n\nHe is no stranger to the British Photography Awards, having already won the best macro photograph category in 2022 by turning a face mask into a swimming pool for a Covid pandemic image. \"Delivering a serious message without trivialising what you're talking about is the key,\" he says.\n\nThe photographer says it would be unfair to choose which of photographic forms he prefers. He says macro photography exercises his imagination but light painting feels more like an experience. The \"experiential\" side of light painting is what makes the \"incredible process reign supreme\", he says. Mr Gilliver has been shortlisted for three categories in this year's British Photography Awards, for best macro, low light and commercial photography. The awards will take place on 4 November.",
    "Nadia Ayoub McCulloch has been separated from her family when trying to leave Lebanon\n\nA Scottish family evacuated from Lebanon have spoken of their anger after their non-British mother was blocked from boarding the flight with two of her children. Nadia Ayoub McCulloch, 51, and her children Thomas, 19, and Rebecca, 16, attempted to fly out from Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport to Birmingham due to the ongoing conflict with Israel which has seen the city bombed. However, Ms McCulloch was turned away by officials as she does not have a UK passport or visa, meaning only her children were allowed to leave. Her Scottish husband of 20 years, William McCulloch, 62, now intends to travel back to Lebanon from Iraq in the hope he can reunite with his wife and leave the country together.\n\nHe said: \"I just don't understand it. We paid for the three seats, she went to the airport, and she was told that she can't get on the flight because she didn't have a visa. \"Rebecca organised everything and she may have been told before she left the house (that Ms McCulloch would be unable to board the flight), but she thought she would just go and try because she wanted to go with the kids, but she was told categorically, no.\"\n\nAs of last month, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals including dependants, in Lebanon. More than 250 UK citizens have already left on chartered flights. As of Friday morning, more than 2,000 British nationals had registered their presence in the country, the Foreign Office said. The UK government is chartering another flight for Britons to leave on Sunday, the fourth such flight organised since the escalation of the conflict in Lebanon. The Foreign Office said it did not normally comment on individual cases. The general advice is that spouses of British nationals are eligible to leave on the specially chartered flights but if they are not UK citizens, they must have a valid visa to stay in the UK for more than six months. , external A government spokesman said: \"We understand this is a worrying time for many. The safety of British nationals in Lebanon is our top priority and we urge everyone to continue to follow our travel advice. \"All non-British nationals requiring a visa will need to make an online visa application and submit their biometrics at a Visa Application Centre, prior to travel to the UK.\"\n\nWilliam McCulloch intends to travel back to Lebanon to help his wife leave\n\nMr McCulloch, who has lived in Lebanon since 2002, said the couple were evacuated with Thomas during the 2006 Lebanon war and had \"no problem whatsoever\" on that occasion. Mr McCulloch works with humanitarian organisation Norwegian People's Aid and is currently working to clear unexploded ordnance in Iraq. He will fly back to Beirut later in October, despite the continuing conflict. He added: \"I have no problems going back into Beirut - if something happens, something happens, but 100% I'm going back to my wife.\"\n\nHis son David Hardie, 36, who lives in Carluke, said it was a \"a lot of weight\" off his shoulders to have his siblings back in Scotland. He said: \"Even when they announced the flight, there was nothing about a ceasefire or how they were going to get to the airport or anything... that was scary for them, because you don't know when the next bomb is going to hit\". Mr Hardie said he was \"angry\" over the visa situation. He added: \"They've been married for over 20 years - it's not like they've been married for two or three years, they've been married 20 years, and she can't even get evacuated from a war.\"\n\nNadia Ayoub McCullough and Thomas, then a young child, left Lebanon during the 2006 conflict\n\nMr Hardie also criticised the cost of the UK government flights out of Lebanon, which were \u00a3350 per person. He said the cost was a \"low blow\". Mr Hardie added: \"We're not poor or anything but I still feel like, if you've been evacuated from a war-torn country, there should have been more help. \"I think that was a surprise. Like, you get a text message, you click a link, you go in, you sign your name, your passport number, and then at the end, it asks you for \u00a3350. \"There might have been families over there who couldn't afford that.\" The last week has seen a significant escalation of the crisis in the Middle East, with warning that it could develop into a all-out regional war. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel.",

It was brought down on top of him and his family last night by an Israeli airstrike, that killed at 18 people, four of them children, according to Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry. The attack happened without warning in a place where people thought they would be safe \u2013 about 150 metres from the entrance to Lebanon\u2019s largest public hospital, the Rafik Hariri hospital in southern Beirut. Mohammed and his family were asleep in their beds. \u201cWe didn't recognise what is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the strike we hear the sound like \u2018boom, boom, boom, boom\u2019 like this. And everything is thrown on us. Stones, metal, steel, fresh blood, fresh meat on us. You couldn't speak, you couldn't breathe, you couldn't take your oxygen.\u201d He names five neighbours who are still under the rubble of their home. And there were others, killed in an instant, in their own neighbourhood \u2013 including two 19-year-old girls who were sitting outside his door. Mohammed, 54, survived with a grazed arm, but his 20-year-old nephew is now in intensive care. \u201cHalf of his brain is crushed,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 None Lebanon says 18 killed in Israeli strike near southern Beirut hospital\n\u2022 None Biden 'deeply concerned' about apparent leak of Israel plan to attack Iran A civil defence worker at the scene told us six residential buildings had been brought down, most of them three or four stories high. A veiled woman sat on the ground, with her hands on her head, rocking back and forth in distress. \u201cThere are no Hezbollah here,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are all civilians\u201d. A neighbour said, \u201ceveryone flew through the air\u201d. Minutes later more remains were recovered from the rubble and carried away in a black body bag. I asked Mohammed what he thought Israel could have been targeting, in this heavily populated area. \u201cThey are hitting everything randomly,\u201d he replied, his voice strengthened by anger. \u201cWithout seeing there is children. Where are the guns here? Where are the rockets here? Blind, Israeli enemies. Blind.\u201d\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it struck a \"Hezbollah terrorist target near the hospital\u201d without providing any information about what the target was. It says the hospital itself was not targeted or hit. Rafik Hariri hospital director Jihad Saadeh said it was struck by shrapnel but is functioning normally and will not be evacuated. Not so for the Al Sahel private hospital, about 2km away, which was emptied out last night. \u201cWe evacuated instantly, like crazy,\u201d says Dr Mazen Alameh, the general manager. \u201cWe cannot risk anyone's lives. We cannot take it as granted that they (Israel) will not bomb.\u201d The hurried evacuation of 10 patients and 50 staff came after a public claim by the Israeli military that the hospital was sitting on top of a Hezbollah bunker, full of riches. The IDF gave no proof but produced a 3D animation, claiming to show a bunker beneath the building. \u201cThere are hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold inside the bunker, right now,\u201d said the IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. It sounded like an invitation to a heist.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The hospital is in the southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, but staff insist strongly that it is not linked with any group. \u201cIt's really shocking to say that Sahel Hospital is affiliated with any party in Lebanon,\u201d says Dr Alameh. \u201cIt's a private hospital. It's a teaching hospital for doctors, physicians and other medical students.\" He dismissed Israel\u2019s claim of a hidden bunker. \u201cThe hospital was founded 40 years ago on an old house,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have any tunnel or infrastructure underneath. Any person in the world can come here and see everything they want.\u201d We were encouraged to check in every corner. Nowhere was off limits, not even the morgue. Bundles of surgical scrubs, and packets of surgical instruments were opened to show there was nothing concealed. After the tour, we were allowed to move around freely. We saw empty wards and anxious staff, but no hint of a bunker. Israel claimed the entrance was in a neighbouring building. We went there too and had free access to the parking lot underneath. If there was an entrance to a secret bunker, we did not find it. The only door we saw led to a lift, which we could not open.

As it was underway, the IDF issued a warning, telling residents of two nearby buildings to leave as they were \u201clocated near Hezbollah facilities.\u201d Half an hour later two more multi story buildings vanished from the skyline in seconds, reduced to dark clouds of smoke and ash.

    "Moldova says 'Yes' to pro-EU constitutional changes by tiny margin\n\nTurnout in the two votes stood at more than 50%\n\nPeople in Moldova have backed the Eastern European country's proposed changes to its constitution and commitment to joining the EU by the thinnest of margins in a referendum. Official data put Yes on 50.46% and No on 49.54% on Monday afternoon, with more than 99.6% of votes counted. The knife-edge nature of the vote has come as a shock to many. The referendum had been widely expected to comfortably pass in the country of 2.6 million, which borders Romania and Ukraine. The vote was combined with presidential elections in which Maia Sandu, the incumbent pro-EU president, failed to win re-election outright and faces a second round next month.\n\nResponding to the referendum result, she said pro-EU forces had won the first battle in a \"difficult fight\", which she also called \"unjust\". She accused those she called Moldova\u2019s \"enemies\" - and criminal groups \u2013 of trying to buy votes and said it was a dangerous phenomenon for any democracy. On Sunday, Sandu had denounced the narrow result as the product of foreign interference in Moldovan politics and said Moldova had suffered an \"unprecedented assault on democracy\". On neither occasion did she refer to Russia explicitly, but in recent weeks Moldovan authorities uncovered a giant scheme of payments coming from Moscow \u2013 and paid to people to vote against her and the EU referendum. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Sandu would need to present \"evidence\" for her claims that there had been foreign interference in the vote. EU spokesperson Peter Stano said on Monday that the vote had taken place \"under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies\". Last month Ilan Shor, a pro-Russian Moldovan businessman and politician who now lives in Russia, said he would pay money to convince \u201cas many people as possible\u201d to vote No or to abstain in the EU referendum. This week, Shor then made a video statement telling people to vote for \"anyone but Sandu\" in the presidential election. On Sunday, the BBC stumbled upon evidence of vote-buying at a polling station for residents of the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria - which is economically, politically and militarily supported by Russia. A BBC producer heard a woman who had just dropped her ballot in the transparent box ask an election monitor where she would get paid. When we asked directly whether she had been offered cash to vote, she admitted it without qualms. She was angry that a man who had sent her to the polling station was no longer answering her calls. \u201cHe tricked me!\u201d she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nShe would not reply when asked who she had voted for. As well as the referendum on changing the constitution, Moldovans also voted in the country's presidential election on Sunday. The votes were seen as key tests for the country, which is facing a choice between pushing on with EU membership or keeping close ties to Russia. Sandu topped the election first round with 41% of the vote versus her closest opponent's 26%. The result for Aleksandr Stoianoglo, who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, was considerably higher than expected. Sandu will now face a difficult second round on 3 November in which her eliminated rivals - populist Renato Usatii and former Gagauzia governor Irina Vlah - will likely unite against her behind Stoianoglo.\n\nMaia Sandu arrives to give a press briefing in Chisinau, following a disappointing result for her\n\nShe accused \"criminal groups\" of working together with \"foreign forces\", using money, lies, and propaganda to sway the vote. Sandu also said her government had \"clear evidence\" that 300,000 votes were bought, which she called \"a fraud of unprecedented scale\". Moldova is currently in talks with the EU on becoming a member. These accession talks will continue despite Sunday\u2019s outcome, as the referendum was not legally binding. The vote, however, was supposed to make the process irreversible. Instead, it feels a little shakier now.\n\nAt Sandu's election headquarters on Sunday evening, the mood was extremely subdued, with one of her advisers describing the result so far as \"not what we expected\". Sandu, who has cultivated close ties with Moldova\u2019s EU neighbours, had campaigned for the Yes vote in the referendum. She had previously said the vote was would set up the future of Moldova for \"many decades ahead\". When the first results began trickling in showing that the No vote had done better than expected, Sandu\u2019s team put the disappointing results down to the first count coming in from villages and rural areas. The big city count narrowed the lead for the No vote, but by 01:00 (22:00 GMT) few thought the Yes camp could still stand a chance. Many of Sandu\u2019s supporters left her headquarters in Chisinau where they had been hoping to celebrate her victory before the count was even over. The little EU flags they\u2019d been given to wave were abandoned, on chairs or strewn on the ground. But as the night went on, the gap narrowed even further. In the end, the Yes vote clinched it - but only just. Voter turnout stood at more than 51% when polls closed at 21:00 local time (18:00 GMT), making the referendum valid. Several presidential candidates boycotted the referendum. Aleksandr Stoianoglo said he did not support the idea of changing the constitution - although he added he was a supporter of his country's \"European aspirations\". However, many young people queuing at polling stations on Sunday were vocal about their support for Moldova\u2019s future as an EU member state, with some saying they were voting because they wanted to choose a European future for their country \u2013 for the sake of the economy and for more opportunities. Some said they were fed up of being \"pulled\" towards Moscow, decades after the Soviet Union collapsed and Moldova became independent. \"We have to choose a European future for our country, for our children, our future \u2013 for geopolitics, for peace, that\u2019s the most important,\" a voter called Oksana told the BBC. \"Because we are between Europe and Russian influence, and we have to choose what we want.\"",
    "England have a 'point to prove' in pivotal SA series\n\nIn October, England failed to reach the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup for the first time since 2010\n\nWhether England want to admit it or not, they have a point to prove. Just over a month after their disastrous group-stage exit from the Women's T20 World Cup, Heather Knight's side are in South Africa for a multi-format series, which is followed by the Women's Ashes in Australia in January. The first of three T20s starts on Sunday (12:00 GMT), followed by three one-day internationals and then a four-day Test begins on 15 December. You can ball-by-ball radio commentary on every game on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text updates. It is a quick turnaround from such a disappointing World Cup campaign but seamer Kate Cross, who is in the ODI and Test squads, feels that will benefit England. \"Years ago, if you were knocked out of a World Cup, you had to wait until your summer to play cricket again and prove yourself,\" Cross told BBC's No Balls podcast. \"But I feel like cricket has been back on our horizon so quickly after that, against the team who lost the final, so we know we've got a chance to measure ourselves against a really strong team in their own conditions and you're back in the fight straight away.\" The fallout from the World Cup was possibly the harshest that an England women's side has faced, a stark reminder of the increased scrutiny and expectation that comes with the privilege of being a professional athlete. The team's fitness was questioned, alongside their off-field activities and social media presence. Knight and head coach Jon Lewis rejected the accusations and understandably defended their team, but acknowledged their need to improve in pressure moments - though that is something they have been saying for almost two years. Against South Africa, finalists of said World Cup, England have a chance to change these perceptions before entering the Ashes pressure cooker.\n\nLewis and Knight have put faith in their group, too. Top-order batter Alice Capsey was initially dropped from the World Cup squad for the T20 leg of the tour, but has since been recalled after an injury to all-rounder Paige Scholfield, while Danielle Gibson is the only other omission because of a knee problem. Fast bowler Lauren Filer comes into all three squads as a particularly exciting prospect for the Ashes. South Africa have rested star all-rounder Marizanne Kapp and seamer Ayabonga Khaka for the T20 series, but both will likely return for the ODIs and the Test. Lewis has acknowledged the difficulty in replicating high-pressure situations outside of matches, and going into the World Cup his side had barely been challenged in a relatively low-key summer which involved dominant series wins over Pakistan and New Zealand, who eventually won the tournament. But the intense two months ahead should not be lacking in pressure: South Africa will also have fire in the belly after losing the T20 final, while facing the game's dominant force, Australia, in their own backyard is one of cricket's greatest tasks. It will not be easy, considering the significant amount of time they will be spending away from home and against two high-quality teams. But it is a golden opportunity for England to silence critics and regain the form and excitement at the heart of their brand of cricket in 2023, the high-profile summer which saw both England men and women gripped in enthralling Ashes contests.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",
    "Rust premieres at low-key film festival three years after shooting\n\nThe film premiered on Wednesday in Torun, central Poland\n\nThe western Rust has premiered in Poland, three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was accidentally shot and killed on set in New Mexico. Organisers of Poland\u2019s Camerimage International Film Festival said the screening was a tribute to the 42-year-old Ukrainian-born cinematographer, who was a fan of the event and had attended in the past. The movie\u2019s star Alec Baldwin was not invited and did not attend the premiere. Writer and director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, told the BBC at the premiere that at one point he \"couldn\u2019t even conceive of ever being back on the set ever again, it just hurt too much\".\n\nHe said he changed his mind and decided to complete the film after speaking to Hutchins' husband, Matt. But the announcement that Camerimage in the northern Polish city of Torun was going to give the movie its international debut has been criticised by some prominent cinematographers in Hollywood for being disrespectful to Hutchins' memory. Hutchins\u2019 mother, Olga Solovey, who is suing the production and Alec Baldwin in a civil action, didn\u2019t attend either. In a statement issued by her lawyer she said she regards the premiere as an attempt to profit from her daughter\u2019s death. \u201cAlec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople queue for the screening, which wasn't completely full\n\nIn October 2021, Baldwin was rehearsing a scene on set with a gun, which was supposed to be loaded with dummy rounds, when the weapon fired a live round, killing Hutchins and wounding Souza. In July, a judge dismissed an involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin after police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defence. In March, the armourer on the film set, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and is serving an 18-month prison sentence. Prosecutors said she failed to notice that live bullets had mixed with dummy rounds in a box of ammunition on set. She has appealed against the verdict.\n\u2022 None How events unfolded after fatal shooting on Alec Baldwin film set Set in 1882 in Wyoming, Rust tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is sentenced to be hanged after he accidentally kills a rancher. He goes on the run with his grandfather, Baldwin\u2019s Harlan Rust.\n\nSouza, who attended the premiere with Bianca Cline who replaced Hutchins as the film\u2019s cinematographer, refused several requests to complete the film after the tragic shooting, said Hutchins' husband, Matt, convinced him to complete the film, which is dedicated to her. \"At first I didn\u2019t really know if I wanted to do this to be honest, but as I found out that this is what Matt wanted, this is what the family wanted, it started to change the equation for me,\" he told the BBC. \"It was going to be more about honouring her legacy and her memory, saying that her final work was completed and that began to change my mind on things,\" he added. Both he and Cline acknowledged that many in the industry were uncomfortable with his decision. \u201cEverybody\u2019s angry, we\u2019re angry as well. It\u2019s something tragic and it\u2019s hard to deal with. Some people think it\u2019s better to deal with that through not participating and other people think it\u2019s honourable like we do. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any right or wrong answer to this,\u201d Cline told the BBC.\n\nCinematographer Bianca Cline with the film's writer and director Joel Souza, centre\n\nBefore the screening, Rachel Mason, a close friend of Hutchins who filmed a documentary about the making of Rust, recalled how difficult it was to complete the movie with all the controversy surrounding it. She said some crew members told her not to film them on the closed set, in case, she said, it was discovered they had worked on Rust \"and I might never get a job again\". Crew came back to finish the filming after they realised it might help Hutchins' family. \"She had this amazing gift of becoming friends very, very fast with people. And they all fell in love with her,\" she said. Ms Mason also recounted a conversation with Hutchins' mother 18 months ago during which she told her she wanted the film to be completed because it was her daughter\u2019s \"big work\". Rust depicts the manhunt for grandfather and grandson amidst a backdrop of snow-capped mountains and tumbleweed dirt towns. It knowingly acknowledges classic westerns including John Ford\u2019s \u2018The Searchers\u2019 and Sergio Leone\u2019s \u2018The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u2019. Souza was very close to his own grandfather, who, he said, loved westerns. Several people I spoke to after the screening enjoyed the movie with Jan, a film colourist from Warsaw calling it \"a classic western\". Leonora, a cinematographer from Belarus said it was brilliant and she had cried all the way through Ms Mason\u2019s speech.\n\nHalyna Hutchins' friend Rachel Mason also spoke to the audience\n\nOne viewer noted the many gunfight scenes involving Alec Baldwin could be distracting. \u201cAll the time as I was thinking about it, especially during the gunfight scenes, it was hard not to get pulled back out of the movie, especially when Alec Baldwin\u2019s holding a gun, but most of the time it was just a really, really enjoyable experience,\u201d Maciej from Torun said. In a statement, Melina Spadone, representative for Rust Movie Productions, defended the festival against some of the criticism. \"The Camerimage festival celebrates the artistry of cinematographers; it is not a festival for buyers. \"None of the producers of Rust stand to benefit financially from the film. The suggestion that those involved in completing Halyna Hutchins\u2019 film were motivated by profit is disrespectful to those who worked tirelessly to honor her legacy.\u201d",

    "The first phase of work is being carried out at Mossyard\n\nDrivers and residents have shared frustrations over a 96-mile (150km) diversion put in place for an overnight road closure in southern Scotland. Improvement works on the A75 in Dumfries and Galloway mean a stretch of the road will be closed between 20:00 and 06:00 this week, with more work planned at the end of the month. Road maintenance firm Amey said the diversion could take up to two-and-a-half hours but it had done all it could to minimise disruption. People affected have said the closure is \"totally unnecessary\" and was having a major impact.\n\nThe overnight closure takes drivers up towards Ayr and back down\n\nThe A75 between Gretna and Stranraer is the main route across Dumfries and Galloway going to and from the ferry ports at Cairnryan. Work began last week at Mossyard and continues its next phase at Auchenlarie. Overnight closures take place from Monday night until Sunday morning, with more work planned between 28 October and 2 November. It means journeys between Newton Stewart and Castle Douglas - which would normally take about 40 minutes - could take more than four times longer. Among those affected are campaigners against a new national park in the area. Denise Brownlee, of Gatehouse of Fleet, said a recent evening meeting in Castle Douglas had suffered an adverse impact.\n\nCampaigners Denise Brownlee and Liz Hitschmann said they felt total closure was \"totally unnecessary\"\n\n\"A lot of people coming from the west side of Galloway couldn't actually attend because the road closure meant them driving little single track-type roads going home,\" she explained. \"This shows it's putting people off from doing any travelling and attending meetings, no matter how important they are, or basically doing anything in the evening. \"A net result is the meetings we've had planned for Wigtown, Newton Stewart and elsewhere have all had to be cancelled because there's no way in the dark and rain at this time of the year that I'm going to consider driving on some of this narrow track roads. It doesn\u2019t feel safe.\" She said the reality was that even when fully open, the A75 was not fit for purpose due to the volume of traffic and types of vehicles using the route.\n\nLiz Hitschmann, also of Gatehouse of Fleet, campaigns alongside Ms Brownlee and has seen the impact of the closure first hand. She said: \"On the first night that the closure happened, there were no diversion signs in place, so the lorries were queued up all the way from Auchenlarie right the way back to Gatehouse which is some two to three miles. \"And then because the lorries didn\u2019t know where to go they were coming through Gatehouse, which is not really made for lorry traffic, and that in itself caused a lot of problems. \"The fact that they weren\u2019t notified and the signage wasn\u2019t ready, and even now the signage is very small and totally inadequate.\" She said she felt the closures were \"totally unnecessary\" and a convoy system could have been used. Mike Edwards lives on a minor road near the A75 and he said he had seen an increase in drivers using it as an alternative route \"bang-on\" when the road closure started.\n\nMike Edwards lives on a quiet road which often sees increased traffic during road closures\n\n\"The inconvenience to locals is the unusually heavy traffic late into the night, in what is normally a very quiet area when the content of the A75 turns up on your doorstep,\" he said. He said there was also an issue of knowing whether you could get to work as the road could be blocked by a large truck. \"There is wear and tear on our roads, which have little or no maintenance at all,\" he added. \"There has been no signage placed to stop them from using this unusable route for them creating more havoc late into the night.\" Kevin Harris of Donaghadee in Northern Ireland is a regular traveller along the route.\n\n\"We use the road two or three times a month to get to and from the Belfast ferry at Cairnryan,\" he said. \"The diversion is a real pain as other roads around there are often very small. \"We try to take local roads around which often end up in us travelling on very unsuitable roads.\" He said he was planning a trip towing a trailer which might have to see him go the \"long way around\" adding significant time and costs. Pete Barraclough from North Yorkshire said it had affected his recent visit to the Wigtown Book Festival. \"There was no signage on the A75 warning that it would close at 20:00 and no diversion signage when it did,\" he said. \"Eventually figured out a route via New Galloway but added considerably to the journey.\"\n\nAre you affected by the lengthy diversion off the A75?\n\nAmey, which maintains the route on behalf of Transport Scotland, said the work was needed due to the condition of the carriageway. It added that the dates of the work had been decided in consultation with residents and business and would be suspended during the mid-term break for schools. The company said there had been \"extensive discussions\" with ferry operators, the haulage industry and emergency services to mitigate the impact. It said the diversion route had been agreed with stakeholders and had been used for previous work. It added that by working off-peak and overnight it had made \"every attempt\" to reduce disruption but the improvements represented an investment of \u00a3700,000 in the road.",

Zoe Ball: 'It's time to step away from the early alarm call'\n\nZoe Ball has announced she is stepping down as presenter of Radio 2's Breakfast Show in December. Ball said: \u201cAfter six incredible years on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, it\u2019s time for me to step away from the very early mornings and focus on family.\" She will remain on the station, and said more news on what that would involve would be announced in the new year. Ball later announced that Scott Mills will be her replacement, moving from his afternoon show slot on the station. Ball's last show will be on Friday 20 December, \"just in time for Christmas with plenty of fun and shenanigans,\" she told listeners on her Tuesday show.\n\nScott Mills: \"I am beyond excited to be handed the baton\"\n\nTelling her listeners about her decision, she said: \"I've decided it's time to step away from the early alarm call and start a new chapter. \"We\u2019ve shared a hell of a lot, the good times, the tough times, there\u2019s been a lot of laughter. And I am going to miss you cats.\" She added she would also miss her colleagues, saying they were \"like family to me\". The early morning presenter added: \"But I won\u2019t miss the 4am alarm call, if I'm completely honest. \"You know I love you all to bits.\" Mills said: \u201cZoe and I have been such good friends now for over 25 years and have spent much of that time as part of the same radio family here at Radio 2 and also on Radio 1. \"She's done an incredible job on this show over the past six years, and I am beyond excited to be handed the baton.\u201d Speaking on his afternoon show later on Tuesday, Mills told his listeners: \"I can\u2019t thank you enough for how lovely you all were when I took over from Steve (Wright), and I know that you\u2019re going to extend that love to Trevor Nelson. \"Honestly, I can't wait to start with you every morning.\"\n\nBall said she will miss her listeners and colleagues but not getting up early\n\nBall heaped praise on her successor: \u201cScott and I go way back to our Radio 1 days, when he was doing early mornings before me. He\u2019s been a close friend for years, and I\u2019m beyond thrilled it\u2019s him taking over the Breakfast Show. \"Breakfast has always been his dream. He\u2019s not only a blooming brilliant producer but one of the best in radio. I can\u2019t wait to tune in on the school run!\u201d Mills recently stood in for Ball when she took a few weeks off from her show. Trevor Nelson, who currently presents in the evenings Monday to Thursday, will replace Mills as the presenter of the 2pm to 4pm weekday afternoon show from January. Nelson said: \"I'm looking to have lots of fun and will be bringing a bit of soul to the new show.\" Meanwhile, DJ Spoony will extend his weekly edition of The Good Grove (Friday nights - 9-11pm) to four weekly shows on Monday \u2013 Thursday nights and Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s Kitchen Disco will be extended from one to two hours, kicking off on Friday nights at 9pm.\n\nBall hosted the BBC One Saturday morning children's show Live and Kicking in 1997\n\nBall first joined BBC Radio in October 1997 as the co-host of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show with co-presenter Kevin Greening. From October 1998 to March 2000, Zoe hosted the programme solo, the first woman to do so. Helen Thomas, head of Radio 2, said: \"Zoe has woken up the nation on Radio 2 with incredible warmth, wit and so much joy since January 2019. \"I\u2019d like to thank her for approaching each show with as much vim and vigour as if it were her first. I\u2019m thrilled that that she'll remain an important part of the Radio 2 family.\" She was the BBC's highest-paid on-air female presenter in 2023/24. Her salary of between \u00a3950,000 and \u00a3954,999 ranked her second on the list of top-earning talent behind Gary Lineker, according to the corporation's annual report published in July. Many more stars don't make the list, with several of them almost certainly earning more than Ball and Lineker but they are not named because the BBC does not have to disclose the salaries of stars who are paid through production companies. The latest figures from radio industry body Rajar state that Ball's programme is the most listened to breakfast show in the UK. But it dipped by 146,000 listeners to 6.28 million in the most recent quarter, according to industry figures from Rajar. BBC Radio 2 is the UK\u2019s most listened to radio station, with a weekly audience of 13.3 million, the figures show.

    "For the University of Queensland's Monarchist League, King Charles' visit is seen as a celebration\n\nWith a night of bottomless drinks, a three-course dinner and an auction packed with royal memorabilia, the University of Queensland Monarchist League\u2019s annual ball is a sell-out. Billed as a celebration of the Crown, a rendition of God Save The King followed by Australia\u2019s national anthem kicks off the event. When dinner is done, the bidding starts. First up, a limited-edition Royal Doulton plate with a hand-decorated portrait of the King to mark his 60th birthday. Also on the ticket - an oil painting of King George V and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon signed by monarchist and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. For the 200 students and their guests, the fact that King Charles is travelling over 16,000 km (10,000 miles) across 10 different time zones, to tour the country from 18 to 23 October - all while going through cancer treatment - is a testament to his love of Australia. And for that they are grateful. \"He\u2019s such a big part of our history and our traditions, it\u2019s wonderful we get to celebrate it,\" says student Eliza Kingston. \"He\u2019s just as much the King of Australia as he is the King of England,\" Jeremy Bazley adds enthusiastically. But amid a cost-of-living crisis, many Australians have failed to take notice of the trip at all - while some campaigners have tried to frame it as the royal family\u2019s \u201cfarewell tour\u201d, in a bid to reinvigorate the decades-old republican debate. It\u2019s a question that the government has, for now at least, put on ice - while King Charles earlier this week reiterated longstanding palace policy that the matter should be left for the \u201cpublic to decide\u201d.\n\nEliza Kingston says King Charles' visit allows Australia to celebrate its traditions\n\nLast year\u2019s unsuccessful vote on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has stalled momentum for another referendum - which is the only way to change Australia\u2019s constitution. The bruising campaign divided the nation at times, while leaving many of its first inhabitants feeling silenced. It\u2019s a backdrop that will no doubt impact the tone of this royal tour, which includes events in Sydney and Canberra, and is the first in over a decade.\n\nThis will be King Charles's 17th visit to Australia. His first was in 1966, when he came as a teenage prince to spend two terms at Timbertop - a campus of a boarding school in the mountains of Victoria. His time there was, he said, \u201cby far the best\u201d experience of his education. He's since returned 15 times for official tours, including a trip with Princess Diana to one of the country's most famous landmarks, Uluru. Most recently, he opened the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.\n\nKing Charles spent two semesters at Timbertop school in Victoria as a teenager\n\nSo, what sort of welcome will he receive since becoming King? The data suggests the nation is split. A snapshot survey after his coronation, conducted by Roy Morgan Research, indicated 60% of Australians wanted the country to remain a constitutional monarchy. But last year, a poll by YouGov suggested that number had dwindled to 35%, and that 32% of people appeared to favour becoming a republic as soon as possible. A further 12% felt that should only happen when the King died, and 21% just didn\u2019t know. And while just over a third of those questioned thought the monarchy was good for the country, about 20% thought it was bad - while 38% were indifferent.\n\nCharlotte Greatrex (c) and Gus Van Aanholt (left) say younger generations don't have as much of a connection with the monarchy\n\nAt the Royal Hotel Darlington pub, opposite the University of Sydney, students who have finished classes and are headed for a pint had no idea that a visit from the King was imminent. \"To be honest, not that many people would know about it or think too much about it,\" says 19-year-old Charlotte Greatrex. \"We all get very swept up in uni or whatever's going on in our own lives that it doesn't seem to influence us that much.\u201d Her friend Gus Van Aanholt agrees: \"I feel older generations, like my parents and my grandparents, would have much more of a stronger connection to the monarchy.\u201d Polling has often pointed to a generational gap \u2013 indicating increased support for the monarchy among older Australians. Ahead of the King\u2019s visit the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) wants to capitalise on what it sees as a growing indifference to the monarchy. It recently released a tongue-in-cheek media campaign depicting King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales as ageing rock stars delivering their final show, while encouraging people to \u201cwave goodbye to royal reign\u201d. Although a 1999 referendum on becoming a republic was resoundingly defeated, the ARM would like to see the question put to the people again. \"We\u2019ve been independent for a long time now but that last little step of independence for us is splitting away from the monarchy,\" says co-chair Nathan Hansford. \"Regardless of whatever connotations you want to put towards the British royal family in the past, it's really a story about us moving forward as a nation.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has long said Austalia's future is one without a monarchy\n\nWhen the King and Queen fly into Sydney on Friday, they will be greeted by one of Australia's most prominent republicans, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He has long made it clear that his country\u2019s future should be one without a monarchy. He even appointed an assistant minister for the republic. But in recent months, a cabinet reshuffle and the removal of the republican portfolio revealed that plans to hold a vote on the issue had been shelved. Like much of the world, Australians are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of everyday essentials, and the government knows it's not going to win a referendum when there isn't the appetite for what many would see as an expensive distraction. In short, Albanese has assessed that a republican vote is not a priority for the general public right now.\n\nAllira Davis, co-chair of the Uluru Youth Dialogue, says Australia still has to grapple with the ongoing impacts of its colonial past\n\nFor their part, many Indigenous Australians feel last year\u2019s referendum result was a clear indication the country still has a lot of work to do to grapple with the ongoing impacts of its colonial past, before it can debate its future. \u201cI think if we do end up going to another referendum, we have to make sure that we deal with First Nations issues\u2026 we still have people experiencing intergenerational trauma, so understanding the history of what has happened in this country is really key,\u201d says Allira Davis, a Cobble Cobble woman and co-chair of the Uluru Youth Dialogue. She\u2019s proud, though, of how much more diverse the nation has become, since King Charles first touched down as a 17-year-old. \"We're not white Australia anymore, we're a brown Australia. \"We have multicultural, diverse backgrounds coming from all nations, and it'd be very interesting to see a brown head of state, or a black head of state but before we do that, we need to include our First Nations and recognise that.\"",
    "Somebody moved UK's oldest satellite, and no-one knows who or why\n\nArtwork: The half-tonne Skynet-1A satellite was launched in November 1969\n\nSomeone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why. Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces. When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean. But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.\n\nOrbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location. Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose? It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago. \"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves. \"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis. \"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.\n\nIf a satellite died at 40E it would drift to the nearest gravity well, which is 75E.\n\nDr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft. It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise. But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.\n\nWhat we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket. \"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation. This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire. \"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me. \"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.\n\nCould the command to move Skynet-1A have come from the US Air Force's 'Blue Cube'?\n\nRachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives. Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility. \"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated. The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977. But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\". This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites. Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.\n\nBritish engineers are developing technologies to snare defunct satellites in low orbits\n\nAttitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested. At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day. That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort. The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.\n\nThe Americans have already shown it's possible to grab a high-orbiting satellite\n\nUltimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location. Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space. Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A. \"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. \"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",
    "Macron calls to halt arms deliveries to Israel in Gaza war\n\nMacron speaks during a press conference at the 19th Francophonie Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza on Saturday, prompting swift criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Macron told France Inter radio that \"the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza\". At a summit in Paris, the French president reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza continuing despite ceasefire calls, and he also criticised Israel's decision to send ground troops into Lebanon. Netanyahu quickly pushed back but during a telephone call between the two leaders on Sunday, Macron reiterated France's \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel.\n\nIn a video earlier released by his office, Netanyahu said \"Israel will win with orwithout their support\", adding that calling for an arms embargo was \"a disgrace\". \"Shame on them,\" he said, referring to Macron and other Western leaders who have called for what he described as an arms embargo on Israel. Macron, in an interview with the French broadcaster which was recorded on Tuesday and aired on Saturday, said \"France is not delivering any\" weapons to Israel. He added: \"I think we are not being heard.\" \"I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel,\" he said, adding that the conflict was leading to \"hatred\". Macron also said that avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a \"priority\" and that \"Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza\". Netanyahu's office responded by saying that any country that did not stand with Israel was supporting Iran and its allies and proxies. Netanyahu said: \"As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side. \"Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them.\" Macron's office later said that France is a \"steadfast friend of Israel\", adding that Netanyahu's reaction was \"excessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel\".\n\nSpeaking in Paris on Saturday, Macron said that while both the US and France had called for a ceasefire in Lebanon, he added: \"I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil.\" However, Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence and said that he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza on Monday. During a telephone conversation on Sunday, Netanyahu told the French President that Israel's fight against the Hezbollah group would help \"change the reality\" in Lebanon and bring stability to the entire Middle East, a statement from his office said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s friends are expected to stand behind it, and not impose restrictions on it that will only strengthen the Iranian axis of evil,\u201d Netanyahu was reported to have said during their call. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his country's \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel's security, according to his office. Monday will mark the first anniversary of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\u2022 None Where does Israel get its weapons?\n\u2022 None How could Israel respond, and what might Iran do then?\n\u2022 None Israeli kibbutz struggles to heal, one year after 7 October",
    "Yusely Perez says she was forced to collect firewood to burn for cooking\n\nCuba has endured one of its toughest weeks in years after a nationwide blackout which left around 10 million Cubans without power for several days. Adding to the Caribbean island\u2019s problems, Hurricane Oscar left a trail of destruction along the north-eastern coast, leaving several dead and causing widespread damage. For some communities in Cuba the energy crisis is the new normal. As Cuba approached its fourth day without power this week, Yusely Perez turned to the only fuel source left available to her: firewood. Her neighbourhood in Havana hasn\u2019t received its regular deliveries of liquified gas cannisters for two months. So once the island\u2019s entire electrical grid went down, prompting a nationwide blackout, Yusely was forced to take desperate measures. \u201cMe and my husband went all over the city, but we couldn\u2019t find charcoal anywhere,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe had to collect firewood wherever we found it on the street. Thankfully it was dry enough to cook with.\u201d Yusely nodded at the yucca chips frying slowly in a pot of lukewarm oil. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone two days without eating,\u201d she adds.\n\nCuba's energy infrastructure needs more investment, economists say\n\nSpeaking last Sunday, at the height of what was Cuba\u2019s most acute energy crisis in years, the country\u2019s energy and mines minister, Vicente de la O Levy, blamed the problems for the country\u2019s creaking electrical infrastructure on what he called the \u201cbrutal\u201d US economic embargo on Cuba. The embargo, he argued, made it impossible to import new parts to overhaul the grid or bring in enough fuel to run the power stations, even to access credit in the international banking system. The US State Department retorted that the problems with energy production in Cuba did not lie at Washington\u2019s door - but argued that it was due to the Cuban government\u2019s own mismanagement. Normal service would be resumed soon, the Cuban minister insisted. But no sooner did he utter those words than there was another total collapse of the grid, the fourth in 48 hours. At night, the full extent of the blackout became clear. Havana\u2019s streets were plunged into near total darkness as residents sat on the doorsteps in the stifling heat, their faces lit up by their mobile phones \u2013 as long as their batteries lasted.\n\nResidents of Havana were without electricity at night\n\nSome, like restaurant worker Victor, were prepared to openly criticise the authorities. \u201cThe people who run this country are the ones who have all the answers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to have to explain themselves to the Cuban people.\u201d Specifically, the state\u2019s decision to invest heavily in tourism, rather than energy infrastructure, frustrated him most during the blackout. \u201cThey\u2019ve built so many hotels in the past few years. Everyone knows that a hotel doesn\u2019t cost a couple of bucks. It costs 300 or 400 million dollars.\u201d \u201cSo why is our energy infrastructure collapsing?\u201d he asks. \u201cEither they\u2019re not investing in it or, if they are, then it\u2019s not been to the benefit of the people.\u201d Aware of the growing discontentment, President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on state TV wearing the traditional olive-green fatigues of the Cuban revolution. If that message wasn\u2019t clear enough, he directly warned people against protesting over the blackout. The authorities would not \u201ctolerate\u201d vandalism, he said, or any attempt to \u201cdisrupt the social order\u201d.\n\nPeople were lit up by their mobile phones as they sat outside in the heat\n\nThe protests of July 2021, when hundreds were arrested amid widespread demonstrations following a series of blackouts, were fresh in the memory. On this occasion, there were only a handful of reports of isolated incidents. Yet the question of where Cuba chooses to direct its scarce resources remains a real point of contention on the island. \u201cWhen we talk about energy infrastructure, that refers to both generation and distribution or transmission. In every step, a lot of investment is needed,\u201d says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres, at the American University in Washington DC. Electricity generation in Cuba has recently fallen well below what\u2019s required, only supplying some 60-70% of the national demand. The shortfall is a \u201chuge and serious gap\u201d which is now being felt across the island, says Mr Torres. By the government\u2019s own figures, Cuba\u2019s national electricity generation dropped by around 2.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, part of a downward trend which has seen a staggering 25% drop in production since 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that last week\u2019s problem in the energy grid isn\u2019t something that happens overnight,\u201d says Mr Torres.\n\nMarbeyis Aguilera says she has had no power for six days\n\nFew know that better than Marbeyis Aguilera. The 28-year-old mother-of-three is getting used to living without electricity. For Marbeyis, even \u201cnormal service\u201d being restored still means most of the day without power. In fact, what the residents of Havana endured for a few days is what daily life is like in her village of Aguacate in the province of Artemisa, outside Havana. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no power for six days\u201d, she says, brewing coffee on a makeshift charcoal stove inside her breeze-block, tin-roofed shack. \u201cIt came on for a couple of hours last night and then went out again. We have no choice but to cook like this or use firewood to provide something warm for the children,\u201d she adds. Her two gas hobs and one electric ring sit idle on the kitchen top, the room filling with smoke. The community is in dire need of state assistance, she says, listing their most urgent priorities. \u201cFirst, electricity. Secondly, we need water. Food is running out. People with dollars, sent from abroad, can buy food. But we don\u2019t have any so we can\u2019t buy anything.\u201d\n\nMarbeyis cooks for her three daughters using a basic stove\n\nMarbeyis says some of the main problems in Aguacate \u2013 food insecurity and water distribution \u2013 have been exacerbated by the power cuts. Her husband\u2019s manual labour also requires electricity and he\u2019s stuck at home waiting for the instruction to come to work. The Cuban Government was due to recall state workers by Thursday \u2013 but to avoid another collapse in the grid, all non-essential work and schools have now been suspended until next week. \u201cIt\u2019s especially hard on the children\u201d, Marbeyis adds, her eyes tearing up, \u201cbecause when they say I want this or that, we have nothing to give them.\u201d Living without a reliable energy source is the new normal in places like Aguacate. Many have been struggling with power shortages since around the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which coincided with a sharp economic downturn on the island.\n\nIn Marbeyis' home village of Aguacate there is not a reliable electricity supply\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem for the Cuban State is that the sight of people cooking with firewood and charcoal in the 21st Century is reminiscent of the poverty under dictator Fulgencio Bastista, who the revolutionaries ousted six-and-half decades ago. Amid it all, on the north-eastern coast, the situation got even worse. As people were still coping with the blackout, Hurricane Oscar made landfall, bringing high winds, flash flooding and ripping roofs from homes. The storm may have passed. But Cubans know that such is the precarious state of the island\u2019s energy infrastructure that the next nationwide blackout could come at any time.",
    "Leicestershire Police has issued CCTV images of two men officers wish to speak to\n\nPolice have launched a CCTV appeal after three armed robberies at supermarkets in Leicestershire. The incidents, which are reported to have involved a gun, took place in Wigston on Thursday, Evington on Friday and Enderby on Saturday. A 40-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery, Leicestershire Police said. The force also released images of two men officers would like to speak to as part of the investigation.\n\nAccording to police, the first robbery happened at Tesco in Blaby Road at about 23:55 BST on Thursday, while the second took place a day later at Tesco in Ethel Road at about 21:40. The third was reported at Sainsbury's near Fosse Park at about 09:25 on Saturday. In all three incidents, two men entered the stores at separate times before trying to leave without paying for bottles of alcohol, police said. When challenged by staff, threats were made with a gun before the suspects reportedly left with bottles of alcohol.\n\nA knife was also used during the incident at the Sainsbury's store, police added, but no serious injuries have been reported following the robberies. Det Insp George Fraser said: \"We are treating these incidents as a priority in force and our investigation and enquiries are very much ongoing. \u201cWe are looking to speak to the men pictured and urge anyone who recognises them to make contact with us immediately. \u201cIf you see the men, please do not approach them but please contact 999 immediately.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester",

PC Huw Orphan, 32, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm at Cardiff Crown Court. He denied attacking Amy Burley, who also worked for Gwent Police, at their home in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, in 2020, claiming he accidentally caught her with his leg after a row and was cleared of a more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Earlier this month, he was banned from joining any police force during a misconduct hearing by the Gwent force, which said he would have been dismissed immediately if he had not resigned shortly beforehand.\n\nIn an impact statement read to the court, Ms Burley said she had been left with frequent pain and mobility issues. \"I'm unable to sit or stand for a long period of time and I have a very poor and irregular sleep pattern,\" she said. \"I was unable to perform simple activities with my children, such as playing and having fun. \"After six months of sick leave, I went off on unpaid leave which has affected me and my family financially. I\u2019m constantly drained by the whole thing.\"\n\nJudge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said: \"This was a grave injury, as demonstrated not only by the injury itself, but by her personal statement, which shows she is still significantly affected more than four years after the incident.\" The jury was told the couple met in 2017 while working for Gwent Police and got married two years later.

    "Abida Sultaan was the eldest daughter of the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan\n\nAbida Sultaan was nothing like your typical princess. She wore her hair short, shot tigers and was an ace polo player. She flew planes and drove herself around in a Rolls-Royce from the age of nine. Born in 1913 into a family of brave 'begums' (a Muslim woman of high rank) who ruled the northern princely state of Bhopal in British India for over a century, Abida continued their legacy of defying stereotypes around women in general and Muslim women in particular. She refused to be in purdah - a practice followed by Muslim, and some Hindu women, of wearing clothes that conceal them and secluding themselves from men - and became heir to the throne at the age of 15. Abida ran her father's cabinet for more than a decade, rubbed shoulders with India's prominent freedom fighters and would eventually come to have a ringside view of the hate and violence the country disintegrated into after it was partitioned in 1947 to create Pakistan. She was groomed from a young age to take on the mantle of ruler under the guidance of her grandmother, Sultan Jehan, a strict disciplinarian who was the ruler of Bhopal. In her 2004 autobiography, Memoirs of a Rebel Princess, Abida writes about how she had to wake up at four in the morning to read the Quran - the religious text of Islam - and then proceed with a day filled with activities, which included learning sports, music and horse riding, but also included chores like sweeping the floor and cleaning bathrooms. \"We girls were not allowed to feel any inferiority on account of our sex. Everything was equal. We had all the freedom that a boy had; we could ride, climb trees, play any game we chose to. There were no restrictions,\" she said in an interview about her childhood. Abida had a fierce, independent streak even as a child and rebelled against her grandmother when she forced her into purdah at the age of 13. Her chutzpah coupled with her father's broad-mindedness helped her escape the practice for the rest of her life. Already heir to the throne of Bhopal, Abida stood the chance of becoming part of the royal family of the neighbouring princely state of Kurwai as well when at the age of 12, she was married off to Sarwar Ali Khan, her childhood friend and ruler Kurwai. She described her nikah (wedding), about which she was clueless, in hilarious detail in her memoir. She writes about how one day, while she was pillow-fighting with her cousins, her grandmother walked into the room and asked her to dress up for a wedding. Only, no one told her that she was the bride. \"No-one had prepared or instructed me on how to conduct myself, with the result that I walked into the nikah chamber, pushing the gathered women out of my way, my face uncovered, sulking as usual for being chosen again for some new experiment,\" she writes. The wedding was brief like Abida's marriage, which lasted for less than a decade.\n\nAbida was an accomplished polo player and marksman\n\nMarried life was difficult for Abida, not just because of her young age but also because of her strict, pious upbringing. She candidly describes how a lack of knowledge and discomfort with sex took a toll on her marriage. \"Immediately after my wedding, I entered the world of conjugal trauma. I had not realised that the consummation that followed would leave me so horrified, numbed and feeling unchaste,\" she writes and adds that she could never bring herself to \"accept marital relations between husband and wife\". This led to the breakdown of her marriage. In her paper, external on intimacy and sexuality in the autobiographical writings of Muslim women in South Asia, historian Siobhan Lambert-Hurley underscores how Abida's honest reflections on sexual intimacy with her husband tear apart the stereotype that Muslim women do not write about sex, by presenting an unabashed voice on the topic. After her marriage fell apart, Abida left her marital home in Kurwai and moved back to Bhopal. But the couple's only son, Shahryar Mohammad Khan, became the subject of an ugly custody dispute. Frustrated by the drawn-out battle and not wanting to part with her son, Abida took a bold step to make her husband back off. On a warm night in March 1935, Abida drove for three hours straight to reach her husband's home in Kurwai. She entered his bedroom, pulled out a revolver, threw it in her husband's lap and said: \"Shoot me or I will shoot you.\" This incident, coupled with a physical confrontation between the couple in which Abida emerged victorious, put an end to the custody dispute. She proceeded to raise her son as a single mother while juggling her duties as heir to the throne. She ran her state's cabinet from 1935 till 1949, when Bhopal was merged with the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Abida also attended the round-table conferences - called by the British government to decide the future government of India - during which she met influential leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Motilal Nehru and his son, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was to become India's first prime minister. She also experienced first-hand the deteriorating relationship between Hindus and Muslims and the violence that broke out in the aftermath of India's partition in 1947.\n\nIn her memoir Abida describes the discrimination she began facing in Bhopal; how her family, who had lived there peacefully for generations, began to be treated as \"outsiders\". In one of her interviews, external, she spoke about a particularly disturbing memory she had of the violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims. One day, after the Indian government informed her that a train carrying Muslim refugees would arrive in Bhopal, she went to the railway station to supervise the arrival. \"When the compartments were opened, they were all dead,\" she said and added that it was this violence and distrust that drove her to move to Pakistan in 1950. Abida left quietly, with only her son and hopes for a brighter future. In Pakistan, she championed democracy and women's rights through her political career. Abida died in Karachi in 2002. After she left for Pakistan, the Indian government had made her sister heir to the throne. But Abida is still known in Bhopal, where people refer to her by her nickname 'bia huzoor'. \"Religious politics over the past few years have chipped away at her legacy and she isn't spoken about as much any more,\" says journalist Shams Ur Rehman Alavi, who has been researching Bhopal's women rulers. \"But her name isn't likely to be forgotten anytime soon.\"",

Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile, who was also a former Belfast lord mayor, confirmed police were notified but no formal complaint was received. Mary Lou McDonald said, following a referral by Sinn F\u00e9in, there were no findings of illegality and no criminal charges were pursued. She has come under pressure over the party's handling of recent child safeguarding issues.\n\nMr \u00d3 Donnghaile confirmed in a statement to the Irish News, external, external on Tuesday that he sent an inappropriate text to a youth member of the party, a 17-year-old boy in Northern Ireland. The message is believed to have been personal in nature but not sexually explicit.\n\nThe party said when it got the complaint in September 2023, it followed its child protection policy, suspended Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile, and referred them to police and the social services. The same month, Sinn F\u00e9in said the PSNI told them it was not carrying out an investigation. Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile later resigned from the party. On Tuesday, McDonald said a second person, an adult, had also received inappropriate texts from Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile and was advised of their right to make a complaint but they did not. In his statement to the Irish News, Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile said he accepted his behaviour warranted stepping down from his role in the Seanad and as a party member. He said it would give him \"the space to focus on improving\" his health and well-being, issues he added he had been dealing with since 2021. BBC News NI has contacted him for comment.\n\nMary Lou McDonald made a statement in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday\n\nIn a statement at the time, Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile said he had been unable to attend the Seanad since the summer recess \"on the advice of my doctor\". At the time, McDonald issued a statement thanking him for his service to the party. During a debate on Tuesday, she repeated that he had previously been on leave due to \"serious mental health issues\". \"We were advised at the time he stepped down he was suffering from a mental health crisis after the complaint and was deemed medically unfit for work,\" McDonald said. \"We were worried publicly naming him would be dangerous to his health and we had very serious concerns for his health and safety - I still hold some to this day.\"\n\nIn a social media post reacting to the news on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said when Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile stepped down his party \"enabled a graceful departure\" but \"they knew the real reason\". \"The contempt and apparent cover up continues,\" he added. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party have called for First Minister Michelle O'Neill to give a statement to the assembly on the issue. T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy PM) and Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said the latest revelations about Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile \"raise serious and fundamental questions about the party and its governance\". He claimed the Oireachtas was \"misled on the full reasons\" for his resignation. \"It is apparent when it comes to Sinn F\u00e9in, the party always comes first,\" he said.\n\nThese controversies may have different complexities and timelines, but they all raise questions of accountability and transparency. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s political rivals will be lining up to ask who knew what and when. And in particular, the focus will be on how Sinn F\u00e9in dealt with those issues which related to child safeguarding. Sinn F\u00e9in will hope McDonald setting out in full the party\u2019s actions will help take the heat out of recent weeks.

The party faced criticism after it emerged that two Sinn F\u00e9in press officers gave references for their former colleague for a job with a charity. In September, McMonagle admitted to a series of offences, including attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity. He is due to be sentenced in the coming weeks. Both press officers, Se\u00e1n Mag Uidhir and Caol\u00e1n McGinley, have since resigned. On this, McDonald said she has instigated an overhaul of procedures in the party. Speaking in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday, McDonald also reiterated that the move by two former press officers to provide Michael McMonagle with job references when he was under investigation for child sex offences was \"reprehensible and unforgivable\". She said Mag Uidhir and McGinley \"knew their actions were sackable offences so they jumped before they were pushed\".

    "Alex Salmond loved creating headlines. He would be disappointed if he gave an interview that was not sufficiently interesting to make the news. As a young radio journalist, I was sent to see him at a business breakfast event where at that time he was demanding the UK join the single European currency. When I suggested this was not new, that he\u2019d said it many times before, he said: \u201cYes but I\u2019m saying it more forcefully now because the case is more urgent.\u201d Anything to make his contribution count. Spending time in his company could easily make you late. He tended not to limit interview duration and enjoyed further conversation, debate and showing off a bit after the microphones were off.\n\nI can remember interviewing him in his early days as first minister at his official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh. The interview was over and I needed to go - but he wanted to show me a collection of silverware that had been found in a cupboard, and share something of its history. While he could be charming and entertaining and always offered a sharp analysis of the politics of the day, there was also a less pleasant side to his character. I would wince when sometimes he would show impatience and irritation towards his staff. He could be very demanding of them. I can also remember bringing a senior BBC editor from the newsroom in London to see him, and was astonished when he asked my colleague if he was on a colonial visit.\n\nAlex Salmond and Alistair Darling took part in a debate chaired by Glenn Campbell ahead of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014\n\nHe had a love/hate relationship with the BBC. He loved when he was offered a prestigious spot on a network show like Question Time, especially when his political career was in decline. At other times, he would rage against output he did not like. He was not happy that I interviewed, anonymously, one of the women who had accused him of sexual offences in court, after he had been acquitted of all charges. It was not an attempt to re-try the case but a response to his claims of a political conspiracy. I am not sure he forgave me for that. I travelled with him to Europe, the United States and China. I remember him turning up uncharacteristically early at the Forbidden City in Beijing to meet China\u2019s vice-premier and finding himself locked out. It would have made powerful TV footage but I don\u2019t think we got it on camera. He thought we had captured this embarrassing moment and gave me a private briefing and a couple of scoops in the hope I wouldn\u2019t use it.\n\nAlex Salmond lived and breathed politics and he seemed completely lost when he was ejected from parliament in 2017. I bumped into him in Edinburgh soon after and we shared a taxi to Waverley station. Naturally we talked politics and when it came time to part he just kept the conversation going. In recent years, we talked far less. He refused to take part in a podcast series I made about Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s time in office - which would obviously have included the spectacular rift between them. That was not like him. In all my previous experience, he rarely missed a media opportunity. Better in his view to get out there and make his case rather than shy away and let others set the narrative.",
    "Man dies after tree falls on car as Storm Bert sweeps UK\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA man has died after a tree fell on his car as Storm Bert brought strong winds, rain, and snow and caused disruption across the UK. Hampshire Police said a man in his 60s died after a tree hit his car on the A34 near Winchester early on Saturday morning. Road, rail, and air passengers all saw delays and cancellations, while thousands of homes have been left without power. Yellow weather warnings for rain and wind are in place across the UK, as well as dozens of flood warnings in England, Wales and Scotland. Meteorologists have described it as a multi-hazard storm.\n\nIn England, snowfall caused the closure of a number of A-roads, while a number of rail companies - including Northern Rail and Avanti West Coast - were forced to cancel dozens of services. Two other people died on Saturday in crashes on the roads during the stormy weather, one in West Yorkshire and another in Northamptonshire - although it is not known if they were directly related to the conditions. A major search and rescue operation was launched in Sidmouth, Devon, after members of the public spotted an object in a river. Newcastle Airport and Leeds Bradford Airport both saw numerous flights delayed, although both later said they were operating as normal. National Highways issued a severe weather alert for snow on roads in Yorkshire and north-east England in anticipation of blizzard conditions and said snow would \"accumulate quickly at all levels\". Scotland was hit by even more snow than anticipated on Saturday, causing long traffic jams and multiple road closures. Lothian buses suspended all of its 70 routes across Edinburgh and surrounding areas, and there were delays and cancellations to ScotRail services. The Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth was closed due to the threat of falling ice. A number of Scottish football matches were also affected. The kick-off of Rangers' afternoon game against Dundee United was pushed back by 45 minutes following travel issues, while at least two Scottish Championship games have been called off altogether. Earlier snow has given way to rain for many, but that the threat of disruption is not yet over.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Flooding after snowfall turns to water in Cumbria\n\nTim Robertson, 58, who lives in Coniston Waterhead, Cumbria, sent the BBC footage of an area in which overnight snowfall had quickly melted and left a road waterlogged. \"We woke up to about four inches of snow,\" he said. \u201cSince then, the snow has been melting and, with the rain as well, there\u2019s been a lot of water. \u201cWe went out for a walk in the woods and when we came back, that particular stretch of road was flooded. Cars were still getting through. I\u2019m not sure how wise that was.\"\n\u2022 None How do storms like Bert get their names? He added that some of the roads had since cleared. Early on Sunday, a total of 49 floods warnings remain in force in England, mostly around the northwest, while 160 alerts are in force across the southwest, Midlands, and northwest. As of 19:00 GMT on Saturday, the National Grid said 1,186 homes in Wales and 819 in south-west England were without power, though both figures were down from earlier in the day.\n\nThe most affected parts of south Wales were expected to see up to 150mm of rainfall on Saturday, equivalent to the average rainfall for the whole of November in just a day. Natural Resources Wales said there was flooding to low-lying areas in parts of Carmarthenshire near the River Loughor, with river levels set to rise and flooding of property expected. In Denbighshire, north Wales, five adults and five children were rescued from a house following a landslide. Sixteen flood warnings and 51 flood alerts are in force in areas across the country. Winds from Storm Bert strengthened on Saturday morning, with top gusts of 82mph recorded at Capel Curig (Conwy) and 75mph at Needles, an exposed site on the western tip of the Isle of Wight. In Scotland, the Cairngorm mountains saw blizzard conditions and winds of up to 105mph. Strong winds also forced the closure of the Severn Bridge, which connects Gloucestershire and south Wales. Ferry companies were also affected. Operator CalMac - which serves the west coast of Scotland - cancelled several services, while P&O Ferries cancelled one service and Irish Ferries cancelled numerous crossings to Wales. The charity that maintains London's royal parks, which include Hype Park and Kensington Gardens, said all eight would be closed on Sunday and have delayed openings on Monday because of concerns about severe wind gusts.\n\nAreas of Ireland were also hit by flooding, with the west of the country appearing to be worst-affected. At one point, 60,000 customers across the country were left without power.\n\nHow have you been affected by the snow and ice?",

    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nTen-year-old Sara Sharif suffered injuries which were comparable to a person involved in a car crash, a court has heard. The girl's body, which was found in her family's home in Surrey last year, had signs of healing spinal fractures which had then been rebroken, the Old Bailey was told. Her father Urfan Sharif, 42, stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder. Jurors previously heard the girl had been hooded, burned, bitten and beaten during more than two years of abuse.\n\nGiving evidence, paediatric radiologist Prof Owen Arthurs told the court that spinal fractures were \u201cvery rare\u201d and usually caused by high impact or high speed trauma, such as road traffic incidents. He also told jurors that Sara\u2019s neck injuries were \u201cextremely rare\u201d. \u201cThe most likely cause is manual strangulation with a degree of force above that which we would normally recognise in ligature force, like hanging,\" he told the court.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nThe court previously heard that Sara had suffered puncture wounds, burns, bruising and abrasions, and a post-mortem examination found Sara had \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC previously said a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. The court also previously heard Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Sara's five brothers and sisters on 9 August 2023, the day before her body was found. Prosecutors said Mr Sharif called police from Pakistan and admitted he killed Sara about an hour after his family\u2019s flight had landed in Islamabad. Jurors were told Mr Sharif's case was that Ms Batool was responsible for Sara's death, and he made a false confession on the phone call and also in a note to protect his wife. The three defendants, who lived with Sara in Woking before her death, are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they deny.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "British Airways passengers were left stranded on the tarmac in multiple airports in the UK and internationally after a \"technical issue\" disrupted operations. The problems, which the airline says have now been solved, started at around 17:00 on Monday, with passengers posting on social media that they were standing in the cold waiting to find out what was happening to their flights. BA said a problem that affected some of its computer systems had caused the delays. \"We\u2019ve apologised to customers for delays to their flights and ensured they were able to reach their destinations as planned,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nIn an earlier update on the disruption, the company said no flights had been cancelled. Downdetector, a website that logs complaints with websites that are not working, indicated a sharp increase in problems with the BA site after 17:00. It is not clear how widespread the disruption was, but it was reported to have affected flights globally, as well as some domestic UK flights. Travel expert and journalist Simon Calder estimated the problems could have affected tens of thousands of passengers, although the delays seemed to be limited to one or two hours for affected flights. One passenger wrote on X that they were \"being made to stand on the tarmac in a very cold Verona waiting for an already delayed flight\".

Payne died, aged 31, after falling from the third floor of hotel balcony in Argentina on Wednesday. Malik was about to start the US leg of his tour next week - starting with a show in San Francisco on Wednesday. However, the singer told fans he was postponing the shows - saying: \"Given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week, I've made the decision to postpone the US leg of the Stairway to the Sky Tour.\"\n\nThe US part of Malik's tour was due to also visit Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, ending in New York on 3 November.

The 31-year-old did not mention the 11 dates of the UK leg of his tour, which are expected to run from 20 November to 4 December. On Thursday, Malik paid tribute to Payne, saying he would \"cherish all the memories I have with you in my heart forever\". \"I lost a brother when you left us and can't explain to you what I'd give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly,\" he said.\n\nZayn Malik said he would \"cherish all the memories\" with Liam Payne\n\nPayne and Malik rose to global fame as part of the boyband One Direction - created on The X Factor TV show in 2010 - and sang together with bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and Niall Horan.

    "Several front pages reflect on the UK's decision to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The Financial Times describes it as \"Historic accord\", but the Daily Mail says critics have called the deal \"shameful\", summarising with the headline \"Starmer's surrender\".\n\nThe Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer received private warnings from the United States about the deal and there were concerns among officials that it could benefit China, an ally of Mauritius, a claim denied by government insiders.\n\nIn its editorial, the Daily Telegraph has described the move as a \"national scandal\", labelling it a \"giveaway\". The Mirror disagrees, saying ministers have \"finally put right one of the last remaining wrongs from British colonial rule\". In its coverage, the Guardian focuses on the reaction of Chagossians.\n\nThe paper says not everyone is happy sovereignty has been passed to Mauritius but it quotes one campaigner who says the deal is a \"recognition of the injustice done against those who were forced to leave their homes\".\n\nThe I says UK scientists are working on a vaccine to \"wipe out ovarian cancer within five years\". The jab, which is being created by researchers at Oxford University, works by teaching the immune system to recognise and attack the earliest stages of the cancer. The paper says there are hopes it could be given to women preventively on the NHS, \"with the aim of eliminating the disease\".\n\nThe Mirror also covers the story, with the headline \"scientists aim for world first\".\n\nBoris Johnson has told the Telegraph he believes Britain needs a referendum on its membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. The former prime minister says there's a \"strong case\" to give the public a say on the matter. He also suggests the ECHR doesn't \"provide people with protections they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have\u201d.\n\nMany of the papers have picked up on Prince William saying he didn't attend this summer's Olympics in Paris because he didn't want to risk bringing Covid home to his wife during her cancer treatment. \"Wills Olympic virus fear\" says the Sun, while \"Prince missed Paris to keep Kate safe\" is the Times' take.\n\nHe made the comments yesterday while meeting some of Britain's Olympic and Paralympic swimmers.

    "'You\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it' - how John Prescott inspired Angela Rayner\n\nJohn Prescott, who has died aged 86, was a figurehead of New Labour, who was also instinctively sceptical of some of its instincts. He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off. His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre. He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together. It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer. Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged. Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC, external: \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\" She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\" Speaking to broadcasters after news of his death, Rayner said he had been \"a huge support to me ever since I came into politics\", offering the advice to \"be authentically yourself and keep thinking about the people you\u2019re there to represent\". She added: \"That\u2019s what he always said to me, 'you\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it'\".\n\nBoth left school with few qualifications and worked their way up through the union movement, before entering politics. And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use. Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them. And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for. The old jibe that all politicians look and sound the same could never apply to Prescott or Rayner. Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life. For all the talk about how he was the authentic working class grit in the smooth, polished very middle class New Labour, that sense of his class \u2013 \u201cbottom class\u201d as he put it \u2013 and others was a huge part of how he saw himself, and how he saw others. If you have a moment today, I recommend listening to this wonderful documentary on BBC Sounds \u2013 Prescott At Your Service - which tells the story of a 19-year-old John Prescott working as a waiter on an ocean liner to New Zealand, where the future deputy prime minister would serve the recently resigned former prime minister Anthony Eden. Decades later, Tony Blair would reflect that Prescott\u2019s own self image was an ever present in his daily interactions in government. \u201cHe could smell out condescension, a slight, an air of superiority or a snub at a thousand paces; and at once smelt, he could charge after it with quite shocking abandon.\u201d John Prescott was the conduit between Labour\u2019s past and its present. He was, as well, the glue binding Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, whose pivotal but at times dysfunctional relationship defined the first decade of Labour\u2019s stint in power between 1997 and 2010. And he illustrated a path to the near pinnacle of power for those whose backgrounds still rarely lead to the top table of British politics.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "US actor's dream to own ancestral home is in ruins\n\nHopwood DePree said he had spent seven years trying to realise his dream of owning his ancestral home\n\nA US actor's dream of restoring his ancestral home to its former glory has been left in ruins after the council that owns the 15th Century manor house pulled out of the deal. Hopwood DePree swapped Los Angeles for Rochdale in 2017 after discovering Grade II-listed Hopwood Hall in Middleton had been in his family for about 400 years. However, the 54-year-old, who said he had spent about \u00a3580,000 renovating the dilapidated 60-room country house, claimed Rochdale Borough Council had \"pulled the rug from under him\" by ending its agreement to sell it to him. The council said Mr DePree did not have a \"viable\" plan for the future of the building.\n\nMr DePree, who is originally from Michigan, said he had been told stories about Hopwood Hall by his grandfather when he was a boy. He had assumed the stories about the house - where Guy Fawkes and Lord Byron are reported to have stayed and which remained in the Hopwood family until World War One - were just fairy tales. But when he found out about the family connection he decided to try to buy the building and turn it into an arts and events centre. Rochdale Council gave him a \"limited licence to occupy\" and the option to buy the building. About \u00a31.7m in grants from the council and heritage bodies like Historic England have been invested in repairs and renovations since 2017.\n\nHopwood DePree said he had invested about \u00a3580,000 of his own money in reviving Hopwood Hall\n\nPlanning permission for Mr DePree's scheme was granted in 2022, the same year he wrote Downton Shabby, which chronicled his efforts to revive the manor. He said he believed he had viable plans for the future of the building, and had been talking to hotel and restaurant firms about his idea of running hospitality skills training there. But he was shocked to discover that, at a meeting held behind closed doors last week, the council had decided to back out of the arrangement.\n\nHopwood Hall has been derelict for much of the last 20 years\n\nMr DePree said under the council's ownership the building had been derelict for years. He said: \"The council took the hall over in the 1990s and in these last 20-plus years, it has fallen into complete dereliction, so for us to reverse that and restore the building to its former glory was an incredible challenge.\" Mr DePree, who directed and starred in the 1999 comedy The Last Big Attraction, said the council had told him that because the hall is completely surrounded by Hopwood Hall college's grounds, it needed its own independent access road. He said he had been looking into how to build that when the council decided it no longer wanted to go ahead with the deal. Mr DePree, who believed the deal to be legally binding, said he wanted details of the reason for the council's decision before deciding on his next move. But his lawyers have said they believe the council should honour the agreement to sell because, they said, the only condition was that planning permission was secured.\n\nAn artist's impression of how the Long Gallery at Hopwood Hall might look after renovation\n\nRochdale Borough Council said it had agreed to sell the building to Mr DePree for a \"nominal fee\" if he could come up with a viable business plan, and had renewed and extended the agreement several times. But this week the cabinet had decided not to renew it again after consultants it commissioned said Mr DePree's plans were \"unlikely to be able to secure future public or private funding\".

    "Eva Longoria says her family no longer lives in 'dystopian' US\n\nThe Desperate Housewives star is considered a power broker in Democratic politics\n\nHollywood actress Eva Longoria has revealed that her family no longer lives in the United States, and is splitting time between Mexico and Spain. In an interview with French magazine Marie Claire for its November cover story, Longoria attributed the decision to the country's \"changing vibe\" after the Covid-19 pandemic, homelessness and high taxation in California, and the re-election of Donald Trump. She also acknowledged she was \"privileged\" enough to move, saying: \u201cMost Americans aren\u2019t so lucky.

    "Rape centre breaks away from charity in row over gender\n\nA rape support centre in Glasgow has broken away from the supervision of the umbrella charity Rape Crisis Scotland in a row over gender. Glasgow and Clyde Rape Crisis said its priority was to provide a single-sex service by an \"all-female workforce\" - and this was \"at odds\" with the charity's priorities. RCS chief executive Sandy Brindley recently apologised after another centre in Edinburgh, which was run by a trans woman, failed to provide single-sex spaces for 16 months. At the time Ms Brindley made clear that all member centres should provide single-sex spaces, but said there was no reason why transgender people could not work in rape support centres.\n\nBBC News understands the Glasgow centre made the decision in February to end its membership with Rape Crisis Scotland (RCS) - the national charity that sets service standards for member centres. The centre then held a number of meetings with RCS to discuss concerns - its view was it wanted to go beyond providing single-sex spaces and have a women-only workforce. Katie Cosgrove, co-chair of Glasgow and Clyde Rape Crisis, said the centre was not changing the way its service is run - rather that the decision was to \"publicly disassociate\" from RCS. Asked what the impact of the move would be on service users, she said she was \"not clear on what kind of impact that might be\". She said she recognised there was a need for trans women to use the service and that the centre had seen a \"small number\" of trans women - 17 in the last year. A condition of the charity's funding from the Scottish government is that services are trans-inclusive. The Glasgow centre will continue to support trans women who seek support but will not employ trans women. Ms Cosgrove said: \"We believe very strongly in the rights of women to have single-sex services within a rape crisis setting and we believe, to ensure that they are protected and that risk is minimised, that it should be an all-female workforce.\" Under updated guidance, external from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, that was published earlier this year, the definition of women only can include trans women who have a gender recognition certificate (GRC). However, it is legal to prevent trans women \u2013 including those with a GRC - from applying for a women-only role if it is a \u201cproportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\u201d. RCS said it wished the Glasgow team well. It said member centres deliver services in a variety of ways tailored to the needs of communities. A spokesperson added: \u201cAll Rape Crisis Centres must provide women-only spaces within their service but how they define this is currently for individual centres to decide. \"Rape Crisis Centres can provide single-sex spaces within Rape Crisis Scotland \u2013 and many do.\"\n\nEarlier this year a review found that Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre (ERCC) had failed to provide women-only spaces and that its CEO - a trans woman named Mridul Wadhwa - had not acted professionally or understood the limits of her authority. The report also said there was \"evidence that the actions of some ERCC staff had caused damage to some survivors\", and that concerns had been raised that some women were \"excluding themselves from approaching Rape Crisis Centres including ERCC\" because of their approach to gender identity. Ms Brindley found out ERCC was not following national standards last October and paused referrals 11 months later when the review said safeguarding was a problem. The review recommended RCS facilitate a \"shared approach\" across its centres - the charity said this work was under way.\n\nSandy Brindley is the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland - the umbrella charity which sets standards for member support centres\n\nGroups including For Women Scotland, which has campaigned against changes to transgender rights, accused the ERCC board of \"ignoring its own culpability\". The review was commissioned by RCS after an employment tribunal found in May of this year that a counsellor - Roz Adams - had been unfairly constructively dismissed. This was over her belief that people who used the service should be able to know the sex of the staff that would be dealing with their case. Ms Wadhwa was highlighted in the tribunal outcome as she appeared to believe that Ms Adams was transphobic. Ms Brindley stressed that Rape Crisis Scotland had no involvement in hiring Ms Wadhwa - who stood down from her role after the review was published. However she said there had been \"no reason\" not to agree with the appointment at the time as Ms Wadhwa had significant experience of working in the sector. The role Ms Wadhwa had is reserved for women only.\n\nMridul Wadhwa became chief executive of the Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre in 2021\n\nSince the controversy emerged, Ms Brindley has faced pressure from some groups to stand down, including from Scottish Conservative MSP Sue Webber. The BBC understands she still has the full support of the RCS board to remain in post. Ms Brindley told BBC News: \"I don\u2019t expect to be in post beyond the next 12 months but I definitely don\u2019t intend to resign just now - we've got so many important things to do.\" The chief executive previously described how the controversy had led to rape survivors who supported RCS experiencing \"horrendous\" abuse online, including being told that they \"must be lying\" about being raped. \"It is absolutely astonishing to me that this is the position we're in where rape survivors can be treated in this way in the name of women's rights supposedly,\" she said. RCS oversees 17 support centres across Scotland which offer support to men, women, transgender and non-binary people.",

We're here to win world championships - McLaren's Brown\n\nFormula 1 needs to employ stewards on a full-time basis in order to simplify the rules of the sport, says Zak Brown. The McLaren chief executive officer thinks current rules are \"overly regulated\" and \"overly complicated\". Brown has suggested paying stewards, who are currently unpaid volunteers, and giving them access to more technology in order to make the right calls on high-profile incidents. This season, McLaren's Lando Norris has been involved in back-to-back controversial track battles with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with the pair being penalised for separate incidents at the United States and Mexico City Grands Prix. \"I think we need full-time stewards,\" Brown told BBC Sport. \"I don't think the way we're set up as a sport, we are set up for success.\" Verstappen made similar comments to BBC Sport on Thursday, saying: \"Do I think consistency in the penalties could be better? Yes, for sure, but that only comes with stewards that are paid - professional stewards. \"The stewards we have right now, they are doing their very best to what they have but in a sport like this, like in other sports, when you have a paid board of stewards, it works way better.\u201d\n\nIn Austin, Norris was given a five-second penalty for going off the track and gaining an advantage trying to overtake Verstappen. The Briton refused to give the place back after Verstappen complained, highlighting he had been ahead at the apex. The stewards, however, disagreed with Norris. Many drivers made it clear they felt Verstappen\u2019s driving was not fair in Austin and told the FIA that the racing guidelines needed changing to address the type of tactics the Dutchman had employed. A week later in Mexico, the two drivers clashed again, with Verstappen being given a combined 20-second penalty for two incidents with Norris on the same lap. Norris called Verstappen's driving \"dangerous\" and flagged again that he was ahead of the three-time world champion into the corner during the first tussle. \"I think we need to take a step back and not over-regulate what happens on the track. We never used to do that in Formula 1,\" said Brown. \"I think we\u2019re racing too much to a rulebook now versus good old fashioned racing - just give the stewards a little bit more discretion. They\u2019ve raced, they know that a driver has been pushed off or not, or made a lunge, or not. And not have this black and white rulebook.\" However, Brown says he does have confidence in the governing body's president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, following the departures of senior members of FIA staff in the past year. Race director Niels Wittich, a replacement for Michael Masi in 2022, left his role with immediate effect on 12 November, with less than a month of the season remaining. Wittich was said to have \"stepped down\" but he told BBC Sport last week: \"I can confirm that I got fired and it was not my decision to leave F1.\" The German has been replaced from this weekend's Las Vegas Grand Prix by Rui Marques. \"He doesn't mess about. He makes decisions,\" Brown said of Ben Sulayem. \"I think we were surprised by that decision, more the timing of it.\" McLaren are top of the constructors' standings by 36 points with three races remaining and Brown says \"it would be unbelievable\" if the team could secure their first team title since 1998. \"It's hard to believe it was that long ago,\" he added. \"That's why we're here. We're here to win world championships.\"",

    "King Hamad received a Royal Salute from a Guard of Honour at Windsor Castle on Monday\n\nHuman rights activists have criticised an honorary knighthood given to King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, who visited the UK earlier this week. In a letter to Buckingham Palace, three Bahraini activists now living in exile called on King Charles to rescind the Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, describing the award as a \u201cbetrayal\". They cited what they called the \u201carbitrary imprisonment, brutal torture, unfair trials, and arbitrary executions of innocent individuals\". A spokesman for Bahrain's government said it \"firmly rejects these baseless claims which overlook the substantial progress the Kingdom has achieved in advancing individual rights and the rule of law\".\n\n\"We remain committed to continued reforms and welcome constructive dialogue to address any legitimate concerns fairly and transparently,\" they added. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both also expressed concern. \u201cYou have to wonder what signal this sends when the Bahraini authorities are unjustly prosecuting their critics, when human rights defenders are languishing in Bahraini jails and when the Manama authorities refuse to reinstate the citizenship of people rendered stateless on politically motivated charges,\u201d said Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of government and political relations. The award given to King Hamad as well as King Abdullah of Jordan \u2013 who are both marking silver jubilees this year \u2013 was announced on Wednesday by Buckingham Palace. It is not commenting on the criticism. Bahrain and the UK have strong diplomatic, political and military relations. On Monday, King Hamad arrived in a horse and carriage at Windsor Castle, receiving a Royal Salute from a Guard of Honour. A \u201cspectacular evening\u201d followed which ended with pipers marching around the dinner table, according to the British ambassador to Bahrain, Alastair Long, on Instagram. He said that King Charles, addressing the Bahraini monarch, had praised him for being \u201cguided by his concern and care for his people.\u201d King Hamad, a Sunni Muslim, rules a country with a Shia majority, and members of his family hold the main political and military positions. In 2011, pro-democracy protests were crushed, with the help of troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this year, hundreds of political prisoners were freed after they were granted a royal pardon to mark 25 years of King Hamad\u2019s rule. But many remain in jail, including human rights activist Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, 63, and 76-year-old opposition leader Hassan Mushaima, the fathers of two of the signatories to the letter to King Charles - Maryam Al-Khawaja and Ali Mushaima. The third signatory, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei - who is now a British citizen - said he had been beaten, tortured and jailed for calling for peaceful change. \u201cThroughout King Hamad\u2019s rule, scores of Bahrainis have been arbitrarily detained and tortured, and some have even been killed as a result of exercising their rights to assembly and free expression,\u201d Niku Jafarnia of Human Rights Watch told the BBC. \u201cThe recent pardons he\u2019s given don\u2019t make up for these abuses, and it\u2019s a disgrace that he has been granted this award while many still remain wrongfully detained,\u201d she said.",
    "Donald Trump landed his historic second United States presidency thanks to small increases in support - but lots of them, reaching across the country. Votes are still being counted, but a picture is emerging of what tipped the balance in Trump's favour. They include small but widespread gains from many sources. The map below shows in red the states where Trump won. Kamala Harris's victories are shown in blue.\n\nYou need a modern browser with javascript enabled to view the interactive content in this page.\n\nThe swing towards Trump happened across the country, as shown in the county level map below, although counting continues in many states especially in the west. Harris led by tens of thousands of votes in major cities. But Trump dominated the rural counties that lie between them. His wins may not appear to be as sizeable, but they are pervasive. And those margins add up.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden turned many of Pennsylvania's counties Democrat blue - particularly those near the eastern city of Philadelphia. In 2024, voters seem to have reversed their positions as more votes in the eastern parts of the state went to Trump. Around Georgia\u2019s major metropolis of Atlanta, votes for Harris were higher than for Biden. But almost everywhere else went further red, the colour of the Republican party, and this picture could become clearer as more votes are tallied. In Wisconsin, Trump won by less than one percentage point - about 30,000 votes at latest count.\n\nIt is difficult to identify a single group or area in the state that moved the needle towards Trump. His share of the vote increased by less than 5% in all but a handful of counties across the state, compared with 2020. If you look at the map below the change is almost imperceptible.\n\nHarris did well in the traditional Democratic urban strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison; voters came out for her in large numbers. Yet it was Trump\u2019s small but widespread gains in counties across the state that did the trick.\n\nTrump has taken Nevada, the first Republican win in the western battleground since 2004. In the vote tally so far, there has been little change among the largest groups of voters. Black voters chose Harris in similar numbers as they did Biden, while white voters maintained their support for Trump. Yet the exit poll suggested Trump saw a substantial increase in support among Hispanic and Asian voters, with Harris losing ground compared with Biden four years ago. Trump raised his share among Hispanic voters in Nevada by 13 points compared with 2020, which meant he and Harris ended up in a tie, both securing 48% of that vote.\n\nHe also enjoyed a very substantial swing among Nevada\u2019s Asian voters, from 35% in 2020 to 50% in 2024. While the Asian community accounts for just 4% of voters surveyed, we\u2019ve seen how similarly small shifts made the difference elsewhere.\n\nWhile the picture in the states that flipped will become clearer in the coming days, we can see some emerging trends on how different groups of people voted across the nation from US exit polls. These cut across demographic groups and regions. On immigration and the economy, Trump was seen as the overwhelming favourite among voters for whom either was the most important issue.\n\nFor voters who felt strongly about abortion or the state of democracy, three-quarters or more voted for Harris. This suggests a stark difference in priorities across the two groups of voters. Both campaigns emphasised these diverging issues in recent weeks, and it\u2019s clear the messaging cut through. The personalities of the candidates themselves may also have played a role in how ballots were cast. For those looking for a presidential candidate who would \u201cbring needed change\u201d to the country, a large majority voted for Trump. And two-thirds of those who most valued leadership skills did the same.\n\nA large majority of Harris voters chose her because they felt she had good judgement and \u201ccared about people like me\u201d. But the desire for change can be a powerful force when it comes to the way voters choose to cast their ballot.",
    "Between 2001 and 2006 Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 150 goals in 219 games for Manchester United\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy has left Manchester United after not being given a role in new manager Ruben Amorim's backroom staff. The 48-year-old Dutchman took over at Old Trafford on an interim basis after compatriot Erik ten Hag was sacked. Van Nistelrooy, who joined United as an assistant coach in July on a two-year deal, managed three victories and a draw in his four games during his time as caretaker boss. However, Amorim has decided against retaining the services of former Netherlands striker Van Nistelrooy, who spent five seasons at United as a player. \"Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend,\" the club said in a statement which confirmed Van Nistelrooy's exit. \"We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.\" United confirmed that fellow coaches Rene Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel have also left the club. However, former United midfielder Darren Fletcher will remain in his coaching role and continue his link between the first team and the academy. United said they will \"confirm the full men's first-team coaching composition\" under the new Portuguese boss \"in due course\".\n\nNew Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim and chief executive Omar Barrada embrace at Manchester United's training ground\n\nAmorim was appointed on a two-and-a-half-year deal earlier this month and flew into the UK from Lisbon on Monday afternoon having completing his stint as Sporting boss. He was met at United's Carrington training ground by United chief executive Omar Barrada and given a tour of the facilities. The 39-year-old has 13 days during the international break to prepare for his first match in charge of United, away against Ipswich in the Premier League on 24 November.\n\nThis is not the most surprising news but some fans will greet it with disappointment. Ruud van Nistelrooy made it clear he had a contract to remain as assistant manager until June 2026 and wanted to see it through. However, Ruben Amorim has his own long-established coaching team and there is no space in it for someone who has vast experience of Manchester United and managerial ambitions of his own. It could be argued United might have given Van Nistelrooy time to make a claim on the job himself but chief executive Omar Berrada knew who he wanted to replace Erik ten Hag so the decision was moot. However, Van Nistelrooy has impressed inside and out of the club over the last four games, so who knows what might happen in the future. Interestingly though, former United midfielder Darren Fletcher will remain in his role and continue his link between the first team and the academy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

    "Popular London nightclub Heaven has been closed on public safety grounds after a rape was reported, the Metropolitan Police said. The force successfully applied to Westminster Council to suspend the licence of the Villiers Street venue until a full hearing can take place. In an initial hearing on Friday, the council was told a woman was allegedly raped in the vicinity of the venue by a member of security staff on 1 November. The Met said a member of security staff was arrested and charged with rape, and is on remand in prison. The suspension will take effect immediately, the Met said, meaning Heaven will be closed from Friday night onwards.\n\nThe hearing was told that when the woman tried to report the attack, other staff allegedly ignored her. A council spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing a request from the Metropolitan Police, and considering evidence from both the police and the operator, the council\u2019s licensing committee has decided to suspend Heaven\u2019s licence for 28 days. \u201cWe recognise this venue\u2019s cultural significance but the committee agreed this step is necessary to prevent serious crime and protect the public. \u201cA full licensing hearing will be held in December where both the police and venue management will have the opportunity to present new evidence. \"This case is currently subject of an ongoing police investigation, and we are unable to comment further at this stage.\" Heaven posted on Instagram to say: \"We are sickened by this allegation but can't comment as it is an on going criminal investigation.

Mary \u2018Pat\u2019 Thompson was receiving personal care at Rose Lodge Nursing home in Lisburn on 18 May 2020 when she was left sitting unattended on her bed. The 89 year old suffered multiple injuries when she fell forwards onto the floor. She died days later in hospital. The care home's previous owner, Harmony CCS Limited, which is based in Belfast, was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to a single health and safety breach.\n\nIn a statement, the company said its directors wished to express their \"sincere apologies\" to Mrs Thompson's family, adding that their \"deepest sympathies\" are with the family. \"Pat was a lovely person and a much loved resident and we remain deeply sorry and saddened by the incident,\" the statement added.\n\nThe accident was investigated by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI). It found that Mrs Thompson had care plans in place which indicated she required the assistance of two carers in order to stay safe while being moved. However, the care plans provided no formal indication about the level of assistance Mrs Thompson required while she was having personal care. On the day of the fall, a junior staff member was directed by a senior staff member to provide personal care for Mrs Thompson on her own. \"As a result, Mrs. Thompson was moved by one carer and left unattended at the edge of the bed from which she fell,\" a HSENI statement said. Speaking after the court hearing, HSENI inspector Kiara Blackburn said: \u201cCare plans must identify the specific care needs of each resident and should be followed by all care staff.\"\n\nThe current owners of Rose Lodge Nursing Home, who purchased the home in 2021, after the incident took place, said in a statement that they wished \"to express their sympathy for the family\" of Mrs Thompson.",
    "England have lost three straight home matches for the first time since 2006\n\nJack van Poortvliet has been here before. Two years ago, as England's scrum-half huddled up under the posts, his face flashed up on Twickenham's big screens. New Zealand flanker Dalton Papali'i had just picked off his pass and cantered in to give New Zealand a seven-point head start. This time around it was a kick. Eben Etzebeth, looming like a skyscraper, had charged down Van Poortvliet to give South Africa a freebie try and puncture England's promising start. It will have felt like all his fault. It wasn't. England's forwards left him unprotected and vulnerable. Marcus Smith, his fly-half, had his own chance to clear and similarly found a South African torso. And, ultimately, the errors added up. For all England's unquestionable courage and energy, they have continually been undermined by mistakes this autumn. The foundations of a promising team always seem to be subsiding under their own slip-ups. They have come in all different matches, in all different guises, from all areas of the team. Against New Zealand, the crossed wires and fumbled drop-goal routine between Harry Randall and George Ford was most obvious. Against Australia, England's failure to secure a kick-off \u2013 Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii disrupting Maro Itoje \u2013 on the last play was key. But so was a botched midfield move that gave Andrew Kellaway a walk-in. Against South Africa, Ben Earl missed a vital tackle on Damian de Allende, before England's faint hopes of crowbarring their way to a comeback were dashed by Luke Cowan-Dickie's twitchy line-out throw and Itoje picking, not going and being caught at the back of a promising breakdown. Those are individual moments, perhaps the most glaring ones. But you could pick plenty more. After three straight home defeats for the first time since 2006, the spotlight certainly shouldn't shine on Van Poortvliet alone. It must also extend to the sidelines to take in selections and systems.\n\nVan Poortvliet's inclusion was the latest scrum-half shuffle in the absence of the injured Alex Mitchell. Ben Spencer went from first choice to third string in the space of a week. Randall, who started the majority of England's games in the 2022 Six Nations, does not seem trusted to do so now. Stepping back in to start against the world champions, after more than a year out of the Test rugby, was therefore the stretch asked of Van Poortvliet. The midfield combination of Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade \u2013 which seemed one of the most settled parts of England's side before the autumn \u2013 hasn't mustered much punch over the last three games. Tactically, England were set up to exploit their height advantage on the wing. On the turf, it never worked out that way. Instead the scorching pace and side-stepping brilliance of Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse was decisive. More generally, England came up short in the final quarter once more. Playing against 14 for half of it, they failed to score a single point. Across 2024, they have conceded 30 more points than they have scored after the hour mark. Whether it is fitness, lack of tactical finesse or a shortage of bench strength, the fade is real. In attack, Plan A was to lean heavily and hopefully on Marcus Smith to produce a moment of magic. It doesn't seem to progress much further through the alphabet.\n\nMarcus Smith carried 12 times from fly-half, with only number eight Ben Earl doing so more for England against South Africa\n\nAnd in defence, they have conceded an average of 32 points a game so far this autumn, letting in 12 tries in three matches. When it comes to sorting these problems little is made easier by an environment that chews through coaches at an alarming rate. England needed to be spotless to make up a chasm in class and form on South Africa. In Paris, in last year's Rugby World Cup semi-final, they very nearly were. On Saturday though, the blemishes were obvious and plentiful - and this autumn they seem to be setting in, rather than shifting. A bad day in the office seems to have become the standard. Against a ragged Japan, even an error-strewn England should be good enough. They saw off the Brave Blossoms by 35 points in the summer. Whatever mind games and inside information Eddie Jones has is unlikely to stop a repeat defeat for Japan. One win would be scant return from an autumn that promised more however. And all the time, the Six Nations, renewed rivalries with the northern hemisphere's best and fears England are just not as good as we thought, lurk like Etzebeth around a breakdown.",
    "Workers at Meta have reportedly been sacked for abusing the tech firm's meal voucher system, such as using it to buy toothpaste and washing powder. Other breaches of the policy included sharing the vouchers with others or going over budget, according to people who said they work at Meta. There are differing accounts over how much warning, if any, the owner of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp gave the workers before firing them. Separately, the company has reportedly cut jobs across the business. Meta has been contacted for comment.\n\nMeta staff are given $25 (\u00a319) for lunch, $20 for breakfast, and $25 for dinner in vouchers which are meant to be used for ordering food from Grubhub, the US name for takeaway website Just Eat. Posts on anonymous work social message board Blind appear to confirm elements of the story, originally reported by the Financial Times. One user wrote that more than 30 people were fired last week because they used the credits for \"non-food items, shared credits with people, or went above budget\". Examples of the non-food items bought included toothpaste, toothbrushes and wine glasses. \"They were given a warning to stop which most of them did, but were still fired three months later even after stopping,\" the user said. Some repeated the claim the staff were warned, though other users wrote that there were no warnings. Separately, the company has also reportedly made job cuts at WhatsApp, Instagram and Reality Labs, its virtual reality business responsible for the Oculus headset. These cuts are not related to the issues surrounding the voucher system. Jane Manchun Wong, a former security engineer at Meta, said on Wednesday that she had lost her job as part of these wider layoffs. \"I\u2019m still trying to process this but I\u2019m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ms Wong was hired just over a year ago as a software engineer after making 2022's Forbes 30 under 30 list. The layoffs were first reported by Verge, with a spokesperson telling the tech publication: \"A few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\"",

Southampton 'are one of the best in the Premier League' - Pep Guardiola\n\nSouthampton were beaten at Manchester City, as most people expected. They are bottom of the Premier League, with a single point from their first nine games of the season. Manager Russell Martin is under pressure, despite guiding Saints back to the top flight only five months ago. Speaking to the media after Saturday's 1-0 result, both managers heaped praise on the beaten team. It was not so much that they were unlucky to lose. If Erling Haaland had a better day, he would have scored more than just the fifth-minute match-winner. Manchester City beat Southampton in an open game - not just because they found a way through a blanket defence. Towards the end of the first half, the visitors had the majority of possession. It was down to 42.3% by the end. As a guide, City\u2019s previous two opponents, Sparta Prague and Wolves, have had 20.1% and 22.4% respectively. If Southampton are to go down, or Martin is to lose his job, it will be by committing to a gameplan he believes in. \"I took the job [at MK Dons] nearly five years ago, with the club in the League One relegation zone and the chairman saying he didn't care if they got relegated if he could see something he believed in and could be proud of,\" said Martin. \"There have been some moments of real difficulty at MK and Swansea and here, where you get questioned and have to make a big decision. \"But if I end up losing my job at some point, which is inevitable, at least I can say I have stuck to what I want to be, as a person first, then a leader and then as a manager. \"To get to the Premier League and then change would be illogical. I cannot stand on the sidelines watching something I don't feel connected with or love. I don't see the point in that.\" That requires Southampton's players to have courage to take the ball in tight areas, carry on passing when the pressure is at its greatest and not allow poor results or adversity to change that mindset.\n\nSouthampton manager Russell Martin was praised by counterpart Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's 1-0 win at Etihad Stadium\n\nThe circumstances are significantly different - given the size of the club he was going into, and the knowledge he could call on generational talents in Xavi and Andres Iniesta, and the man he regards as the greatest ever in Lionel Messi - but Pep Guardiola needed to do something similar when he was given the Barcelona job, aged 37 - a year younger than Martin is now. Now revered as one of the greatest managers in history, Guardiola appreciates what Martin is doing and even feels there are aspects of Southampton's play he can learn from. \"We were not sloppy, we were not flat, but we struggled to regain the ball because they are really good,\" said the City boss. \"I'm a spectator. I prefer the players to get the ball to feet, not the teeth. \"When I see the opponent do the things I like to do with my team and they do it really well, I make a compliment. \"I'm sure I will learn, there were some movements, the reasons why they do things, the movements they make to link to the striker. It's not easy.\u201d He added on Sky Sports: \"It's a good game to learn as a manager. I am going to learn a lot with Russell because they did really well.\" Guardiola did not just praise Martin to the media, he also spoke to the Saints boss straight after the final whistle - and Martin revealed City and England playmaker Phil Foden had also done so. \"They felt we were really brave with the ball and did stuff not many teams do,\" said Martin. \"It is not easy to play that way but he probably understands it more than anyone. \"I have seen so many teams promoted and get nowhere. If we lose I can accept it when the lads show a level of courage like they did today. If they do that here they can do it anywhere. \"I will live and die by the sword for what I believe in. If we keep playing like we did today we will have some fun and be all right.\" Fun might be an extreme way of describing Southampton's current predicament. Pressure can scramble the mind and - after throwing away a victory against Ipswich in injury time and losing a two-goal lead in the final half-hour against Leicester - the forthcoming games against Everton and Wolves look huge for Martin and his side's survival hopes. If the former Scotland international can really have fun in games like that, he deserves all the success that comes his way.",
    "Fly-halves Marcus (left) and Fin (right) Smith are among 17 England players to receive new deals with the Rugby Football Union\n\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick has named a group of 17 players that will receive English rugby\u2019s first Enhanced Elite Player Squad contracts. Fly-halves George Ford, Marcus Smith and Fin Smith have been given one of the deals but there are no tighthead props in the group. Bath\u2019s Sam Underhill is a surprise omission having started all of England\u2019s eight Test matches in 2024. The contracts - the first of their kind - allow Borthwick to have the final say on all sports science and medical matters in relation to the players, handing the England boss unprecedented influence compared to his predecessors. \"I am confident that these contracts, and our strong relationship with the Premiership clubs, will play a significant role in England Rugby\u2019s continued development,\" he said. Northampton\u2019s Alex Mitchell is the only scrum-half in the 17, with Ellis Genge the only loosehead prop, while Sale flanker Tom Curry has been handed an Enhanced Contract despite his long injury lay-off. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has capped off a breakthrough year by being included in the group, while Henry Slade has also been given a contract despite not making the 2023 Rugby World Cup squad. Flanker Chandler Cunningham-South started England\u2019s three Test matches on their summer tour, but has been left out of the 17.\n\nAside from Genge and Curry, the other forwards to receive a contract are Ollie Chessum, Theo Dan, Ben Earl, Jamie George, Maro Itoje and George Martin, while Tommy Freeman, George Furbank and Ollie Lawrence are the remaining backs. \"One of the aims of the new Men\u2019s Professional Game Partnership is to create world-leading English teams,\" added Rugby Football Union director of performance rugby Conor O\u2019Shea. \"We believe this new collaborative approach between club, country and the players can bring greater stability to English rugby, as well as supporting the growth and performance of the England men\u2019s team.\" A new player-led organisation called Team England Rugby negotiated the deal with the Rugby Football Union after the players broke away from their long-running arrangement with the Rugby Players Association earlier this year. The 17 players will now receive a salary from the RFU, of around \u00a3160,000 per year, rather than match fees of approximately \u00a323,000 per game.",
    "Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of sexually assaulting teenager in new lawsuits\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing new allegations of rape, sexual abuse and sexual assault after a series of fresh lawsuits were filed on Monday. At least six lawsuits were filed in New York federal court by two women and four men. They include allegations that span from 1995 to 2021. The unnamed accusers allege some of the assaults happened at Mr Combs' parties, which were attended by major celebrities and music artists. Lawyers for Mr Combs denied the allegations, saying in a statement to the BBC that he \"has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman\".\n\nOne of the accusers said he was 16 when he attended one of the parties in the Hamptons in 1998. In the lawsuit, he describes being thrilled to get an invitation to Mr Combs' party, which became a premier A-list annual event for celebrities. The accuser said he saw countless celebrities and music artists as he walked around, and ran into Mr Combs while he was on the way to the bathroom. He said he started talking to Mr Combs about breaking into the music industry when they went to somewhere more private. The accuser alleges that during their conversation, Mr Combs abruptly ordered him to undress. The lawsuit includes a photo of the pair together at the party with the teen's face blurred out. According to the lawsuit, Mr Combs said it was \u201ca rite of passage\u201d and \u201cthe route to becoming a star\". The rapper told the teen he could make anyone a star and the teen had the right \"look\", the lawsuit states.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Comb's parties were an annual tradition that attracted celebrities from Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber to Mariah Carey and the Kardashians\n\nAnother lawsuit filed on Monday includes allegations by a woman who claims Mr Combs raped her in a hotel room in 2004 when she was a 19-year-old college student. According to the lawsuit, she met the music mogul at a photoshoot, where he then invited her and a friend to attend a private party at his hotel. Once they arrived, the lawsuit alleges that Mr Combs \"fondled, molested, and ultimately raped her\u201d despite her repeatedly asking him to stop. Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee, who is representing the accusers, said he is representing more than 100 people who plan to sue the rapper on allegations of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Mr Buzbee said that some of the alleged victims include children. He said the lawsuits are being brought under the Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act, which allows victims to file older claims. \"We will let the allegations in the filed complaints speak for themselves, and will work to see that justice is done,\" Mr Buzbee said in a statement after filing the lawsuits Monday. \"We expect to be filing many more cases over the next several weeks naming Mr Combs and others as defendants as we continue to gather evidence and prepare the filings.\" The lawsuits are the latest of more than a dozen that have been filed against Mr Combs recently, accusing the music mogul of assaults, rape and sexual extortion. He has denied all civil and criminal claims against him. Mr Combs is facing federal criminal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. A judge last week tentatively scheduled his trial to begin on 5 May 2025. Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since his 16 September arrest. His lawyers have argued for his release until the trial, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. A New York federal judge denied their request for bail, arguing that Mr Combs was a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.",
    "North Korea says it will cut off all roads to the South\n\nRoads and railways leading from North Korea to the South are rarely used\n\nNorth Korea will sever road and railway access to South Korea from Wednesday in a bid to \u201ccompletely separate\u201d the two countries. Its military said the North would \u201cpermanently shut off and block the southern border\u201d and fortify areas on its side. The Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) described the move as \u201ca self-defensive measure for inhibiting war\u201d, claiming it was in response to war exercises in South Korea and the frequent presence of American nuclear assets in the region. It marks an escalation of hostility at a time when tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years.\n\n\u201cThe acute military situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula requires the armed forces of the DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] to take a more resolute and stronger measure in order to more creditably defend the national security,\u201d the KPA said in a report published by state media outlet KCNA. The declaration is a largely symbolic step by Pyongyang. Roads and railways leading from North Korea to the South are rarely used, and have been incrementally dismantled by North Korean authorities over the past year. It also comes amid a broader push by Pyongyang to change how it relates to the South, and follows a string of inflammatory incidents that have worsened relations between the two countries. Those incidents have ranged from missile tests to hundreds of trash balloons being sent over North Korea\u2019s southern border. Notably, North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un announced at the start of 2024 that he was no longer striving towards reunification with the South, raising concerns that war could resume in the Korean peninsula. \u201cI think it is necessary to revise some contents of the Constitution of the DPRK,\u201d Kim said at a meeting of North Korea\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Assembly (SPA) in January. \u201cIn my view, it is necessary to delete such expressions in the constitution as \u2018northern half\u2019 and \u2018independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity',\u201d he added, suggesting that the constitution should be revised \u201cat the next session\u201d. That next session was held this week, and concluded on Tuesday. Yet while many onlookers had expected Pyongyang to ratify Kim\u2019s earlier comments and make constitutional amendments to unification and border policies, no such changes were publicised. One analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification think tank suggested that Pyongyang could be waiting for the outcome of the US election before making any concrete decisions. Officials could \"consider adjusting the extent of constitutional revisions to align with the direction of the new (US) administration\", Hong Min told news agency AFP. It is unclear whether North Korea\u2019s decision to cut off all roads and railways linking it to the South was a result of discussions during the SPA session.",

    "Norris says he's 'not quite at Verstappen's level'\n\nLando Norris is 57 points behind leader Max Verstappen in the drivers' championship\n\nLando Norris says he is \"not quite at the level\" of title rival Max Verstappen when it comes to race-craft. The Briton was controversially penalised at Sunday's United States Grand Prix, demoting him from third to fourth behind Verstappen, for overtaking off track. Norris said: \"Max is the best in the world in this style of defence and attacking. So I have to be at his level and at the moment I am not quite at the level I need to be at. \"It's a shame to say, but it's probably the truth. At the same time, it's a chance for me to learn and progress.\" However, Norris said he did not believe he deserved the penalty and Verstappen's driving in the incident was \"not how racing should be\". McLaren have submitted a request for a right of review into Norris' penalty, with a hearing to take place in Mexico on Friday. They will need to demonstrate there is a \"significant and relevant new element\" for it to progress. Norris was among a number of drivers who questioned Verstappen's approach to the corner, essentially saying it complied with the rules, but was not fair racing. But in response, Verstappen said: \"It's how the rules are written. I don't make the rules. I just follow the rules as much as I can. I just implement the rules and play with them.\" Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton added: \"You shouldn't be able to come off the brakes and run more speed in and go off the track and still hold your place.\" The Mercedes driver felt a change had been needed for some time, and pointed out Verstappen had used the same tactic in their 2021 title fight. Hamilton's team-mate George Russell said he would ask the FIA whether, following a review, they believed Verstappen should have been penalised for his manoeuvre. \"In my view, he should have been penalised, therefore there isn't really a loophole,\" added the Briton. \"If they say he shouldn't have been, then he is exploiting a loophole. \"But he is in a title battle with Lando the same way as he was with Lewis and I don't think he would have done the same manoeuvre if it was any other driver, same as in Brazil 2021. It was a bit do or die, and he is happy to drive in that manner against his title rival, which I totally understand.\" Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, who won the race in Austin, said Verstappen's defence of his position from Norris was \"a bit too extreme\". Leclerc added the Dutchman \"has always been on the limit of the regulations and sometimes it goes over a little, but that's what makes those fights exciting\". Many drivers want to talk to governing body, the FIA, at this weekend's Mexico City Grand Prix about F1's rules on racing. Verstappen used these to his advantage in Austin in a move at Turn 12 in which Norris was trying to overtake him around the outside. The rules say if the driver on the inside has his front axle ahead of the car outside him at the apex of the corner, he does not need to give his rival any room on the exit. But a number of drivers feel Verstappen is exploiting that rule by braking so late that he complies with the regulation, but then goes off the track himself. Another rule says drivers are not allowed to force a rival off the track, but this was not applied in this case. Several drivers feel defending in that way makes it almost impossible to overtake Verstappen.\n\nNorris, who is 57 points behind the three-time world champion with five races to go and 146 available, said: \"The fact of getting off the brakes just to be ahead at apex, no matter how wide you run on the exit, is incorrect and I don't believe that's how racing should be. \"So I think there are some tweaks [that need making]. But Max races hard, I expect that. I just don't think I was in the wrong last weekend. I don't believe either of us were necessarily in the wrong. \"It's not that I believe he should have got a penalty and I shouldn't. I don't believe either of us should have got a penalty. \"The stewards have a tough job because every race is different. You have to understand the driver's mindset. He has nothing to lose, I have a lot to lose. So he can afford to take bigger risks than I can and that's just the unfortunate position I'm in at the moment.\" Asked whether the rules give too much incentive to brake late and have the front axle ahead of a rival's when defending a corner on the inside in the way Verstappen did, Leclerc added: \"It's a very complex subject. I don't have the right answer here. Common sense has to be applied in certain situations. \"When a driver does that multiple times in the same way\u2026we have to still create overtaking opportunities. What I have seen in Austin was maybe a bit too extreme.\" Williams driver Alex Albon felt there needed to be an addition to that specific rule that covers the scenario when both drivers go off track, as happened between Verstappen and Norris. \"It's tricky because he's still in control but he's still off the circuit,\" he said. \"So there probably needs to be some kind of sentence around, 'if you then end up going off the track yourself, there should be some kind of fall back or give back position'.\"",
    "Former Australia coach Darren Lehmann says Joe Root needs to score a century down under to be considered an \"all-time great\" alongside fellow batters Virat Kohli of India, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealander Kane Williamson.\n\nRoot has scored 35 Test centuries - the most for an England batter - but is yet to reach the milestone in an away Ashes series.\n\nHe has played 27 innings in Australia, averaging 35.68 and with a highest score of 89.\n\nLehmann was speaking after Australia were thrashed by 295 runs in the opening Test against India, with Kohli scoring his 30th Test ton overall and seventh in Australia.\n\n\"Nope, he is a rung below for that reason,\" said Lehmann on ABC Sport, when asked if Root was in the same category.\n\n\"They\u2019ve made runs all over the world in difficult conditions against different oppositions, and that's the only thing stopping Joe Root.

    "Emergency services were called to the care home in the early hours of Wednesday\n\nA woman has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the deaths of three people at a care home. Dorset Police said earlier the deaths at the Gainsborough Care Home in Swanage, were being treated as \"unexplained\" but potential carbon monoxide poisoning was the \"primary line of inquiry\". Emergency services were called to Gainsborough Care Home in Ulwell Road in Swanage, Dorset, at 05:20 BST. Seven people were taken to hospital and residents were evacuated from the building to a nearby church hall.\n\nPolice said a 60-year-old local woman had been detained on Wednesday evening. Det Ch Insp Neil Third said: \u201cAs part of our investigation, we have made one arrest to enable us to establish whether there have been actions or omissions which are grossly negligent and gather as much information as we can about what has happened. \"It is important to note that the arrest process also provides certain legal protection to individuals and I would ask for the media and public to avoid speculating any further now that legal proceedings are active.\" The force said earlier that the families of those who died have been informed and the coroner has been notified.\n\nEmergency services remained at the scene throughout the day as the investigation into the cause of the deaths continued\n\nAbout 40 residents from the home, run by Agincare, were seen being transferred, some in wheelchairs, to All Saints Church a short distance away. Dorset Council said it was working with the home and other agencies to support the residents of the care home. \"Many of the residents are vulnerable people with significant care needs, and so we are working with them to understand how to meet their needs in the short term and identify their next steps,\" it said on Wednesday. In an earlier statement, Agincare said it has allocated \"extra staffing resources\" to provide support after an incident at the site, and that residents moved to a village hall and church are \"safe and well\". They said: \"We appreciate that this is a stressful and worrying time for those involved, and have allocated extra staffing resources to provide support locally. We are contacting and updating residents' families. \"We will continue to work with the lead local authority services to return residents into their home at the earliest opportunity, and will provide further updates in due course.\"\n\nSouth West Ambulance NHS Trust said a hazardous area response team environment crew was sent to the scene along with 10 double-crewed ambulances. Fire crews from across Dorset were also deployed. They were assisted by a crew from Winchester in Hampshire. Gas distribution company SGN said it was called to Gainsborough Care Home earlier on Wednesday. It said engineers were sent to complete safety checks in the building. \"Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by this tragic incident,\" a statement said.\n\nDo you have a story BBC Dorset should cover?",
    "Behind the scenes of Heartstopper series three\n\nKit Connor and Joe Locke, who play Nick and Charlie, say their friendship means they support each other during difficult days of filming.\n\nOn a freezing cold November day in 2023, we\u2019re driving up to a school on the outskirts of London. It appears disused and unremarkable - but then a sign reading \u2018Truham High\u2019 gives the game away. This abandoned-looking building is actually the set of Netflix sensation Heartstopper, and on the day we visit, shooting for series three is well under way. The new episodes will be released on 3 October. Inside, the hustle and bustle you might expect in a school corridor has been replaced with the organised chaos of a film set. The plain school interior is covered with colourful murals painted in the style of Alice Oseman's graphic novels, which inspired the show. In the first two series it\u2019s been a safe space for Joe Locke\u2019s character, Charlie, to go to when he\u2019s having a hard time. During our visit he\u2019s joined by Kit Connor, who plays Nick - and the conversation they\u2019re filming looks difficult. They\u2019re sitting in a corner and speaking in hushed tones.\n\nHeartstopper is known for its colourful scenery, like Mr Ajayai's classroom, but the walls and corridors are painted over in between seasons so that other TV productions can use them\n\nWhile the producers are tight-lipped about the detail of what they\u2019re shooting, they do tell us \u201cit\u2019s quite an intense scene\u201d. They\u2019re protective over how many people are in the room with the actors during more emotional scenes. Dozens of silent crew members are crammed into a room next door, watching intently on monitors while the actors do several takes. The third series of the show deals with more serious topics than the first two; Charlie\u2019s eating disorder will be a key storyline, and some characters will be having sex for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said the show grows up with the characters, which is definitely the case this year,\" Locke says, speaking to us in a quick break before his next scene. \"The show deals with some more heavy topics like mental health, and growing up, so there\u2019s a lot of \u2018teenageness\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A major storyline for series three will focus on Charlie, played by Joe Locke, as he struggles with an eating disorder\n\nThe show has been praised for showcasing \u201cqueer joy\u201d - shining a light on the positive elements of growing up as part of the LGBTQ+ community - but Locke says it feels important to make sure it is still realistic. \u201cIt\u2019s all about authenticity, and trying to make your portrayal of a topic that is quite intense and quite close to people\u2019s hearts as true as possible,\u201d he says. Connor and Locke joked it was hard getting used to kissing your friend on camera, and with the actors all being so close, they admit some of the more passionate scenes can feel strange to film. Connor tells us: \u201cWhen you\u2019re shooting for seven-and-a-half hours as we did [for] a slightly steamier scene, it\u2019s like, what is my job?\u201d\n\nDuring our visit it\u2019s clear the cast members\u2019 chemistry goes beyond their time on-screen. Throughout our interviews they have in-jokes and gently make fun of each other, which Connor says helps with the more difficult days on set. \u201cAfter filming we all just sort of pile into someone\u2019s flat and spend time together, we have a great way of doing it where we don\u2019t talk about work or anything like that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all just go home, make dinner and criticise each other's cooking skills. \u201c[Joe Locke] actually cooked a good chilli this time\u2026 last time it was a very, very bad chilli. This time Will, who plays Tao, had seconds\u2026 but he will eat anything.\u201d\n\nKit Connor and Joe Locke, who play boyfriends Nick and Charlie, say it's hard getting used to kissing your friend on camera\n\nWhile the friendships might be real, some of the most iconic locations in the show are actually flat-packed and assembled inside the school, as and when required. During our visit, Nick\u2019s bedroom is assembled in what would have been the school\u2019s sports hall. There are no lights as no scenes are planned here today, so we explore using our phone torches instead. Even in the semi-darkness, the attention to detail is clear. From books about bisexuality, to Polaroid pictures of Nick and Charlie together, they\u2019ve gone to painstaking lengths to make the bedroom a true reflection of the character's journey throughout the series. \u201cThe fans really notice everything, and have theories about even the tiniest of details\u2026 you should see some of the TikToks they make,\u201d a member of the crew tells us.\n\nIt might not look like it from the outside, but this wooden box is actually Nick's bedroom in the show. Each set is built as and when needed in the school's sports hall\n\nJust down the corridor from Nick\u2019s flat-pack bedroom is the costume department, where designer Adam Dee says he likes giving mega-fans things to spot. \u201cIf they\u2019ve got a scene with an open wardrobe, [we\u2019ll] sneak in some iconic pieces from previous series so the audience can spot them,\" he says. \u201cWith Elle, she has a sewing station in her room, so we managed to add in some bits and pieces to her wardrobe that are made from two other items we\u2019ve sewed together, or vintage scarves we\u2019ve turned into tops.\u201d Heartstopper was somewhat of a surprise hit for Netflix, and series one launched with very little promotion. It became one of the top 10 most-watched English-language series within two days of its release and received an almost-unheard-of 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes - something many critics have put down to the diverse on-screen representation. Season three involves some of the show\u2019s older characters turning 16 and starting to have sex.\n\nSeason three will show the developing relationship between Elle and Tao (Yasmin Finney and William Gao)\n\nYasmin Finney\u2019s character, Elle, who is transgender, will be shown starting a sexual relationship with her on-screen boyfriend Tao (William Gao). The sex lives of transgender characters are often left out of TV storylines.

    "Students at Coleg y Cymoedd in Nantgarw say cuts to free bus travel will make college \"unaffordable\" in the future\n\nWelsh councils are facing \"unsustainable\" budget pressures over the next few years according to the body which represents them. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said funding shortfalls could \"significantly impact\" councils\u2019 ability to deliver essential services. The BBC has identified a budget shortfall of at least \u00a3540m across Wales by 2026-27. The Welsh government said it meets local authorities \"regularly\" to discuss the \"very real challenges they face\" ahead of its draft budget in December.\n\nRhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil councils are planning to withdraw funding for some school transport, and Caerphilly council is currently consulting on proposals to do so., external From September 2026 Merthyr will no longer fund over-16s to travel to college outside of the council area, apart from those attending Welsh medium or faith schools. The changes in RCT will be introduced from September 2025, and students who study at college Coleg y Cymoedd\u2019s campus in Nantgarw said the change will have a big impact on future students\u2019 ability to attend the college. Seventeen-year-old Cavan Griffin, who lives in Rhydyfelin, said the local school sixth form has recently closed, meaning that young people wanting to do A-levels have to travel. \"I\u2019m working a job\" he said, \"but I couldn\u2019t keep up every day paying for a bus back and forth to college.\"\n\nHis classmate Abi Meredith agreed: \"If you\u2019re going to make people within that radius pay, they\u2019re not going to come to college.\" Fellow A-level student Alfie Warner already walks because he lives within two miles (3.2km) of the Nantgarw campus and it takes him about half an hour each way. He said it\u2019s a challenge in the winter, adding: \"It limits you sometimes for after school clubs because you just want to get home.\" Coleg y Cymoedd\u2019s principal, Jonathan Morgan said around a thousand students could be affected by the proposed changes in the three councils' policies. He said 42% of learners at the college come from families where the household income is below \u00a323,000 a year. \"To push further costs onto those families by making them self-fund transport is for me a step too far,\" said Mr Morgan.\n\nRCT council said its school transport policy remained more generous than many other Welsh councils, but it \"had to make difficult decisions to ensure that services continue to be delivered in a financially sustainable way\". Caerphilly council said its \"transport budget is under significant financial pressure\" and it would \"fully consider the views of the community\" before agreeing any changes in future. Merthyr Tydfil council said the changes had been approved after \"significant discussion\" as part of \"the efficiency savings needed with the authority\".\n\nSimon Knoyle says Neath Port Talbot council is trying to prioritise vulnerable residents\n\nThere are some services which local authorities are legally bound to provide, like education and social services care for children and older people. But as budget pressures have grown, many have cut back on other services which they do not have a legal duty to give. Neath Port Talbot council has a predicted deficit of nearly \u00a3160 per person by 2026-27, and the cabinet member for finance, Simon Knoyle, warned the next few years look \"bleak\". He said: \"The last two years have already seen us take almost \u00a345m out of the base budget through efficiency measures and cuts.\" But Mr Knoyle said the council was trying to prioritise vulnerable residents.\n\nAllison Southall's team help Neath Port Talbot residents claim an additional \u00a310.5m in benefits last year\n\nIt recently expanded its welfare rights team which helps people to claim benefits they\u2019re entitled to. Allison Southall manages the team, which is part funded by the Welsh government, and said she helped 3,400 people claim an extra \u00a310.5m last year. \"Any reduction in funding would have a huge impact on the service we\u2019re able to provide, bearing in mind we\u2019ve got a current case load of about 750 people,\" she said. With the UK government Budget due at the end of October and the Welsh government draft budget following in December, the WLGA is calling on both governments \"to step up and provide the investment we need to keep these essential services running\".\n\nThe Welsh government said it recognised \"the very real challenges local authorities are facing\". \"We meet regularly with local authorities to discuss these against the backdrop of the current financial climate, as we prepare our own draft budget,\" a spokesperson said. The UK government said that funding councils in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh government, and it is \"committed to working with them to achieve the best possible funding for local councils in Wales\".",
    "Why did Hamilton struggle when Russell was competitive?\n\nMax Verstappen climbed up from 17th to claim a stunning victory at a heavily rain-affected Sao Paulo Grand Prix, as he took what seems to be a decisive grip on the drivers' championship. Alpine duo Esteban Ocon and Pierre Galsy joined him on the podium, while it was a difficult race for Verstappen's title rival Lando Norris, who could only finish sixth. BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Sao Paulo.\n\nRain is the great equaliser of talent and cars; just how great among history is Max Verstappen in the rain? That was imperious, another class. \u2013 Nick Any ranking of great wet-weather wins is inevitably subjective, but there are a handful held up as the very best, and it really does feel as if Verstappen in Sao Paulo on Sunday should be added to the list. The candidates are well known to Formula 1 aficionados:\n\u2022 None Jim Clark winning by almost five minutes, and lapping all but second-placed Jack Brabham, at Spa in Belgium in 1963\n\u2022 None Jackie Stewart winning by four minutes in fog and rain at the Nurburgring in 1968\n\u2022 None Ayrton Senna\u2019s stunning win at the 1993 European Grand Prix at Donington Park, lapping all but second-placed Damon Hill after doing five pit stops in the changeable conditions, and that brilliant first lap, in which he passed four cars to take the lead\n\u2022 None Michael Schumacher in a league of his own in Spain in 1996\n\u2022 None Lewis Hamilton winning by more than a minute at Silverstone in 2008 You can add a few more, too, including Jenson Button's dramatic last-to-first win in Canada in 2011, and Gilles Villeneuve's annihilation of the field at Watkins Glen in 1979, for example. All these races share characteristics - challenging conditions, often awful visibility, one driver apparently on a separate level from the rest of the field. Those all apply to Verstappen in Brazil on Sunday. His first lap was stunning - rising from 17th on the grid (although 15th car, as a result of Alex Albon and Lance Stroll not starting) to 11th. Then he was up to sixth by lap 11. OK, Verstappen did not scythe through the group involving Yuki Tsunoda\u2019s RB, Esteban Ocon\u2019s Alpine and Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc as quickly as he might have been expected to do. Yes, the win turned on a gamble on a red flag, which took George Russell and Lando Norris out of the picture - much to the annoyance of Russell, who disagreed with Mercedes\u2019 decision to pit him for fresh tyres under the virtual safety car. And in clear air, Verstappen did not have the huge advantage that Schumacher and Hamilton showed in Barcelona and Silverstone, where both were as much as five seconds a lap faster than anyone else. But his overtaking moves were clean and clinical, and the one to take the lead from Esteban Ocon\u2019s Alpine was a beauty - sending it on the brakes from at least two car lengths back. Once into the lead, Verstappen was a lot faster than anyone else. It was different class. And his win had something none of these other classics had - winning from so far back. That in itself is worthy of particular note. So, yes, there are plenty of reasons to rank it right up there with the very best, and the same goes for Verstappen himself. It\u2019s far from the first time he has excelled in the wet - he always has. Think of his brilliant comeback to third in Brazil in 2016, for example.\n\u2022 None Which was the greatest F1 wet-weather drive?\n\nMax Verstappen's drive in the wet was superb, but Lewis Hamilton is renowned for his wet driving. Why was he not competitive when George Russell was? \u2013 Howard Hamilton had a very difficult weekend in Brazil, and it follows closely on from another equally difficult one in Austin two weeks before. Any driver, no matter how great, needs to feel confidence in their car to perform at their best, and the Mercedes is simply not giving Hamilton the messages he needs. In Brazil, he could not build any confidence in the rear of the car. This is what he said after the race on Sunday: \"The race was crap but the driving Senna\u2019s car (a demo run in the 1990 McLaren-Honda MP4-6) was the best thing ever. I\u2019m still happy and grateful I had that experience here in Interlagos. \"An amazing reception from the fans. They turned up at 3am, I think, this morning. Let\u2019s not talk about the car because the car is no good. \"It\u2019s devastating to have these bad races in the second half of the season, but we are trying coming into the weekends, and it\u2019s definitely not acceptable and not good enough. \"We and I have to take accountability. I am doing my best with what I\u2019ve got. The car has been the worst this weekend. We will have to find out what it is. One of the cars is working a lot better, so there is obviously potential there.\" How will he get through the remaining three races, he was asked? \"Put my focus on to something else,\" he replied. \"I don\u2019t care if I finish ahead or behind George. I just want to keep the car out of the wall and try to score points for the team. Give me a car that doesn\u2019t bounce off the track and hopefully we can get a better result.\" He added that the end of the season \"can\u2019t come soon enough\". There seem to be a combination of issues here. In general, Hamilton has been struggling to get the best out of the ground-effect cars in qualifying since the current rules were introduced in 2022. This is because the cars don\u2019t respond to being hustled aggressively, something a number of drivers have mentioned. It remains an open question, though, as to why Hamilton - previously known for his adaptability - has not been able to adapt to the driving style required. And why he is sometimes struggling compared with Russell. Brazil was an exception, but generally his race performances have been as strong as ever. He has taken two wins this year, and until Sunday was ahead of Russell in the championship, despite being well down on his team-mate in qualifying, both in their head-to-head and in average pace. Clearly, something is not working between Hamilton and this Mercedes car, especially over one lap.\n\nDriving Ayrton Senna's 1990 McLaren-Honda was the highlight of Lewis Hamilton's weekend in Interlagos\n\nShould there be a change to the rules allowing tyres changes in red-flag conditions to remove the free pit stop advantage? \u2013 Nicola This topic comes up from time to time in circumstances such as those in Brazil on Sunday. This rule quirk potentially decided the race, and certainly disadvantaged Lando Norris and George Russell to the benefit of Max Verstappen and the Alpine drivers, who eventually finished on the podium. The other race that always springs to mind is Monaco in 2011, when the final stages were building into a gripping climax between Sebastian Vettel\u2019s Red Bull, Fernando Alonso\u2019s Ferrari and Jenson Button\u2019s McLaren. Vettel was on tyres that may or may not have made it to the end of the race - Alonso\u2019s considerably fresher, and Button\u2019s fresher still. Could Vettel hold them off? The question became redundant when there was a multi-car crash at the Swimming Pool and the race was red-flagged. Another example is Pierre Gasly\u2019s win for Alpha Tauri at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, when a pit stop just before a red flag led to the Frenchman being promoted to third, behind Lewis Hamilton, who had a penalty, and Lance Stroll, who still needed to stop. And that became a win. After that Monaco race, I remember asking the late FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting why that rule was in place. He agreed it wasn\u2019t very fair and should be looked at. But nothing happened when he was alive, and it still hasn\u2019t since he died on the eve of the 2019 season. It does seem anomalous, and it can be argued it is unfair. It can also be argued that in circumstances such as Brazil on Sunday it leads to teams and drivers taking unnecessary risks. Red Bull and Alpine decided to leave Verstappen, Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly out on worn intermediate tyres exactly because they expected there to be a big crash and a red flag - and George Russell wanted to do the same. This is despite Verstappen admitting it was \u201csketchy\u201d and Russell saying the conditions were \u201cundriveable\u201d. On the other side, it can be argued that the rules are what they are, and it adds the potential for upsets, and extra interest. Lando Norris said: \"It\u2019s a silly rule that no one agrees with but you will always agree when it benefits you. Every driver has said that they don't agree with it and wanted it changed, but it's a rule, you win some, you lose some. It has benefited them, so well done to them.\" Perhaps now it will be changed. But I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nThe safety car was deployed because it was 'too wet' to race, but most drivers were still on intermediate tyres. What is the point of the full wets? \u2013 Martin It\u2019s a question many drivers also ask. And even Pirelli admits that its full wet tyre - known as the \u2018extreme\u2019 - needs to be improved. Sebastian Vettel used to call it the \"safety-car tyre\". That\u2019s because it was effectively only used when races were controlled under caution, and its use was mandated. The issue is that while the extreme wet clears more water than the intermediate, it lacks grip. So the drivers want to get on to the intermediate as soon as possible because it's faster unless the conditions are really torrential - conditions in which F1 cars generally don\u2019t run because of the danger of such restricted visibility. The 'inter' has good grip, and a wide working window, effective in conditions that are very wet right down to almost dry. This situation will continue until Pirelli can improve the full wet tyre. Boss Mario Isola says they need more testing to do that.\n\nWhat can and can't you change during parc ferme and does this change during the wet or after crashes? \u2013 Joe \u2018Parc ferme\u2019 is a rule that effectively specifies a time beyond which the set-up and specification of the car are fixed. The idea behind it is to reduce costs. On any grand prix weekend, cars are in parc ferme from the start of qualifying to the end of the race. On a sprint weekend, there is a second closed window, from the start of sprint qualifying to the end of the sprint, after which the set-up can be changed before qualifying. The details of parc ferme can be found in article 40 of the sporting regulations on the FIA website, external. But in simple terms, teams can change only the angle of the front wing once the car is in parc ferme, in addition to repairing any damage, as long as the FIA approves it. If the FIA declares a change of climatic conditions, further changes can be made to make the car more suitable for wet weather.",

    "Sir Chris Hoy performed the baton ceremony before the men's cycling sprint finals at this year's Paris Olympics\n\nCyclist Sir Chris Hoy says he has been \"blown away\" by a near eight-fold increase in NHS searches for prostate cancer symptoms since he revealed his terminal diagnosis. The six-time Olympic champion, 48, said at the weekend that doctors have told him he has between two and four years to live. In the 48 hours after he had confirmed the news, NHS England said there were 14,478 visits to their symptoms advice website, compared to 1,876 in the previous week - a rise of 672%. It added the numbers peaked on Sunday with 8,816 visits. In a video posted on social media, external on Thursday, Sir Chris said he had received \"incredible kindness and support\". \"I now have a deep resolve to turn this incredibly difficult diagnosis into something more positive,\" he added. \"I understand that there has been a massive increase in men seeking advice in prostate cancer in the last few days and that's been a huge comfort to us to know that hopefully many lives could be saved by early testing.\" Sir Chris also said that he has written a book titled All That Matters, which will be released in November, about his illness and the story of his life since retiring from professional cycling in 2013. He described the writing experience as cathartic for himself and his family, and said that he hopes the book can provide understanding around how families deal with a terminal diagnosis and to \"remind us that all we have is now\". NHS England's National Clinical Director for Cancer, Professor Peter Johnson said: \"We're very sorry to hear about Chris' prognosis, but his decision to speak so openly about it could save lives by encouraging people to come forward sooner with their symptoms. \"Thanks to his bravery, we have seen a significant spike in people accessing vital information on our website about the signs and symptoms of cancer.\"\n\nSir Chris and Sarra Hoy married in 2010 and share two children\n\nSir Chris won six Olympic golds between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian behind Sir Jason Kenny's tally of seven.

    "Four soldiers have been killed and 58 injured in a drone strike targeting an army base in northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said. The IDF added seven soldiers had been severely injured in the attack on a base \"adjacent to Binyamina\" - a town around 20 miles (33km) to the south of Haifa. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said targeted a training camp of the IDF's Golani Brigade in the area, which is based between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The armed group's media office said the strike was in response to Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon and Beirut on Thursday.\n\nThe group said it targeted the camp in northern Israel using a \"swarm of drones\". The attack was one of the biggest on an Israeli position in more than a year. The Israeli ambulance service, Magen David Adom (MDA), earlier said 61 people had been injured in the attack - including three critically. It added 37 of them had been taken to eight regional hospitals, either by ambulance or helicopter. In a statement before the IDF confirmed the deaths, MDA said that alongside the three critically injured, 18 of the victims were in a moderate condition, 31 sustained mild injuries and nine people were \"suffering anxiety\". The reason for the discrepancy in the number of critical injuries between MDA and the IDF is not clear. Israeli censorship rules had initially prevented media outlets reporting exactly where or what was targeted, before the IDF confirmed it was the Binyamina base. Some Israeli media outlets have reported the base was hit by a low-level drone launched from Lebanon - a relatively unsophisticated weapon that appears not to have activated early-warning alarms. Throughout the evening, television bulletins, social media posts and online reports showed footage of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, taking casualties to hospitals across northern Israel. Many of the wounded have been evacuated to Hillel Yaffe Medical Centre in nearby Hadera - with others being taken to hospitals in Tel Hashomer, Haifa, Afula and Netanya. Details are still scarce but many of the injured appear to have been in a communal canteen at the time and were caught completely by surprise. Images circulating on social media appear to show an empty mess hall with a hole in the roof.",
    "Carer murdered woman, 90, after stealing from her\n\nA carer who hit a \"defenceless and vulnerable\" 90-year-old woman in her own home with a metal flask before smothering her with a pillow has been jailed for murder. The 52-year-old also admitted stealing \u00a360 from Mrs Thompson as well as taking jewellery from other clients. At Liverpool Crown Court, Hill was sentenced to a minimum prison term of 22-and-a-half years.\n\nThe court heard Hill had been sacked by her care agency after she was filmed on a covert camera stealing money from Mrs Thompson. Hill, who has two daughters and four granddaughters, did not tell her partner about losing her job and pretended to still go to work. When questioned by detectives following Mrs Thompson's death, Hill initially denied any involvement. But in a third police interview, she said she had gone to Mrs Thompson's home in Bolde Way, Spital, late one night to apologise and return the money. Hill, who claimed this was all part of an attempt to save her job, said she chose to visit Mrs Thompson late at night so as to avoid being seen by neighbours. She told police that Mrs Thompson had started shouting at her when she let herself in with a key from a keysafe. This was when Hill said she hit her victim with a flask and then, when the 90-year-old continued to shout, smothered her.\n\nMrs Thompson was only 5ft 3in (160cm) tall and weighed less than 7st (45kg). The court also heard she had Parkinson\u2019s disease and leg ulcers, and used a Zimmer frame. Other carers found her to be \"very independent\" and \"very alert\". Prosecutor Nick Johnson KC said: \"This was a planned attack on a defenceless vulnerable woman in her own home which was motivated by either money, revenge or a desire to remove the witness to Jayne Hill\u2019s dishonesty - or a mixture of all three.\" He said Mrs Thompson's body was found at her house by another carer. The court heard that phone data proved Hill, from Wirral, had also gone to her victim's house three days before the murder. Hill's lawyer David Polglase said his client could not properly explain her reaction to being caught stealing. \"She has expressed sorrow and remorse for what she\u2019s done,\" said Mr Polglase. He said Hill, of Norwich Drive in Upton, had no previous convictions but \"fell to temptation\" after financial pressures at home. She was given 20 months for theft and for stealing jewellery from other clients. These sentences will run concurrently with her murder sentence. Judge Andrew Menary KC said: \"The suddenness, ferocity and persistence of the violence you used demonstrates, I am sure, that you went there that night intending to kill your victim. \"You wanted to try to conceal the fact that a crime had been committed by removing the person who you believed was the only possible witness.\"\n\nMyra Thompson cared for her disabled husband for 50 years\n\nAnn Jarvis said her friend and neighbour Mrs Thompson had worked in a caring role all her life at Clatterbridge cancer unit, as well as looking after her disabled husband for 50 years. \"All Myra wanted and deserved was to spend the rest of her days in the comfort of her own home and be treated with the respect and dignity she has shown to others,\" said Mrs Jarvis. The victim's niece, Anne Charters, said: \"We can only imagine the terror she experienced during her final moments on the evening of 23 April in her own home, a place where she was supposed to be safe.\" Det Insp Dave Jones of Merseyside Police described Hill's attack as \"the ultimate breach of trust\". \u201cHill admitted being responsible for Myra\u2019s death and has rightly been sentenced for her monstrous actions,\" he said.\n\u2022 None Carer admits killing woman, 90, in her own home",
    "'Why is my endometriosis treatment not urgent?'\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLara Stevens says endometriosis is like the cancer she had as a child, with the potential to spread and damage multiple organs \u2013 but feels it is not treated with the required urgency. \"The endometriosis could be growing and I wouldn\u2019t know where it is and what it's going to do next,\" said the 36-year-old, who had non-Hodgkin lymphoma aged seven. Gynaecology waiting lists in Wales have increased by 92% in the past four years, yet specialists feel it is seen as less urgent than other surgeries. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is calling for long-term investment in women's health, and the Welsh government said it is a key priority and a women's health plan is due this year.\n\nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines. In rare cases it has even been found in the lungs, eyes, spine and brain. It was once thought that the only place in the body where endometriosis did not occur was the spleen, but in 2020 it was found there also. Symptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods, and the condition is also associated with infertility.\n\n\"I hate to think if I had waited, what could have happened,\" says Lara Stevens\n\nLara said she had been trying to become pregnant for four years, but after a number of miscarriages and additional waits for fertility support, she opted to use her health insurance to have surgery privately. \"I was saddened that it wasn't being seen as a priority, because when I did have my surgery I was riddled with it (endometriosis),\" she said. \"It was all around the back of my bladder, my bowel, it was sitting under both my ovaries, and I hate to think if I had waited, what could have happened.\" The university lecturer, who lives near Cardiff, said she was led to believe at the time there were four or five year waits for surgery. \"I was in my early 30s at that point and didn\u2019t want to be in my late 30s still trying, but also thinking about the damage the endometriosis was doing to my organs. \"No woman knows when their periods are going to end, so you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place.\"\n\nLara fell pregnant soon after surgery to remove endometriosis, and has recently had a second baby. But she said a lesion remains on her bowel and she is likely to need further surgery. She is now under the care of NHS gynaecology services, where waits for routine follow-up appointments can also be lengthy. There are currently more than 50,000 women in Wales waiting for hospital gynaecological services, with nearly half waiting longer than the target of 26 weeks, and more than a third waiting longer than 36 weeks. \"I understand personally why cancer is important,\" she said. \"What I'm saying is maybe this should be seen as just as important, because it's a condition that can be unpredictable, could get worse, and needs to be monitored. \"To be constantly feeling like you\u2019re fighting to get that help, makes it harder.\"\n\nRecent NHS performance figures show four other specialties with waiting lists longer than gynaecology. However, when you take into consideration only those who are eligible for gynaecology, per head of population gynae services are on a par with the worst waits in Wales, and worse than England or Scotland. Geeta Kumar, vice-president for clinical quality at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology, as well as clinical lead for women's services in north Wales, said there were multiple reasons for growing waiting lists. \"Women\u2019s awareness of conditions has increased \u2013 which is for the good, but we also feel that women's health has been de-prioritised for a long period,\" she said.\n\nGeeta Kumar says during Covid one of the most rapidly cancelled lists for treatment was gynaecology\n\nShe said there has been a concerted effort to move away from describing conditions like pelvic pain, prolapse and endometriosis as \"benign gynaecological conditions\" and instead use the term \"non-cancerous\". \"Benign gives the perception that it is not urgent, so when it comes to elective planned lists, compared to other surgical specialties, gynaecology often got de-prioritised,\" she added. The phrase is also viewed by many patients as minimising or trivialising symptoms which Dr Kumar described as \u201cextremely debilitating\u201d. \"Women are reporting not just physical harm, but also their mental wellbeing being affected, even some are not able to leave home because of the condition, whether it's pain or bleeding they\u2019re suffering from.\"\n\nDelyth Jewell MS says many women feel pain is normalised and it takes longer for symptoms to be taken seriously\n\nPlaid Cymru Member of the Senedd (MS) Delyth Jewell, who sits on the cross-party group on women's health in the Senedd, said the delays to see a specialist were compounded when many women felt they have had their symptoms dismissed and battled to be referred. \"Women are too often not believed or told that they have to put up with pain,\" she said. \"They go years with chronic pain - being gaslit, being told that maybe they just are suffering with anxiety, or it\u2019s all in their head.\" In July 2022 the Welsh government published a quality statement on women's health, acknowledging \"significant disparities in care between men and women\".

    "Inquiry into poisoning of Dawn Sturgess to start\n\nDawn Sturgess, 44, did not know the perfume she was spraying herself with was a lethal nerve agent\n\nA public inquiry is to begin later in Salisbury, to examine how a woman from Wiltshire was killed by a 2018 poisoning blamed on Russian agents. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after coming into contact with Novichok - the same chemical weapon used to target a former Russian spy four months earlier. The nerve agent had been hidden inside a designer perfume bottle. The inquiry will examine the circumstances leading to her death, try to establish where responsibility lies and highlight any lessons.\n\nThe first week of evidence will be heard at the Guildhall in Salisbury. Monday\u2019s session will begin at 11:00 BST with a day of opening statements. On Tuesday, the inquiry will hear about Ms Sturgess from her mother, Caroline Sturgess. The rest of the week will focus on evidence and experiences from the local first responders, including paramedics and Wiltshire Police. After a week\u2019s break, the inquiry will move to central London where it will hear details relating to the targeting of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the former Russian spy and his daughter, who had been poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury in March 2018.\n\nIt will also hear about Operation Verbasco, the police investigation into the Novichok incident. Due to national security, the public feed of the hearings will be on a short delay \u2013 and some evidence will be heard in private. The UK authorities blame the Russian state for the use of the chemical weapon, believing Russian agents were behind the original incident and then discarded the perfume bottle. It was later found by Ms Sturgess\u2019s partner Charlie Rowley \u2013 both thought it was designer perfume. Mr Rowley was taken ill at the same time as Ms Sturgess, but he later recovered. Russia has consistently denied any involvement and the Russian embassy has described the public inquiry as a \u201ccircus\u201d. Public hearings are due to conclude in the first week of December, before a final report is published in 2025.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

    "Son of Norwegian princess arrested on suspicion of rape\n\nMarius Borg H\u00f8iby is in a detention centre in Oslo, Norwegian police said\n\nThe son of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit has been arrested on suspicion of rape. Marius Borg H\u00f8iby, 27, is the stepson of the heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon, but does not a have a royal title or official duties. On Tuesday, Norwegian police said Mr H\u00f8iby had been charged with sexual intercourse with \"someone who is unconscious or for other reasons is unable to resist the act\". Mr H\u00f8iby, who has reportedly denied the rape allegation, is facing a number of charges for offences allegedly committed against four other victims.\n\nIn a statement, police said the rape \"concerns [a] sexual act without intercourse\" and that the victim was \"said to have been unable to resist the act\". According to local reports, the Norwegian palace has declined to comment on the latest arrest of Mr H\u00f8iby. Mr H\u00f8iby was arrested by police at 23:12 (22:12 GMT) on Monday in a car with a victim from a separate incident. In relation to this separate incident, on 4 August, he faces charges of violence and criminal damage. Police said, external on Tuesday that the charges had been expanded to include \"maltreatment\" in close relationships and \"another violation\" of a restraining order against the same victim. They added that a report had been made for driving without a valid driver's licence. Mr H\u00f8iby's residence at Skaugum, close to where the crown prince and his wife live, has also been searched by police.

Southampton 'are one of the best in the Premier League' - Pep Guardiola\n\nSouthampton were beaten at Manchester City, as most people expected. They are bottom of the Premier League, with a single point from their first nine games of the season. Manager Russell Martin is under pressure, despite guiding Saints back to the top flight only five months ago. Speaking to the media after Saturday's 1-0 result, both managers heaped praise on the beaten team. It was not so much that they were unlucky to lose. If Erling Haaland had a better day, he would have scored more than just the fifth-minute match-winner. Manchester City beat Southampton in an open game - not just because they found a way through a blanket defence. Towards the end of the first half, the visitors had the majority of possession. It was down to 42.3% by the end. As a guide, City\u2019s previous two opponents, Sparta Prague and Wolves, have had 20.1% and 22.4% respectively. If Southampton are to go down, or Martin is to lose his job, it will be by committing to a gameplan he believes in. \"I took the job [at MK Dons] nearly five years ago, with the club in the League One relegation zone and the chairman saying he didn't care if they got relegated if he could see something he believed in and could be proud of,\" said Martin. \"There have been some moments of real difficulty at MK and Swansea and here, where you get questioned and have to make a big decision. \"But if I end up losing my job at some point, which is inevitable, at least I can say I have stuck to what I want to be, as a person first, then a leader and then as a manager. \"To get to the Premier League and then change would be illogical. I cannot stand on the sidelines watching something I don't feel connected with or love. I don't see the point in that.\" That requires Southampton's players to have courage to take the ball in tight areas, carry on passing when the pressure is at its greatest and not allow poor results or adversity to change that mindset.\n\nSouthampton manager Russell Martin was praised by counterpart Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's 1-0 win at Etihad Stadium\n\nThe circumstances are significantly different - given the size of the club he was going into, and the knowledge he could call on generational talents in Xavi and Andres Iniesta, and the man he regards as the greatest ever in Lionel Messi - but Pep Guardiola needed to do something similar when he was given the Barcelona job, aged 37 - a year younger than Martin is now. Now revered as one of the greatest managers in history, Guardiola appreciates what Martin is doing and even feels there are aspects of Southampton's play he can learn from. \"We were not sloppy, we were not flat, but we struggled to regain the ball because they are really good,\" said the City boss. \"I'm a spectator. I prefer the players to get the ball to feet, not the teeth. \"When I see the opponent do the things I like to do with my team and they do it really well, I make a compliment. \"I'm sure I will learn, there were some movements, the reasons why they do things, the movements they make to link to the striker. It's not easy.\u201d He added on Sky Sports: \"It's a good game to learn as a manager. I am going to learn a lot with Russell because they did really well.\" Guardiola did not just praise Martin to the media, he also spoke to the Saints boss straight after the final whistle - and Martin revealed City and England playmaker Phil Foden had also done so. \"They felt we were really brave with the ball and did stuff not many teams do,\" said Martin. \"It is not easy to play that way but he probably understands it more than anyone. \"I have seen so many teams promoted and get nowhere. If we lose I can accept it when the lads show a level of courage like they did today. If they do that here they can do it anywhere. \"I will live and die by the sword for what I believe in. If we keep playing like we did today we will have some fun and be all right.\" Fun might be an extreme way of describing Southampton's current predicament. Pressure can scramble the mind and - after throwing away a victory against Ipswich in injury time and losing a two-goal lead in the final half-hour against Leicester - the forthcoming games against Everton and Wolves look huge for Martin and his side's survival hopes. If the former Scotland international can really have fun in games like that, he deserves all the success that comes his way.",
    "Melania Trump is latest Republican First Lady to back abortion\n\nMelania Trump seems to have joined a long line of Republican former first ladies who have come out in support of abortion rights, putting them at odds with their husbands' public views. In a short video clip promoting her forthcoming book, Mrs Trump expressed her support for women's \"individual freedom\", describing it as an \"essential right that all women possess from birth\". It comes a day after an excerpt of her soon-to-be-released memoir, in which she reportedly takes an even clearer pro-choice stance, was published in a newspaper report. Mrs Trump's apparent stance on the issue appears to contrast with the position of her husband, who has taken credit for helping overturn Roe v Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBut it follows a decades-long American tradition of Republican first ladies who - since Roe v Wade was first decided in 1973 - have said legal abortion access should be protected. In 1975, while still in the White House, First Lady Betty Ford called the Roe ruling a \"great, great decision\". Nancy Reagan waited until her husband, President Ronald Reagan, left office before she said publicly that she \"believed in a woman's choice\", but her position on the issue was reportedly well known within the White House. Barbara Bush, wife of President George HW Bush, and her daughter-in-law, Laura Bush, wife of President George W Bush, were similar, revealing their stance on the issue after their husbands left the White House. \"I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons,\" Laura Bush said in a 2010 interview promoting her memoir. In a black-and-white video posted on her X account on Thursday, Mrs Trump said \"there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom\". \"What does my body, my choice really mean?\" Mrs Trump continued. The video comes one day after The Guardian, external published an excerpt from her new book, Melania, set to be released on 8 October. In the excerpt, quoted by the Guardian, she writes: \u201cIt is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.\" \u201cWhy should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman\u2019s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,\" she continues. \u201cRestricting a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. \"I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\u201d Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of the book First Women, said she was \"shocked\" by the comments. \"So shocked that I wanted to check it was real,\" she said. \"She's very much been in line with her husband, so on this issue how did she spend all those years watching him derail something that she seems to care about?\" More than the other first ladies, Ms Brower said, Mrs Trump's comments appear \"diametrically opposed\" to her husband's approach on the issue. And she is the only first lady so far to make her stance on abortion known while her husband is actively seeking re-election. Indeed, the timing of Mrs Trump's comments suggest a possible political angle, Ms Brower said. \"It's not out of the realm of possibility that this was done intentionally to come out right before the election, because it could appeal to those swing state voters who are upset about the overturning of Roe v Wade,\" she said. \"Maybe they could see this as a sign that he [Trump] perhaps is softening on abortion.\" The notion of Mrs Trump trying to help out her husband \"doesn\u2019t track with the Melania we know\", she said. \"At this point in the game it doesn\u2019t change anything, and she knows that,\" Ms Shah said. \"Early ballots have already gone out in certain places. It\u2019s just too late.\" Abortion access is a key issue in next month's 2024 election - and it is considered a weak point for the Republican Party, which has struggled to appeal to a conservative base that opposes the procedure and a wider electorate that supports abortion access, external. Throughout the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump's position on the issue has fluctuated. Earlier this week, the Republican presidential nominee said for the first time that he would veto any federal abortion ban in the unlikely event that such a measure ever passed Congress. The BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has sought to capitalise on Trump's position in an effort to galvanise voters. She has regularly cast Trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of the overturning of Roe v Wade, which took place after he appointed a conservative majority to the Supreme Court. \u201cSadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump\u2019s husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,\" Sarafina Chitika, a spokeswoman for the Harris-Walz campaign told the BBC.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Steve Borthwick took over as England coach two years ago after a miserable autumn campaign in 2022 prompted Eddie Jones' departure\n\nCoverage: Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe soft centre of a southern hemisphere sandwich. That is how Saturday\u2019s encounter with Australia appeared when England revealed their 2024 autumn fixtures. Between ever-competitive New Zealand and world champions South Africa, England play an Australia team they have beaten in 10 of their previous 11 meetings - a run that began after England's pool-stage defeat in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. More recent form doesn't challenge the perception either. Australia have lost five of their last six matches. They finished bottom of the Rugby Championship. Last year's Rugby World Cup campaign ended in a miserable pool-stage exit. They are ranked ninth in the world, below Italy and a smidge above Fiji. The current crop of Wallabies are certainly short of bounce. They can, however, still box. Canny coaches, blockbuster talent and a cherished underdog status give the tourists a puncher's chance at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham on Saturday. And, given their wobbly form, England are certainly not invulnerable to an upset. Steve Borthwick's side themselves have only one win - a comfortable cruise past Japan - from their last five fixtures. Several times in that run, they have been locked on for the winners' enclosure, only to veer into the rails in the final quarter. Their ability to fade faster than a boil wash is stark. Among the top 10 teams in the world this year, none have scored more points than the 77 England have chalked up between 40 minutes and 60 minutes in matches. But, contrastingly, none have scored fewer than the 35 they have managed from the hour mark to full-time. England have a points difference of 47 from 40-60 minutes in matches this year. They are minus 23 from the final quarter. The way that an eight-point lead evaporated late on against All Blacks last weekend swung the spotlight onto England\u2019s bench. Replacement fly-half George Ford missed two potentially match-winning shots. Scrum-half Harry Randall struggled to connect with his team-mates. The rejigged forwards went into retreat.\n\nRandall and Ford came on just after an hour played against New Zealand, with their side 22-14 up\n\nBorthwick has made changes in the hope his finishers can match up to the job description. All-brawn Luke Cowan-Dickie comes into the squad in place of all-court Theo Dan. The six-two split on the bench between forwards and backs has been abandoned in favour of a more conventional five-three split, meaning the pack won't be shuffled as dramatically in the closing stages. The only change to the starting XV is a positional switch in midfield, with Ollie Lawrence swapping to outside centre and Henry Slade coming inside to 12. The theory is that it should enable Lawrence - restricted to two carries against New Zealand - to get the ball in more space. However, the revival of a dual playmaker shape that worked fitfully under Eddie Jones has potential weaknesses. Slade will have to lead the backline defence from a different perspective, clocking dangers both inside and outside. Just back from shoulder surgery, he is also placed in the high-traffic lane where Lawrence made 27 tackles against the All Blacks. Len Ikitau - Australia's hard-running inside centre - is sure to test Slade early. On the other side of the ball, England certainly need something to spark their attack. Against New Zealand, they were heavy on perspiration, but light on inspiration. England's solitary try came from a smart Marcus Smith intercept of a ponderous pass, but they rarely looked as if they could pick a way though the defence via their own wit. Among the world\u2019s top 10 nations, only Wales have been less efficient in turning entries into the 22 into points this year. England have some fine attacking talents. But, whether it is the system or individuals within it, potential has not been cashed in as points. If it had, their last four defeats - all by a converted score or less - could have been very different. England's repeated failure to get over the horizon and out of sight will give 5-1 outsiders Australia hope. The instant installation of Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii in the backline will add to it, even if the weight of expectation will surely sit heavy on the 21-year-old.\n\nSuaalii was part of the Samoa team that beat England in the Rugby League World Cup semi-final at London's Emirates Stadium\n\nAn age-grade phenomenon, Suaalii has been brought back to union from rugby league in a statement move aimed at galvanising a team and reinvigorating a sport. For all the dollar signs and headlines though, his first game of union since his school days will come at Test level, with unfamiliar team-mates alongside him and 80,000 fans in front of him. Head coach Joe Schmidt admitted picking Suaalii is a gamble, and that it was one that might not pay off immediately. \"If not now, when?\" said the New Zealander. \"I think it makes some sense for him to play. It's unlikely it'll go perfectly, but it will be a benchmark that he can build from.\" Angus Bell and 23-stone tighthead Taniela Tupou are formidable foundations and the props will relish the chance to get at England at the set-piece. The back row of captain Harry Wilson, Rob Valetini and Fraser McReight have been star performers. Twenty-year-old wing Max Jorgensen, who starts on the bench, was almost as highly hyped as Suaalii coming up through school. Perhaps most importantly, Schmidt, who sculpted Ireland's intricate patterns between 2013 and 2019, is in the stands. His steady hand is even more critical than Suaalii's stardust in Australia's revival. So far under him improvement has been incremental. Victory over England would be a dramatic break-out success. It would also send Steve Borthwick's men plunging in the opposite direction before the visit of the Springboks. For all Australia's points of promise, it is a game England should win. But, as the Twickenham regulars can attest, there have been plenty of those. And, once the final whistle had blown, markedly fewer victories.",
    "Donald Trump attends his criminal trial in New York\n\nNew York prosecutors have vowed to oppose President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s effort to overturn his criminal conviction, but they expressed a willingness to wait to sentence him until he completes his upcoming presidential term. Prosecutors urged the judge who is overseeing Trump's sentence after his guilty verdict to consider options other than dismissal, including holding off until the president-elect is scheduled to leave the White House in 2029. The Manhattan district attorney's office asked Justice Juan Merchan to set a new deadline of 9 December for both sides to consider the case and file new motions. Trump's sentencing is scheduled for 26 November, but it could be delayed further.\n\nIn May, Trump was convicted on 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from an attempt to cover up a potential sex scandal ahead of his first presidential victory in 2016. A few weeks later, however, the US Supreme Court held in a separate case that presidents enjoy a degree of immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts.\" Trump's lawyers want a judge to overturn his New York conviction on the grounds of presidential immunity, and because of his impending term in the White House. On Wednesday, attorney Todd Blanche called for the \"immediate dismissal of this case,\" and argued such an outcome was required by the US Constitution and the Presidential Transition Act. Mr Blanche asked for a deadline of 20 December to file a full brief with the court. Prosecutors believe the issues at the centre of their case do not have to do with official presidential duties. They stressed that the trial and conviction occurred before the US Supreme Court decided this summer that presidents had broad protection from criminal prosecution. They did acknowledge Justice Merchan's \"need to balance competition consititutional interests\", however. They asked the judge to consider \"non-dismissal options\" that could included \"deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of Defendant's upcoming presidential term\". \u201cThe DA is saying that the court should put off sentencing until after Trump leaves the White House,\" said New York attorney and former prosecutor Mitchell Epner. \"Don\u2019t drop the conviction - but don\u2019t do anything until after Trump leaves office.\" With Trump's inauguration just weeks away, little time remained on the calendar for a new round of motions and briefs, Mr Epner said. The case would be paused anyway after 20 January, when Trump takes the oath of office, he said. Of the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, the New York case was the only one to go to trial and reach a guilty verdict. But the final outcome is now uncertain as Trump prepares to head to the White House next January. Nevertheless, Trump's spokesman Steven Cheung - who has been tapped to serve as White House director of communications - declared \"total and definitive victory\". Justice Merchan has yet to rule on the matter, however. Former Manhattan prosecutor Diana Florence said that this request makes it doubtful that Trump would face sentencing at the scheduled hearing on 26 November, as the judge will probably accept the prosecutors' proposal. \"I think there's less than half a percent chance that he'd be sentenced next week,\" she said. The judge has a range of options for Trump's sentence, including fines, probation and a four-year prison sentence - though legal experts say the president-elect could avoid any legal punishment. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg first charged Trump with falsifying business records in April 2023, accusing the president-elect of a hush-money scheme in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors said that Trump tried to disguise reimbursements to his personal attorney, who had paid off an adult film star with whom Trump allegedly had an affair. Because of the scheme's proximity to the election, they claimed it amounted to election interference. Trump maintained his innocence, denied that the affair ever occurred and alleged the case was a form of political persecution. But in May, a jury of 12 New Yorkers found the president-elect guilty. Trump's sentencing hearing was delayed multiple times. The court agreed to hold off any decisions until today while all parties sorted out the historic implications of his re-election.",

Officials say tests found the balls to be formed from chemicals similar to those in cosmetics and cleaning products but it is still unclear where they came from.

'Youth guarantee' to focus on 'earning or learning'\n\nYoung people who refuse to work will face having their benefits cut, the work and pensions secretary has said. Liz Kendall told the BBC the government will offer young people the opportunity to \"earn or learn\" under new proposals to be unveiled on Tuesday. \"In return for those new opportunities young people will have a responsibility to take them up,\" she said. Official figures published earlier this week showed that nearly a million young people were out of education, employment or training between July and September.\n\nUnder new measures to reform the welfare system, a \"Youth Guarantee\" for 18 to 21-year-olds aims to train young people or get them back into work. Kendall told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg these proposals would see an overhaul of the apprenticeship system so \"more people have the chance to train\" with young people offered \"the opportunity to be earning or learning\". Asked if those who did not take up these offers would lose benefits, Kendall replied: \"Yes.\" She said this would transform opportunities for young people. \"If you are out of work when you\u2019re young that can have lifelong consequences in terms of your future job prospects and earning potential.\"\n\nIn an op-ed in the Mail on Sunday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised that the benefits overhaul would crack down on \"criminals\" who \"game the system\". Kendall told the BBC that she believed there were people who can work but refused to do so, but said she thought these people were \"in the minority\" of benefit claimants. Economic inactivity has grown rapidly since the pandemic. There are now 9.3 million people who are neither in work nor looking for a job - a rise of 713,000 since Covid. Nearly three million people are out of work due to ill health, a 500,000 increase since 2019. Asked about the rise in benefit claimants in recent years, Kendall said some people have \"self-diagnosed\" mental health problems, as well as those \"diagnosed by doctors\" - but added that there was a \"genuine problem\" with mental health in the UK.\n\nKevin Hollinrake said there were \"incentives in the system\" for people to leave work and claim benefits\n\nUnder the previous Conservative government's plans to tighten eligibility for incapacity benefits, an estimated 400,000 people signed off work long-term would have lost payments. The work and pensions secretary refused to confirm whether those people would keep their benefits under Labour's proposals. \"We will deliver those savings, we will bring forward our own reforms,\" she said.\n\nShadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said that rising numbers of people out of work due to ill health was \"a phenomenon caused largely by the pandemic\". He said the previous government had been \"dealing with it\" and welcomed Labour's focus on the issue, but added: \"I want to make sure they do the right things rather than just talk a good game.\"\n\nAre you a young person in work or receiving benefits?",
    "Max Verstappen is the fourth man to win four consecutive drivers' championships\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen won his fourth consecutive World Drivers\u2019 Championship with fifth place in the Las Vegas Grand Prix. The race was won by Mercedes' George Russell, who held off a charge by team-mate Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time champion taking second place from 10th on the grid. Verstappen\u2019s position behind the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc was more than enough for the Dutchman. His title rival Lando Norris could manage only sixth for McLaren, his deficit to the Dutchman now 63 points with a maximum of 60 available. Verstappen joins Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel as a four-time champion, with only Hamilton, Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio ahead of him in that list. \"What a season,\" Verstappen said to his team over the radio. \"It was a little more difficult than last season, but we pulled through.\" He added: \u201cIt has been a long season and we started amazing, almost like cruising, and then we had a tough run but we kept it together as a team, kept working on improvements and pulled it over the line. \"To stand here as a four-time world champion is something I never thought possible so standing here relieved in a way but also proud.\u201d\n\nVictory in Las Vegas is Mercedes' fourth grand prix win this season, with Russell and Hamilton taking two each\n\nThird and fourth places for the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc reduced their deficit to McLaren in the constructors\u2019 championship to 24 points with two races to go. Norris stopped for fresh tyres to take fastest lap in the closing stages to give McLaren an extra point. Verstappen, starting one place ahead of Norris in fifth place on the grid, headed his rival throughout a relatively quiet race for the Red Bull driver as Russell took control from the start. Verstappen's measured performance was aimed at securing the title at the first chance he had, and he did so with the calmness and aplomb with which he has driven for the vast majority of the year. Russell controlled the race from the front, fending off an early challenge from Leclerc, who jumped from fourth on the grid to second past Alpine's Pierre Gasly and then Sainz around the first two corners. And as Leclerc then squabbled with the recovering Sainz, and the Ferraris then ran into tyre trouble before Mercedes and Verstappen, Russell stretched out his lead to take control of the race. Hamilton ran 10th in the early laps, but drove a superb first stint, fast while also keeping his tyres in shape.\n\nHe vaulted up on to the back of the lead group by delaying his first stop, and passed Norris shortly after it. The seven-time champion then set about challenging the Ferraris, with Verstappen at this point second ahead of Sainz and Leclerc, having overtaken the red cars with a later pit stop. But Hamilton, lacking straight-line speed in his Mercedes, was unable to make progress past the red cars. Instead, Mercedes made a second pit stop on lap 27, a lap before Sainz and four laps before Leclerc, and Hamilton used his pace to emerge in second place. He caught Verstappen with a succession of fastest laps and swept by on the straight on lap 31. Russell followed Leclerc in on lap 32, and for a few laps after his stop Hamilton took chunks out of his team-mate\u2019s lead, getting it down from 11.2 seconds to 7.4 in seven laps. But it soon became clear that Russell had the race under control, and he led Hamilton to an unexpected one-two. Behind them, the Ferraris closed back in on Verstappen after their final pit stops and both passed him in the final 10 laps.

    "Europe's Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald said Sergio Garcia \"was very interested\" about rejoining the tour when the pair spoke recently\n\nLIV Golf's Sergio Garcia is set to rejoin the DP World Tour for the 2025 season as he seeks to play at next year's Ryder Cup. Garcia, 44, who is the event's record points scorer, wants to match Lee Westwood and Sir Nick Faldo's European record of 11 appearances at the biennial competition. However, in order for that to happen, the Spaniard has had to settle the outstanding substantial fines - reported to be more than \u00a31m - imposed on him by the tour for his previous defection to play LIV events, and he will also have to serve a suspension. A spokesman for the Europe-based DP World Tour confirmed former Masters winner Garcia submitted an application to return to the membership before the 17 November deadline. European players wishing to be selected for the Ryder Cup must be members of the tour. \"He has paid his fines but will have to serve his suspensions before he can play on the DP World Tour,\" the spokesman added. The 2025 Ryder Cup takes place at Bethpage in New York from 26-28 September. Europe's captain Luke Donald recently said he had been speaking to Garcia about the Spanish star returning to the tour and becoming eligible to play on the team. Garcia has won 16 titles on the European tour, as well as 11 PGA Tour titles, with his 2017 Masters title counting in both tallies. He joined the breakaway LIV Golf, a Saudi-funded series, in 2022 along with other big names from the sport. He resigned his membership of the European circuit in May 2023 after an arbitration panel found in favour of the DP World Tour and confirmed its right to fine and ban players who competed in LIV Golf events without permission.\n\nGarcia has made no secret of his desire to return to the European Ryder Cup team and clearly believes a fine of more than \u00a31m is worth paying to make himself available for next year's match at Bethpage. The all-time record points scorer missed Europe's triumph in Rome but has a long friendship with captain Luke Donald that stretches back to their successful playing partnership in previous matches. Clearly the attraction of playing under Donald in New York next year has proven irresistible to Garcia. He will need to play four events next season, after missing events for which he has been suspended, to maintain his renewed membership. Garcia remains suspended from the PGA Tour, as are all players still competing on the breakaway LIV circuit. But the Spaniard is not alone in paying DP World Tour fines with Adrian Meronk, Dean Burmester, Joaquin Niemann, Thomas Pieters, Patrick Reed and Lucas Herbert all reinstating their memberships. Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton remain members until their appeals against fines are heard. This is unlikely to happen before the Ryder Cup.",
    "The family shop saying goodbye after 64 years\n\nThe shop has always been a family affair - as this picture from the past showing Alan (far right) and son Lee (second from left) plus other family members illustrates\n\nAlan Hartley was never supposed to open a fruit and veg shop. A career in engineering was on the cards for the-then 19-year-old, but Alan's eyes and heart were set on running his own mobile store. He spoke to mum Janet and dad Albert and had a chat with the council about his options. In November 1960, while still a teenager, he took control of an empty unit at what would become known as the Gaunt Shopping Centre - it wasn't on wheels, but it was his. On Friday, 64 years later, Alan pulled down the shutter for the final time on local retail institution AE Hartley & Son. When we meet him, Alan, now 83, surveys the scene around the shop, including new buildings and the empty neighbouring stores in which the tills went quiet a long time ago. \"We'd be looking at a field now,\" he says, gazing across the concrete precinct. \"Not a big brick wall at the back of a chemist. The view was definitely better then.\"\n\nThe family swapped green and white pinnies for fleeces\n\nThree generations of the Hartley family, wearing the matching blue fleeces introduced by the business 15 years ago, are standing inside the shop. They are happily reminiscing about the memories that have been created over butter, potatoes, toothpaste and toilet cleaner during the years they have worked there. A steady stream of customers comes through the door to offer well wishes. Some leave cards. Many are emotional. \"We've had tears from several customers. I'm saving mine for a bit,\" says Janet, Alan's 89-year-old sister who has been at his side since the start. She left a job in insurance, deciding that working with family in the shop suited her better. \"We're a big family. That\u2019s our strength. When it's backs to the wall. We present a united front,\" she adds.\n\nAlan (right) opened the store aged just 19 alongside his older sister Janet (left)\n\nFor the first few years the shop, named after Alan\u2019s father Albert Edward Hartley, simply sold fruit and veg. Fresh produce was lined up and displayed in boxes outside the front of the store on a well-swept pavement in the Gleadless area, about three miles south east of Sheffield city centre. Potatoes would arrive in huge wooden crates and have to be lugged up from the cellar. Alan\u2019s eldest son Lee, now 51, remembers watching on a child as his father and grandfather struggled with the \"back-breaking work\" of moving huge quantities of potatoes around. \"In the early 60s people weren\u2019t eating rice and pasta so we sold tonnes and tonnes of spuds. \"After a couple of years Dad realised the heavy lifting would kill him so he invested in a conveyer belt,\" he says. The original 1960s conveyer belt is still in operation today. Lee proudly fires it up to demonstrate its deafening whirl. The family are now looking into transferring it to a local museum.\n\nThe store has moved with the times - but also kept its own traditions including the locally renowned eggs\n\nLooking out across the shop from a stool perched behind the counter, Janet reflects on the current dwindling stock, deliberately run down before closure. In the far corner is a tall glass-fronted fridge, it is half-empty and contains energy drinks. \"I remember when they wheeled that in. \"We didn't know where to put it. It seemed so big,\" she says. \"We used to sell old glass bottles of Tizer and Dandelion and Burdock. \"People used to have it with their Sunday dinner,\" she recollects with a smile. A chest freezer followed. It's currently stocked with frozen pizzas and sausages. \"People purchase food differently. They just don't shop local anymore,\" she explains.\n\nThe shop sits in the heart of the Gaunt Shopping Centre\n\nLee ended up taking over the day-to-day running in the 1990s and despite only being in charge for a mere 30 years or so, he is clear on what has kept the business alive while others around have floundered and fallen. \"Adapt or die,\" he tells me, standing near a shelf where birthday candles and soap jostle for the pre-eminent position. \"When the supermarkets became more and more popular, all the shops around us started closing; the newsagent and bakers. \"We realised that we had to diversify and start stocking those products for our customers.\" Now behind the counter where there used to be a vat of loose dirty potatoes sits a neat row of greeting cards, wrapping paper and helium balloons. Time and the march of purchasing progress has not swept all before it in the shop just yet, though. Eggs can still be bought individually from a huge pile behind the counter. Customers know to return their old egg boxes to be re-used.\n\nThe shop has changed stock to suit customer tastes - including now selling sharon fruit to Sue\n\nSue Denton, 63, has been coming to the store for 40 years. She's brought flowers for the family and is buying some sharon fruit \u2013 something the shop didn't stock when it opened for the first time. \"It's near on, they sell everything. It\u2019s like a family for me. \"I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do now,\" she says. Mick Pearson, 68 comes in every day. He jokes: \"I come in to be abused. I\u2019m going to starve when they close.\"\n\nThis was the scene in the year 2000 when the store celebrated 40 years of trading\n\nAccording to the youngest generation of the Hartley clan, Jamie, 19, and Amy,18, the \"legendary\" pick-n-mix sweet boxes have also stayed the same over the years since their grandfather first opened up. Amy, talking about a bag containing a mix of cheaper sweets, insists: \"It's the only place round here you can get a proper good mix up.\" The teenage pair tease each other about child labour and who started working at the shop first. \"Put it this way, there\u2019s a photo of me as a baby in the sweetie weighing scales,\" laughs Jamie.\n\nAmy and Jamie are the latest generation of the family to work in the store\n\nOver the years the shop's nostalgic vibe has also caught the attention of TV producers. The exterior was used for the 1980s-set ITV underwear drama Brief Encounter, while in 2022 the Disney TV series of Sheffield-based The Full Monty used the store as a newsagents. Getting ready for the shop to close for the last time, Lee, who is moving into catering and currently converting a horse box for a new coffee business, admitted it would be a very difficult day: \"I'm very sad. I grew up with these people that come in, sad times are coming.\" Alan\u2019s hands-off approach has allowed him to see more than his shop counter for the past few years. He and wife Pat have enjoyed cruises to as far afield as Australia and China - and hope to explore further in their proper retirement. \"I'm ready for a rest but I'll miss the customers so much. They're more like friends.\"",
    "United by loyalty, Trump's new team have competing agendas\n\nIf personnel really does amount to policy, then we\u2019ve learned a lot this week about how Donald Trump intends to govern in his second term. More than a dozen major appointments, some of which will require Senate approval, offer a clearer picture of the team entrusted to drive his agenda as he returns to the White House. On the outside they appear united by one thing - loyalty to the top man. But beneath the surface, there are competing agendas. Here are four factions that reveal both Trump\u2019s ambition and potential tricky tests ahead for his leadership.\n\nTheir agenda: This trio have been among the most vocal politicians actively opposing US policies, particularly under President Biden. Choosing Gaetz as his attorney general nominee is possibly Trump\u2019s most controversial pick. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. A graduate of William and Mary Law School, he led the removal of California congressman Kevin McCarthy as the sitting Speaker of the House in October 2023. He has come under investigation by a House ethics committee for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl, using illegal drugs and misusing campaign funds. He denies wrongdoing and no criminal charges have been filed.\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week Tulsi Gabbard, picked to be Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, is a military veteran who served with a medical unit in Iraq. She is a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who switched parties to support Trump. Gabbard has routinely opposed American foreign policy, blaming Nato for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 then casting doubt on US intelligence assessments blaming Assad for using chemical weapons. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee health, is a longtime lawyer and environmentalist. He also spread fringe theories \u2013 about vaccines and the effects of 5G phone signals.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A look at Trump's cabinet and key roles... in 74 seconds\n\nWhat this tells us: Like Trump, Gaetz, Gabbard and Kennedy are aggressive challengers of the status quo. All three frequently tip over into conspiracy. They may be among the most determined supporters of Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d. The president-elect has picked particular fights in each of the areas they would oversee - law enforcement, intelligence and health. But bomb-throwers can also make unruly subordinates. Kennedy wants stricter regulation across food and farming industries, which may collide with Trump\u2019s government-slashing agenda. Gaetz\u2019s views on some issues - he favours legalisation of marijuana - are outside the Republican mainstream. And Gabbard, a fierce critic of American power, will be working for a president who is not afraid to use it - for instance, against Iran.\n\u2022 None What RFK could do on vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nTheir agenda: The three hardliners tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s border and immigration policies have vowed to strengthen security and clamp down on undocumented immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. Domestically, they - and the wider incoming Trump administration - have called for a drastic uptick in deportations, beginning with those considered national security or public safety threats, and a return to workplace \u201cenforcement operations\u201d that were paused by the Biden administration.\n\nWhat it tells us: Aside from the economy, polls repeatedly suggested that immigration and the border with Mexico were primary concerns for many voters. The possibility of increased deportations and workplace raids, however, could put Trump on a collision course with Democratic-leaning states and jurisdictions that may decide to push back or not co-operate. Some Republican states - whose economies rely, in part, on immigrant labour - may also object.\n\nTheir agenda: Trump has named the world\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk, to lead a cost-cutting effort dubbed the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d. He will share the role with 39-year-old investor-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy, who became an ardent Trump backer after bowing out as a candidate in the Republican primary. The two men are among the loudest and flashiest tech bros, a group that swung towards Trump this year, seeking a champion to disavow \u201cwoke\u201d political correctness and embrace a libertarian vision of small government, low taxes and light regulation. Musk has floated a possible $2tn in spending cuts, vowing to send \u201cshockwaves\u201d through the government. Ramaswamy, who has backed eliminating the tax-collecting agency, the IRS, and the Department of Education, among others, wrote after the announcement: \u201cShut it down.\u201d\n\nWhat it tells us: The appointments are an acknowledgment of the help Trump got on the campaign trail from Ramaswamy and Musk, the latter of whom personally ploughed more than $100m into the campaign. But time will tell what power this faction goes on to have. Despite its name, the department is not an official agency. The commission will stand outside the government to advise on spending, which is partly controlled by Congress. Trump, who ran up budget deficits during his first term, has shown little commitment to cutting spending. He has promised to leave Social Security and Medicare - two of the biggest areas of government spending - untouched, which could make cost-cutting difficult. RFK Jr\u2019s pledge to increase regulation of food additives and ultra-processed foods could also clash with Musk and Ramaswamy\u2019s mandate to cut red tape.\n\nTheir agenda: These men will run Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. They are all hawks on China. Rubio, nominee for secretary of state, is among Beijing\u2019s harshest critics, having argued for travel bans on some Chinese officials and for the closure of Hong Kong\u2019s US trade offices. The three are likely to push through Trump\u2019s pledge for much higher tariffs on Chinese imports. They see Beijing as the top economic and security threat to the US. Waltz - picked for national security adviser - has said the US is in a \u201cCold War\u201d with the ruling communist party. Ratcliffe, Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director who served as an intelligence chief in his first term, has likened countering China\u2019s rise to the defeat of fascism or bringing down the Iron Curtain.\n\nWhat it tells us: While Trump often signals his own hawkish economic views on China, he has also vacillated - which could spark tensions with his top foreign policy team. In his first term, Trump triggered a trade war with Beijing (attempts to de-escalate this failed amid the pandemic) and relations slumped further when he labelled Covid the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d. But he also heaped praise on President Xi Jinping as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d leader ruling with an \u201ciron fist\u201d. This unpredictability could make managing America\u2019s most consequential strategic relationship even harder. Rubio might also clash with Gabbard, Trump\u2019s pick for director of intelligence, who previously criticised him on foreign policy, saying he \"represents the neocon, warmongering establishment\".",

This bill is an improvement - EFL chair\n\nEnglish Football League chairman Rick Parry says he hopes a \"seminal\" review of the game by a new independent regulator could help overcome years of deadlock with the Premier League over greater financial redistribution. Strengthened legislation to establish a body to oversee the elite men's club game was relaunched by the government last month, and begins its second reading in parliament on Wednesday. About 40 peers are scheduled to speak in the House of Lords before any potential amendments are debated. Parry says the Football Governance Bill is \"an improvement\" on a version introduced by the previous government, and which failed to become law before the General Election was called in May. In a wide-ranging interview, he also told BBC Sport:\n\u2022 None concerns that the regulator could impact the Premier League\u2019s competitiveness were \"nonsense\"\n\u2022 None he expects the regulator to provide \"consistency of regulation\" amid a \"willingness [by] clubs at the drop of a hat to challenge the whole system\", warning that the game \"will grind to a halt unless we find a solution for that\"\n\u2022 None the parachute payments to clubs relegated from the Premier League have got \"way too big\", and it was \"intellectually incoherent\" to exclude them from the regulator\u2019s scope in the original legislation\n\u2022 None he \"passionately believes\" that the coach of the national team should be English.\n\nThe landmark legislation will give the regulator powers to assess the impact of the Premier League's controversial 'parachute payments' to relegated clubs as part of a 'State of the Game' review every five years. Its findings could influence which proposed sharing model the regulator may then impose - the Premier League's or the EFL's - if it is asked to decide how much money the top flight should redistribute to the football pyramid. \"We\u2019ve been real enthusiasts about the review, a proper independent analysis of the game's finances,\" Parry told BBC Sport. \"We think it\u2019s a seminal piece of work. \"It\u2019s never been done before\u2026 that should form the basis for the solution for whatever the revenue-sharing formula is going to be. \"You\u2019d hope that both parties would come close to it, but there\u2019s no guarantee of that\u2026 as we\u2019ve seen we\u2019re not very good at coming to deals.\" When asked if he was confident the two leagues could agree without the regulator having to enact its 'backstop power' to decide on a settlement, Parry said: \"Not really. We\u2019d love to get a deal done, but [there\u2019s] no signs to suggest it's going to be straightforward or quick.\"\n\nThe EFL has been calling for the Premier League to share 25% of its media revenues, but talks collapsed in March. Parachute payments are among the reasons the two leagues have been unable to reach a new financial settlement worth an average \u00a3125m per year extra, despite years of negotiations and pressure from politicians. The EFL believes the payments - worth tens of millions of pounds to relegated clubs - distort competition and encourage reckless spending among Championship clubs. The Premier League insists the payments are essential to give club owners the confidence to invest. After they were excluded from the previous bill, Parry is \"pleased\" that the regulator can now consider them if deemed of risk to financial sustainability. \"We\u2019re not saying they should be abolished,\" said Parry. \"They should be properly considered alongside other distributions, so the fact they are is good. Because they\u2019re a proportion of the Premier League\u2019s TV revenues, they have exploded over the last 20 years. \"They\u2019ve just got way too big and it needs a rethink. It really is about how do we make sure relegated clubs are protected, but there\u2019s fair competition within the Championship. \"We\u2019re all about sustainability and to achieve that what we really need is the position where we have sporting jeopardy without financial catastrophe.\"\n\nParry, who was the Premier League's first chief executive from 1992 to 1997, said the game needs \"fairer distribution of revenues\". He added: \"If you go to the first year of the Premier League in 1992-93, the difference in turnover [with the] EFL was \u00a311m. It\u2019s now \u00a33.3bn. That\u2019s a chasm that\u2019s not bridgeable, so we do need a reset.\" Amendments can be made to the legislation as it passes through parliament, and Parry says his \"strong preference\" is for the regulator to have the power to dictate its own financial settlement, rather than having to choose one of the proposals put forward by the leagues. Last month the Premier League expressed concern at the regulator having \"unprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of [its] revenues\" and said it could have \"a negative impact on competitiveness, clubs' investment in world-class talent and the aspiration that drives our global appeal and growth\". It is talking to government with a view to persuading it to make changes to the framework of the legislation in order to avoid what it has called \"unintended consequences\". However, Parry said fears the Premier League\u2019s competitiveness could be affected were \"nonsense\". \"In 2018-19 it was paying \u00a31.6 billion more in wages than the other major European leagues. Ten years previously it was \u00a3567m more, so the gap had grown by a billion, which is frankly extraordinary.\"\n\nParry also expressed concern at \u201ca whole raft of competition law cases which are impacting on the way that we run the game\". He continued: \"Having been left more or less free to set their own rules for many years, now the competition law authorities\u2026 seem to be saying, 'we don't think that the people running football are doing a terribly good job of it'. \"To be looking over our shoulder all of the time with challenges from clubs if they don't like rules\u2026 the game will grind to a halt unless we find a solution for that.\" In September, Leicester City won an appeal against a possible points deduction for an alleged breach of financial rules, when an independent panel found the Premier League did not have the jurisdiction to punish the club as it had been relegated to the Championship when their accounting period ended. The ruling indicated the wording in the Premier League's regulations was not legally sound. Last month two aspects of the Premier League\u2019s associated party transaction rules - which regulate commercial deals involving clubs' owners - were deemed unlawful by a tribunal after being challenged by Manchester City, which has since threatened further legal action. \"It's certainly getting a lot more difficult,\" said Parry. \"I have no problem with us having to be more professional and to be at the top of our game because that's where we should be. But it's the willingness of clubs at the drop of a hat to challenge the whole system. \"You have to question how long you can function effectively while that mentality exists, and we have to find a solution to that. \"The way in which we ensure consistency of financial regulation across the two leagues isn't working. One thing a single independent regulator will bring is that consistency.\" The legislation will \"explicitly require clubs to provide effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices, and any proposals to relocate home grounds. It will no longer be required to consider government foreign and trade policy when approving club takeovers, and there will be \"a clear commitment\" to do more to improve equality, diversity and inclusion. Nineteen amendments have been proposed by the Fair Game campaign group of 34 lower league clubs, including the scrapping of parachute payments, excluding the possibility that the owner of a club could be a state or state-controlled entity, and making the state of the game review assess player welfare, along with an examination of multi-club ownership.\n\nParry also called on the Football Association to improve the pathway for the development of homegrown coaches after the appointment of German Thomas Tuchel as England manager. \"I passionately believe that the coach of the national team should be English,\" said Parry, who sits on the FA\u2019s board. \"I think it's incumbent on us now to make sure that we have long-term solutions that we have the right pool of coaches coming through. That young English coaches are not demotivated by the thought 'we're never going to get the top job'. \"So I think in parallel with Thomas doing his utmost to win us the next trophy, it\u2019s really, really important that the FA is putting proper plans in place to make sure that we do improve the pathway. We cannot wait for 18 months and then say 'now we'll pick up the baton'. Now is the time to be to be looking at that.\"",

    "Aslef members are set to strike on different days in November\n\nLondon Underground train drivers are set to strike next month in a dispute over pay, the Aslef union has announced. As well as Tube drivers, instructors, management grade staff and those in the engineering section are to take action. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) has also announced industrial action by its members next month. Aslef said train operators and management grade staff would strike on 7 and 12 November, and those in the engineering section for 24 hours from 18:00 GMT on 1 November. Transport for London (TfL) said the action by Aslef and the RMT was \"disappointing\" but it remained engaged with the unions.\n\nFinn Brennan, Aslef\u2019s full-time organiser on London Underground, said: \"We don\u2019t want to go on strike \u2013 we don\u2019t want to make travelling in and around the capital more difficult for passengers and we don\u2019t want to lose a day\u2019s pay \u2013 but we have been forced into this position because [London Underground] management won\u2019t sit down properly and negotiate with us.\" The union said its Tube train driver members \"overwhelmingly\" backed taking industrial action, with 98.8% voting in favour on a turnout of 68%. Aslef is seeking a pay agreement with London Underground, which has offered a 3.8% pay rise and a variable lump sum. Mr Brennan said the offer would leave members on a lower salary than drivers on other TfL services, such as the Elizabeth line and Overground. Different groups of staff will also not be working any overtime at various times in November.\n\nThe RMT also announced that its members, including signalling and station staff, would walk out on different days between 1 and 8 November after rejecting a \"wholly inadequate\" pay offer. The union said some progress was made in negotiations, but maintained that the current proposal left a large number of staff excluded from collective bargaining. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"London Underground's pay offer falls short of what our members deserve. It threatens to remove collective bargaining for a growing portion of staff, pushing them into pay bands that are decided solely by management. This undermines our members' rights and the core principles of fair negotiation. \"No trade union can accept any pay proposal where management decide which of our members gets a pay rise and those who do not.\" Strikes will start on 1 November by maintenance workers and continue with different union members including signalling and station staff from 6-8 November. The RMT said about 10,000 of its members were involved in the dispute, adding that it remained ready to engage in talks - but that a \"fair and fully consolidated\" pay offer must be put forward.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \"We have held several constructive discussions with our trade unions and, after considering their feedback, have made a revised offer with an average uplift of 4.6%, which rewards our staff for their hard work and benefits the lowest-paid staff the most.\" They said talks had been conducted in \"good faith\" and further meetings would take place next week. \"Our offer is fair for our people and affordable for London, and we urge our unions to continue working with us to support London and the wider economy,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nPay talks do tend to follow this pattern, BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards writes. Commuters will hope that during the upcoming talks the dispute is resolved. Otherwise on the days Aslef train drivers go out there will be little if no service on the Tube. On the days of the RMT strikes there could be a service but it would be limited and heavily disrupted.",

    "Israeli strikes kill at least 40 in east Lebanon - health ministry\n\nPeople search through rubble following a strike in the town of al-Ain in the Baalbek region on Wednesday\n\nAt least 40 people were killed in Israeli air strikes in eastern Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The Israeli military said the strikes, in the governorates of Baalbek and Bekaa, hit operatives and infrastructure of the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Lebanon's culture minister said one of the strikes seriously damaged an Ottoman-era building in the vicinity of the Roman ruins in the city of Baalbek, which is a Unesco World Heritage site. Strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Wednesday, after the Israeli military issued new evacuation warnings. The military said it struck Hezbollah command centres, weapons stores and other infrastructure.\n\nA later military warning covered four neighbourhoods in southern Beirut including an area near Lebanon's only commercial airport, which has continued to operate during the war between Israel and Hezbollah. Soon afterwards, pictures showed a large fireball and thick black smoke rising into the night sky above Beirut. Meanwhile, a rocket fired by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon killed an Israeli man near a kibbutz in northern Israel, paramedics said.\n\nA large fireball was seen near Beirut's airport following an overnight Israeli strike\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Lebanon's Civil Defence agency said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from a four-storey apartment building that was hit by an Israeli strike the previous evening. The building in Barja, a predominantly Sunni Muslim coastal town south of Beirut that is outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds, was reportedly housing displaced people. The Israeli military said it had struck \"terror infrastructure\u201d belonging to Hezbollah. A man who lived on one of the upper floors of the apartment building said his son and wife were injured by falling masonry. \"These rocks that you see here weigh 100kg, they fell on a 13kg kid,\" Moussa Zahran told Reuters news agency as he surveyed the damage. \u201cI removed [the rocks] and... handed my son to the civil defence through the window. I carried my wife and came downstairs and got out behind the building... I thank God, glory be to Him, for this miracle.\u201d An Irish Times correspondent cited a member of the civil defence at the scene as saying that those killed whose bodies were found complete included seven women and three children, external - a seven-month-old baby and two girls aged seven and 12. Neighbours also said the building was housing displaced people who had fled from other areas, she added. There was no evacuation warning ahead of the strike, according to Reuters. The Lebanese health ministry gave a preliminary death toll of 20 from the strike on Barja late on Tuesday but did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday.\n\nMoussa Zahran said his wife and son were injured by the air strike in Barja\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the ministry said 40 people had been killed and 53 others injured in a series of Israeli strikes in Bekaa and Baalbek governorates, which make up most of the eastern Bekaa Valley. They included 16 people killed in the village of Nasriyah and 11 in Baalbek city, it added. Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada also told the director-general of Unesco that one of the strikes had \"caused serious damage to the ancient Manshiya building\" in Baalbek city, which he said dated back to the Ottoman period and was located in the vicinity of the ruins of several Roman temples. \"The destruction of this exceptional monument next to a Unesco World Heritage site is an irremediable loss for Lebanon and for world heritage,\" he warned. An AFP news agency correspondent also reported that the famous 19th Century Palmyra Hotel near the Roman ruins was damaged by nearby strikes, which the health ministry said killed two people. On Thursday morning, the Israeli military put out a statement saying it had killed approximately 60 Hezbollah fighters in strikes on about 20 \"terror targets\" in the area of Baalbek and north of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) north of the border with Israel. Dozens of other strikes targeted a rocket launcher, weapons storage facilities and other infrastructure, it added.\n\nThe military also said it had killed the commander of Hezbollah\u2019s forces in the southern border region of Khiam, and that a number of other Hezbollah fighters had been killed by air strikes and by troops operating inside southern Lebanon over the past day. Meanwhile, Hezbollah\u2019s new secretary general, Naim Qassem, said in a speech that the group had \u201ctens of thousands of trained resistance combatants\u201d ready to fight and that nowhere in Israel was \u201cbeyond the reach of our drones and missiles\u201d. \"I will tell you very clearly, our conviction is that only one thing can stop this war of aggression, and that is the battlefield,\" he declared, adding that he did not believe \"political action\" would end the conflict. The Israeli military said Hezbollah fired about 170 rockets into northern and central Israel on Wednesday. In the evening, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said a man was killed by a rocket near the kibbutz of Kfar Masaryk, which is south of the coastal town of Acre. Paramedics said the man was found in a field with severe shrapnel wounds and that he was pronounced dead at the scene. Later, Israeli media identified him as Sivan Sade, an 18-year-old resident of Kfar Masaryk who had been working in the field.\n\nA large section of a Hezbollah rocket hit a parked car in the town of Raanana, near Tel Aviv\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Israeli media said one rocket hit a car park near Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport, but the Israel Airport Authority said its operations were not affected. Hezbollah said it targeted the Tzrifin military base near the airport. A large section of a rocket also hit a parked car in the town of Raanana, just north of Tel Aviv. Since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah six weeks ago, at least 2,400 people have been killed and more than 1.2 million displaced across Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities. Israeli air strikes have eliminated most of the group\u2019s leadership, including Qassem\u2019s predecessor Hassan Nasrallah, and caused widespread destruction in parts of southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It says it wants to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Israeli authorities say more than 70 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights over the past year.",
    "Amorim vows to restore Man Utd to where club 'belongs'\n\nManchester United's first home game under Ruben Amorim will be against Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League on 28 November\n\nManchester United's new head coach Ruben Amorim says he is confident of putting the club back where it \"belongs\". Amorim flew into Manchester on Monday after being confirmed as Erik ten Hag\u2019s replacement. The 39-year-old is the seventh man since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 to take up the challenge of trying to get United competing for major trophies again. None of them has been able to engineer a sustained Premier League title push, taken United beyond the last eight of the Champions League or completed three full seasons in the job. In his first public comments since arriving in the UK, former Sporting boss Amorim told United's club media he is determined to change that narrative. \"I will try to do everything to put this club in the place that it belongs,\" he said. \"And I believe a lot that we are going to succeed.\"\n\nUnited have posted a number social media images of Amorim meeting players, executives and some fans who were on a tour of Old Trafford when he walked into the home dressing room. He has also tried to soak in some of the club's storied past. Not just the record 20 English titles and three European Cups but also the dark days of the Munich air disaster and the rise to glory under Sir Matt Busby. While most supporters were not alive when that happened, Amorim feels it is important players understand the magnitude of the club they are playing for. \"You see the trophies and you see the tragedy that we have as a club,\" he said. \"You understand the history, after the crash, then we were European champions. It is important to put this kind of strength in the team. \"When the players come here, they should make the same tour. It is very important. You have to feel this is Manchester United.\" As the players he met earlier in the week, including England trio Kobbie Mainoo, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount, were all doing rehabilitation, it will be next week before Amorim will really get to work. Alejandro Garnacho and Manuel Ugarte have World Cup qualifying commitments in South America in the early hours of Wednesday morning UK time, so it will likely be Friday before he has his full squad together to prepare for his first game in charge, at Ipswich, on 24 November. Amorim accepts not everything will be to his satisfaction. But he is promising fans they will see a team that is inherently his. \"The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character we had in the past,\" he said. \"We will focus a lot on our game model - how to play, how to press, these small things. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. But if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, it is identity.\" Judgement around Amorim's appointment will be made against United's new structure, from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, through board member Sir Dave Brailsford, chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox. Berrada has been the driving force behind Amorim's appointment, with Ashworth and Wilcox the executives he will be working with most closely. Amorim says he feels there is a strong connection already and he can see the excitement around Ineos' wider plans for the club. \"We want to do something special in a special club - that was a key point,\u201d he said. \"When Manchester United told me about their plans, you get excited. We know if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. \"It's a real honour that I was the first choice to start that path.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

A young girl aged six or seven was among the dead, he added. People were sitting on benches under the outdoor overhang at the station in Novi Sad, Serbia's second city, at the time of the collapse around noon local time (11:00 GMT), Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) reported. Three people are in hospital. Among them are two women who were pulled alive from under the rubble a few hours after the collapse.\n\nIn an address to the nation, Mr Vu\u010di\u0107 said he hoped the number of dead would not rise beyond 14, adding that five of those killed had still not been identified. \"Those responsible, I assure you, will be punished,\" he said, quoted by AFP. Around 80 rescuers from all over the country are involved in the search, using heavy machinery, which is still ongoing. The railway station building was renovated in 2021, and renovated again this year in order to be officially opened on 5 July. Serbian media quoted Railway Infrastructure of Serbia, the body responsible for the concrete canopy, as saying it had not been reconstructed with the station. It was built in 1964. Prime Minister Milo\u0161 Vu\u010devi\u0107 said Friday was one of the most difficult days in Novi Sad's post-war history. \"This is a great, terrible tragedy for Novi Sad and for all of Serbia,\" he added, sending condolences to the families of the victims and thanking first responders.

    "Huw Edwards was given a six month suspended jail sentence at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in September\n\nA man has accused former news presenter Huw Edwards of attempting to \u201cgroom\u201d him when he was 18 and still in school. Saying he behaved inappropriately towards him, the man - now in his early 20s - said Edwards invited him to the BBC\u2019s London offices when he was a pupil. He alleged Edwards messaged him offers of help with his career, adding that he now sees them as something more. A BBC spokesperson said \"robust safeguarding policies are in place\" regarding site visits and careful consideration would be given to any concerns.\n\nThe young man, who requested anonymity, shared with Y Byd ar Bedwar - S4C\u2019s current affairs programme - a series of messages where Edwards referred to him as \u201cbabe\u201d and \u201cbig boy\u201d and signed off with kisses. He also says he was invited to the BBC\u2019s London offices by the former News at Ten presenter. Shortly after he visited the premises he said Edwards cut all contact with him. \"I think it\u2019s obvious he was grooming me, trying to pull me in,\" he said. \"I remember him asking me to meet him, then telling me not to worry if I couldn't, which he followed with a few kisses. \u201cI look at this now and think, 'He\u2019s just playing with me'.\n\n\u201cI feel angry about the way he\u2019s treated people and because others have had much worse experiences than me. After pleading guilty to making indecent images of children, 63-year-old Edwards was given a six month suspended jail sentence at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in September. He had 41 illegal images of children on his phone, including an image of a child approximately aged between seven and nine. Journalist and presenter Beti George, who has worked regularly with Edwards, said: \"Something has happened to Huw. \"I don\u2019t know what, but the Huw I know or thought I knew would never do something like that. \"Who in their right mind would do such a thing? There is no justification for it.\"\n\nEdwards, who joined the BBC in 1984, was one of the UK's most high-profile broadcasters\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"We have been clear that we are appalled by Huw Edwards\u2019 crimes. \"He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him.\" They added that a board-commissioned independent review of the BBC\u2019s workplace culture is under way, focusing on preventing abuse of power and ensuring everyone at the BBC conducts themselves in line with company values. \"The BBC has robust safeguarding policies and processes in place and if people contact us directly with concerns we will look at these carefully, in line with our complaints framework,\" they added. Y Byd ar Bedwar, external's makers made repeated attempts to contact Edwards, but he did not respond to their messages.",
    "Viktoriia Roshchyna was detained last year while reporting in Russian-occupied Ukraine\n\nViktoriia Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 in a part of Ukraine now occupied by Russian forces. It took nine months for Russian authorities to confirm the journalist had been detained. They gave no reason. This week, her father got a terse letter from the defence ministry in Moscow informing him that Viktoriia was dead, aged 27. The document said the journalist\u2019s body would be returned in one of the swaps organised by Russia and Ukraine for soldiers killed on the battlefield. The death date was given as 19 September. Again, there was no explanation.\n\nThis weekend, friends gathered to remember Viktoriia on the Maidan in central Kyiv. They shuffled into position on the steps holding her photograph, young face smiling out at the small crowd. \u201cShe had huge courage,\u201d one woman began the tributes. \u201cWe will miss her enormously,\u201d said another, turning away as her eyes filled with tears. Viktoriia\u2019s stories were snapshots of life that Ukrainians were not getting from anywhere else. Reporting from occupied areas of Ukraine was extremely dangerous, but her colleagues remember how she was desperate to go there, even after she was detained and held in custody the first time, for ten days.\n\nFormer colleagues held a vigil in Kyiv to remember Viktoriia Roshchyna\n\n\u201cHer parents used to call and tell us to stop deploying her, but we never did deploy her!\u201d one of her former bosses recalled. \u201cAll her editors tried to stop her. But it was impossible.\u201d The young reporter eventually went freelance in order to deploy herself and when she got back newspapers would buy her reports. Most strikingly, she never used a pseudonym even though she wrote openly of \"occupied\" territory and referred to those who collaborated with the Russians as \"traitors\". \u201cShe wanted to provide information about how those cities live under siege by the Russian army,\u201d Sevgil Musaieva, editor-in-chief at Ukrayinska Pravda, told the BBC.\n\nViktoriia's father has previously described how she set out via Poland and Russia last July, heading for occupied Ukraine. It was a week before she called to say she\u2019d been interrogated at the border for several days. All we know for sure after that, is that by May she was in Detention Centre No. 2 in Taganrog, southern Russia \u2013 a facility so notorious for the brutal treatment of many Ukrainians that some dub it the \"Russian Guantanamo\". According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, another Ukrainian citizen who was released from Taganrog last month has told Viktoriia\u2019s family she saw the journalist on 8 or 9 September. Then, there was cause for hope. \u201cI was 100% sure she\u2019d be back on 13 September this year. My sources gave me 100% guarantees,\u201d Musaieva, from Ukrayinska Pravda, says. She had been told Viktoriia would be included in one of the periodic prisoner-of-war swaps that Ukraine and Russia carry out, planned for the middle of last month. \u201cSo what happened with her in prison? Why didn\u2019t she come home?\u201d\n\nSevgil Musaieva says her colleague wanted to shine a light on the hardships of life in cities occupied by the Russian army\n\nViktoriia was moved, with another Ukrainian woman, but neither were included in the prisoner exchange. \u201cThat means she was taken somewhere else,\" says Media Initiative director Tetyana Katrychenko. \"They say to Lefortovo. Why there? We don\u2019t know.\" She says it\u2019s not normal practice ahead of a swap. Lefortovo prison in Moscow is run by the FSB security service and used for those accused of espionage and serious crimes against the state. \u201cMaybe they took her there to start some kind of court proceeding or investigation. That\u2019s happened to other civilians taken from Kherson and Melitopol,\u201d Tetyana says. The BBC understands that Viktoriia\u2019s father had spoken to her in prison on 30 August. At some point, she had called a hunger strike, but that day her father urged her to start eating again and she agreed. \u201cThat needs investigating. It also means we\u2019d be blaming her, partially, and not the Russian Federation, as we should,\u201d Tetyana cautions. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service has confirmed Viktoriia\u2019s death and the General Prosecutor\u2019s office has changed its criminal case from illegal detention to murder. In Russia, Viktoriia was never charged with any crime and the circumstances of her detention are not known. \u201cA civilian journalist \u2026 captured by Russia. Then Russia sends a letter that she died?\u201d Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn told the BBC in Kyiv. \u201cIt's killing. Just the killing of hostages. I don't know other word.\u201d\n\nSince the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, huge numbers of civilians have been taken from areas of Ukraine that Moscow has overrun and now controls. Like Viktoriia\u2019s family, desperate relatives are left with little or no information on their whereabouts or wellbeing, and no idea whether they\u2019ll ever get home. So far, the Media Initiative has collated a list of 1,886 names. \"There\u2019s all sorts of people, including ex-soldiers and police officers and local officials like mayors,\u201d Tetyana says. \u201cAnd of course there may be many more we don\u2019t know about.\u201d Neither lawyers nor the Red Cross get access and even if someone\u2019s location can be confirmed, getting them back home is almost impossible: civilians are rarely swapped.\n\nRoshchyna's colleague Nataliya Humenyuk said in a tribute on social media that she left behind a great legacy\n\nViktoriia\u2019s friends and colleagues say they won\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve investigated what happened. \u201cHer life was her work,\u201d Angelina Karyakina, a former editor at Hromadske says. \u201cIt's a rare type of people who are so determined.\u201d \u201cI'm pretty sure the way she would want us to remember her is not to stand here and cry, but to remember her dignity,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think what\u2019s important for us journalists, is to find out what she was working on \u2013 and to finish her story.\u201d",

    "New deals with Balkan states to target people smugglers\n\nThe UK has signed new agreements with western Balkan countries to tackle people-smuggling gangs, as part of efforts to bring down small boat crossings. The deals will increase intelligence sharing and cooperation with Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo to intercept and arrest the gangs, with the aim of breaking their business models at source. The government said the region was a key route used by those who end up in the European Union or UK illegally, with almost 100,000 migrants transiting through the western Balkans last year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the plans at a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) in Hungarian capital Budapest on Thursday.\n\nMore than 31,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year - more than the same period last year. The UK already has agreements with countries including Albania and Turkey to share intelligence to disrupt people-smuggling gangs. Sir Keir said: \"There is a criminal empire operating on our continent, exacting a horrendous human toll and undermining our national security.\" He said the UK would be \"at the heart of the efforts to end the scourge of organised immigration crime\" but \"we cannot do it in isolation\". He added: \"We need to go further and faster, alongside our international partners, and take the fight directly to the heart of these vile people smuggling networks.\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Working more closely with Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo, we will share information and intelligence, and work across borders to map out what is happening and where, to break the business models of these unscrupulous gangs at source.\"\n\nIt comes after the government announced an extra \u00a375m funding for the UK's new Border Security Command, which brings together police, intelligence and immigration enforcement agencies to tackle small boat crossings. Graeme Biggar, the National Crime Agency's (NCA) director general, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that continuing to work with international partners was \"crucial\". He added that it is \"very difficult to have exact confidence\" on how much measures would reduce the number of UK small boat crossings as \"so much depends on what's happening with the rest of the world\". On tackling people-smuggling gangs, Mr Biggar said that what is \"particularly hard\" for the NCA \"is that the people themselves are not illegal, their presence in the UK or in some countries on the way here may be illegal, and often the tools that they are using to get here are not themselves illegal - boats and engines\". \"So being able to prove a criminal conspiracy is quite hard,\" he added. The EPC was set up in 2022 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a way of bringing together European heads of government for informal talks and improving cooperation. The group includes the 27 members of the EU as well as 20 other European countries.",
    "Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have agreed the relationship between the UK and US is \"incredibly strong\" and will \"continue to thrive\", Downing Street has said. In the first phone call between the pair after the US election, the PM offered his \"hearty congratulations\" to Trump after his \"historic victory\" and said he looked forward to working closely with the President-elect, a No 10 spokeswoman said. It comes after Kemi Badenoch urged Sir Keir to apologise for \"derogatory\" comments made about Trump by David Lammy before he was foreign secretary. In her first appearance in Parliament as Conservative leader, she pressed Sir Keir on how Trump's election would affect UK policies on trade and defence.\n\nBadenoch asked the prime minister if he would push for Trump to get an invitation to address Parliament, but did not receive a direct reply. In their phone call, Downing Street said the pair also discussed the situation in the Middle East and the PM \"underscored the importance of regional stability\". \"The leaders fondly recalled their meeting in September, and President-elect Trump\u2019s close connections and affinity to the United Kingdom and looked forward to working with one another,\" a spokeswoman added. Sir Keir and his foreign secretary held a dinner with Trump in New York in September, when the pair met for the first time.\n\nIn opposition, Lammy labelled Trump a \"neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath\" but since getting into government has sought to build bridges with the president-elect and his team. Earlier, the PM's spokeswoman was pressed on whether Lammy would keep his job for the entire Parliament in light of his past comments, and replied: \"Yes, he is the foreign secretary.\"\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch said the US was the UK's single biggest trade partner and warned the prime minister he would need to \"look after the special relationship\". She said there was now a \"risk of increased tariffs on UK exports\" and asked if he would revisit talks on establishing a free trade agreement with the US. Since leaving the European Union, UK ministers have been keen to reach a trade deal with the US - however, there has been little progress. During his election campaign, Trump pledged to dramatically increase tariffs on foreign exports. Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: \"Of course we will discuss issues of our economy with the president-elect, as we already have done.\" Later, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told MPs on the cross-party Treasury Select Committee the UK's trading relationship with the US was \"crucial\", but she was \"confident those trade flows will continue under President Trump\". She added: \"[He's] been President before, we continue to have a good and strong economic relationship... I\u2019m optimistic about our ability to shape the global economic agenda.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: PM and Badenoch congratulate Trump on US election victory\n\nOn defence, Badenoch echoed calls from Trump that European countries should increase their defence spending and urged the prime minister to match her party's commitment to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030. Sir Keir reiterated his government's commitment to the 2.5% target - although it has not set a deadline for meeting the goal. He added that, unlike the previous Labour government, the Conservatives had failed to meet the target while in office. He also attacked the Conservatives for leaving a \u00a317bn black hole in the Ministry of Defence's finances.\n\nLabour accused Badenoch of misleading Parliament when she incorrectly told MPs that the \u201cchancellor's Budget did not even mention defence\u201d. Badenoch's spokesman insisted she had not got it wrong because it was \"obvious\" from the context of what she had said in her previous question that \u201cshe was referring to the fact that there was no reference to how Labour intend to get to that 2.5%\u201d. In her Budget speech last week, the chancellor said \u201cwe will set a path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence at a future fiscal event.\u201d\n\nScottish First Minister John Swinney said Scotland and the US \"share many social, cultural and economic links\". \"In that relationship, we will stand fast in support of our values of fairness, democracy and equality \u2013 ideals that America was built upon.\" Badenoch said: \"The world faces many serious challenges and I look forward to our two countries working together to confront them.\" Nigel Farage, Reform UK leader and a friend of Trump, said the president-elect was a \"genuine friend of the United Kingdom\" and urged the prime minister to \"roll out the red carpet\" for him. \"This is a huge opportunity to be grasped.\"\n\nOther UK party leaders have been more critical. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called the election result, external \"a dark, dark day for people around the globe\". \"The world\u2019s largest economy and most powerful military will be led by a dangerous, destructive demagogue. \"Fixing the UK\u2019s broken relationship with the EU is even more urgent than before - we must strengthen trade and defence cooperation across Europe to help protect ourselves from the damage Trump will do.\" \"On this dark day, we stand in solidarity with all US citizens who fear a convicted criminal and a fascist in the White House.\" And Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has repeatedly clashed with Trump, said many Londoners would feel \"anxious\" and \"fearful\" about what the outcome of the election would mean for democracy, women's rights, the Middle East, Ukraine or tackling the climate crisis.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Ramez Abu Nasr managed to save his brother from the rubble\n\nWarning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and violence The hand was covered in dust, streaked with blood on the fingers and wrist, all that could be seen of the person who was killed. Like many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north. A teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive. But then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers. They leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men. In the narrow streets men dug with their hands. But there were no sounds coming from the rubble now. Whoever lay there was beyond help.\n\nThe Abu Nasr family were entombed by falling masonry after Israeli air strikes\n\nRamez Abu Nasr was digging for hours. His mother, father and brothers were entombed by the falling masonry. Ramez managed to save his youngest brother. The boy told him that he had heard his parents nearby, reciting the Shehada, the Muslim prayer of faith. Soon after they were silent. \u201cI took out my younger brother at the last moment. I don\u2019t know how we can go back to our home... without my mother, or father, or brothers,\u201d says Ramez. The family fled here from Jabalia when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began their renewed offensive against Hamas in the north twelve days ago. The IDF issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many thousands stayed behind, exhausted by constant displacement, fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies.\n\nInside a house that is still standing, a young man kneels in front of his dead sister. She looks to be in her thirties. \u201cOh God, my sister, my sister,\u201d he calls out. Civil Defence volunteers are gathering bodies from inside buildings. They find a badly wounded man and race to the ambulance. They are trying to save a life, but also are afraid of being bombed themselves. Ahmed al Kahlout from the local Civil Defence looked around him at the carnage. Behind him, a colleague tries to give CPR to a woman. It is hopeless. \"This is the al-Sayyed family house,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cThere are bodies, torn parts in this area... It is a horrible crime.\u201d Several ambulances are lined up in the streets. Most of those inside them are dead. Bodies are piled up. All ages. Blood seeps from the forehead of a small child. A woman, wrapped in a brightly coloured blanket is loaded beside her. Next to the ambulance a dead man, middle aged, is lying on a hospital trolley.\n\nMany of the casualties are taken to Jabalia\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital. It's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiyyah, told me by phone that his hospital faced a dire humanitarian crisis and accused Israel of imposing collective punishment. \"We urge the world to intervene and impose their humanity over the Israeli army, to open humanitarian corridors that allow the entrance of medical tools, delegations, fuel, and food so that we can provide humanitarian services for the children, newborn babies, and patients who are in need,\u201d he said. The United States has accused Israel of refusing or impeding up to 90% of aid to northern Gaza in the last month - and threatened to cut arms shipments unless there is change. Israel says it is taking American concerns seriously and is \u201caddressing the issue\". International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel. The IDF says it only targets \u201cterror cells\u201d and released a video of what it said was Hamas firing from within a clinic in Jabalia. The army also said they\u2019d found weapons and boobytraps in a medical facility. In the video an officer, his face blurred, points to booby traps and weapons and speaks to the camera: \u201cEverything here is a cynical exploitation of the civilian population, inside a clinic, inside a civilian compound. We will pursue these terrorists and find them in every corner.\u201d In Jabalia, a heavily pregnant woman is sitting in the dust outside a house.

    "Alex Salmond led his party from the political fringe to power at Holyrood\n\nAlex Salmond was a man and a politician of extreme contradictions. A one-time radical firebrand, he moved his party from the political margins and perpetual opposition to government and the mainstream of Scottish public life. He was a gambler and divider of opinions who became a rock-steady first minister with a mission to show voters that he could govern for all, using devolution to prove independence was nothing to be frightened of. And he was a powerful communicator who would see his reputation diminished amid allegations of sexual misconduct, a criminal trial and exile from the SNP. His death at the age of 69 brings to an end a remarkable life and political career and an important chapter in the story of the independence movement. Salmond's reputation as a political heavyweight ensured he was a high-profile politician across the UK long before he won Holyrood's top job. In a BBC Scotland profile in 2011, former Conservative cabinet member Michael Portillo described him as the only Scottish politician to become well known in England and internationally while spending most of his career in Scottish politics. \"I regard him as the outstanding politician not to have come out of Scotland, but to have remained in Scotland,\" he said.\n\nSalmond was born and raised in Linlithgow, West Lothian\n\nBorn on Hogmanay 1954 in Linlithgow, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond grew up in a town soaked in Scottish history and tradition. A talented boy soprano, he sang in St Michael's Parish Church. The 15th Century kirk, which stands next to Linlithgow Palace, was a place of royal worship and the site of Mary Queen of Scots' baptism. Salmond described his parents as working class nationalists with a small \u2018n\u2019. He was proud to have grown up in a council house, educated in Scotland's distinctly egalitarian school system built on the Kirk's traditions. From there he made his way to the University of St Andrews, where he studied economics and medieval history and joined the SNP almost immediately after arriving there in 1973. The party was just about to take off, achieving 30% of the vote and sending 11 MPs to Westminster in the election of October 1974. A contemporary at St Andrews, future BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor, later remembered him as a \"mischief maker\" at St Andrews. \"If he had two options to make a political point, he would always use the one which allowed him to make mischief as well as making the point,\" he said. \"But he was also a brilliantly focussed politician. He was president of the Federation of Nationalist Students, and he was very focussed. He was easily the same quality as his political contemporaries such as Gordon Brown down in Edinburgh.\" After university, the radical young political activist who wanted to bring about the end of the United Kingdom state then embarked on a career right at the heart of it. In 1978, he entered the Government Economic Service (GES) as an assistant economist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, part of the now defunct Scottish Office. After two years later he moved to the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked for seven years as an economist, eventually coming to specialise in oil and gas.\n\nAlex Salmond was first elected to Westminster in 1987\n\nBut all the while the world of politics was exerting its pull. An active member of the SNP, he played a prominent role in the party's dissident 79 Group. They wanted to move the SNP to the left, seeking the support of working-class and disaffected Labour voters who were unhappy at the failure of their party to deliver the promised Scottish Assembly. The group was expelled from the party in 1982 but his colleagues saw Salmond as too talented to be left out in the cold and brought the trouble-makers back into the ranks. By the late 1980s, as Thatcherism swept across Scotland and the country felt the full force of her economic policies on its industrial sector, Salmond was seen as a rising star and potential future leader. Elected as MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987, he quickly made his mark by getting himself banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the chancellor's Budget speech in protest at the introduction of the community charge in Scotland. When the job of party leader came up in 1990, Salmond made his move and won, perhaps surprisingly repositioning the SNP as more centrist, socially democratic and pro-European.\n\nAlex Salmond led his party - and close colleagues John Swinney, Nicola Sturgeon and Michael Russell - into the Scottish Parliament in 1999\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Salmond became a familiar figure on radio and television and a great favourite of the UK press. An effective political analyst and communicator, he derided the Thatcher and Major governments before turning his criticism on New Labour and Tony Blair. He also increased his command of the SNP. His grip over its senior members and processes was total. He built close support from key comrades such as party chief executive Michael Russell and younger talents including Nicola Sturgeon, who would become his protege and eventual deputy. Salmond led the party into joining the \"Yes-Yes\" campaign for a Scottish parliament, arguing the \"gradualist\" rather than \"fundamentalist\" approach to gaining independence. The SNP came second at the inaugural Holyrood election in 1999 and Salmond appeared to enjoy the role of chief opposition leader. A witty and brilliant debater, he did not always show the best judgement. As Nato planes bombed Serbia in retaliation for its attacks on Kosovo, he opposed the conflict because it was not authorised by a United Nations Security Council resolution. Salmond described the Nato action as \"an act of dubious legality, but, above all, one of unpardonable folly\" and was heavily criticised for his comments.\n\nSalmond was the lead MP calling for the impeachment of Tony Blair over the war in Iraq\n\nIn 2000, Salmond made the surprise decision to quit and stand down as both leader and MSP. He returned to Westminster, a move which underlined a common criticism that the man calling for Scotland's \"freedom\" was more at home in London. But he was also in demand as an acute critic of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the close personal and political relationship between UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush. Salmond was one of 11 MPs who attempted unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Blair. His actions, as well as his presence on marches and speeches at protests, made him a leading figure in the anti-war movement and won him many admirers. But his absence from Edinburgh during this period was not good for his party. John Swinney had succeeded him as leader, but stood down in 2004 following a string of dismal election results, criticism from across his party and the negative publicity of a leadership challenge. As that summer progressed, there were persistent rumours that Salmond was considering a return. He responded by borrowing a line from General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: \"If nominated, I'll decline. If drafted, I'll defer. And if elected, I'll resign.\" Always partial to a dramatic flourish, Salmond announced he had changed his mind just before nominations closed, having cut a deal with candidate Nicola Sturgeon which saw her agree to be his number two. He told journalists he was not just launching a campaign to be SNP leader, but his \"candidacy to be first minister of Scotland\". He promised to unite what had become a fractious Scottish parliamentary party, and focus on winning the 2007 election. And that he did, by the narrowest of margins. He formed a minority government and relied on Green and Conservative support to get his manifesto through one vote at a time. For the more radical elements of his party, this might have been seen as sleeping with the enemy. But Salmond recognised working across the chamber was both necessary and desirable.\n\nThe one-time republican enjoyed both the trappings of the office and a good relationship with the Queen\n\nHe was comfortable in the role of first minister and went about government in a measured, positive way. There was less of the smart-Alex of old and it was clear he took the job seriously. Salmond had been in the role for just over a month when Islamist terrorists rammed the front entrance of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport. His handling of the crisis was met with acclaim and he worked closely with Gordon Brown's government in London. But over the coming few years there would be clashes over the decision to release the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, and the handling of the financial crisis. Salmond was accused of taking a \"cavalier\" approach to dealing with US tycoon Donald Trump's \u00a31bn Scottish golf resort. An inquiry into the affair by Holyrood's local government committee raised concerns over the Scottish government's decision to call in the plans, following their rejection by Aberdeenshire Council, after \"two five-minute phone calls\". The probe concluded the decision, although unprecedented, was competent. It was a typical Salmond approach to problem-solving.\n\nSalmond was considered as having out-foxed Prime Minister David Cameron when negotiating the Edinburgh Agreement on the independence referendum\n\nIn many ways, 2011 marked the high point of Salmond's political career. He pulled off what had always been descibed as the impossible - winning a majority at a Scottish parliamentary election. Over the course of the following three years, Salmond was credited with out-smarting Prime Minister David Cameron and his coalition government colleagues, winning crucial battles over the timing and structure of the vote and the wording of the question which would be put to voters. The official campaign was meant to take place in the autumn of 2014 but in reality the battle lasted the three-and-a-half years between election and referendum. Rival campaigns were meant to take the debate out of the politicians' hands but in the end it came down to Salmond trading blows with Labour's Alastair Darling in a series of televised debates.\n\nSalmond was a natural campaigner and the focus of enormous attention in the run up to the referendum\n\nThe FM was strong on rhetoric and vision, projecting an optimistic view of a future Scotland that could do anything it wanted; prosperous and fair, unshackled from the union with England but close to its European allies. He was less sure on dealing with Scotland's structural deficit, what currency would be used and how state pensions would be funded and paid. In the end, the result was a \"No\" to independence. Salmond had failed. That he had led his side to a 45% share was a remarkable achievement that provided little succour. Within hours, he announced his resignation. Almost 60, it was time to hand over the fight to a younger generation. His close friend and loyal deputy Nicola Sturgeon was his chosen successor. He chose to stand again for Westminster, winning Gordon as part of the SNP surge of 2015, when the party won 56 out 59 seats, significantly enhancing its power in the Commons. But it was short-lived. He lost the seat just two years later, bringing to an end a political career spread more than 30 years and two parliaments.\n\nSalmond brought his Unleashed show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017\n\nThe following years were sometimes awkward for his supporters and admirers. His decision to host a chat show on RT, the former Russia Today channel editorially controlled by Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, was a source of criticism and embarrassment to his party. That was suspended in February 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A year later a programme with the same format began broadcasting on Turkish public television. There was an Edinburgh Fringe chat show in 2017 which included a rather crude innuendo about Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and Melania Trump. It prompted his successor as leader, Nicola Sturgeon, to comment that: \u201cOccasionally Alex is not as funny as he thinks he is.\" It was a minor hint at tension between the two and the joke would look even more unfortunate in the light of what was to come later.\n\nIn August 2018 the Daily Record newspaper revealed Salmond had been reported to police over sexual assault allegations dating back to his time as first minister. He denied the claims and said he was taking the Scottish government to court to challenge the complaints procedure which had been activated against him. A week later he resigned from the SNP after 45 years. He said he wanted to avoid internal division within the party, which was facing calls to suspend him. The subsequent parliamentary inquiry revealed that, in the nine or so months leading up to the initial story breaking, a complicated series of meetings and conversations had taken place between those at the top of the SNP and those at the top of the Scottish government, often confusing the division between the two. Mistakes in the complaints process were such that in January 2019 Salmond won a judicial review, ruling the investigation was unlawful, unfair and \"tainted by apparent bias\". He was later awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in costs.\n\nSalmond left court after his trial an innocent man but with his reputation damaged\n\nThat same month he appeared in court and was charged with 14 offences, including two counts of attempted rape. In 2020, after two weeks of evidence, he was acquitted of every charge. But the testimony was devastating for his public image. Salmond's advocate, Gordon Jackson KC, admitted that his client had sometimes behaved badly, calling him \"touchy-feely\". Details of inappropriate behaviour included Salmond admitting having a \"sleepy cuddle\" with one complainer, and what Mr Jackson called \"a bit of how's your father\" with another - both younger members of his staff, neither of them his wife. The KC said in his closing speech that the former first minister \"could certainly have been a better man\". There was also confirmation of what had long been whispered; that Salmond could bully colleagues and staff. Witnesses called him \"extraordinarily pugnacious\" and \"extremely demanding\". Two subsequent inquiries into the conduct of ministers and officials saw Salmond asserting his belief that many in his former party had colluded against him in an effort to block any final return to frontline politics.\n\nSalmond's final political project - the Alba Party - was not electorally successful\n\nYet there was to be a final return, as leader of the newly-formed Alba party. Launched just ahead of the 2021 Holyrood election, it attracted a few defections from his old party but never achieved more than 3% at the ballot box. Salmond never wavered from his belief that independence was necessary, desirable and inevitable for Scotland. His enthusiasm for the cause did not extend to his former comrades in the campaign, however. He was often brutally critical of Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney, his one time proteges and friends who succeeded him into Bute House. Away from politics, Salmond was something of an enigma. He and wife Moira, who never had children, closely protected their private lives. He loved golf, football and horse racing and was said to be a keen reader. Love him or loathe him, few would dispute Alex Salmond's skill and achievements as a politician. He never achieved his dream of independence but as one of the most talented politicians of his generation, he took the SNP as close to its goal as it had ever been.",
    "Holly says positive relationships for disabled people need better representation\n\nHolly was just 16 when someone asked her if she could have sex because she was disabled. She has been asked many other questions over the years, such as if she \"can have rough sex\" or if it needs to be in a wheelchair. \"People think they're doing you a favour, almost like a sacrifice.

Will your joints dislocate? If I wanted to have rough sex with you, would I be able to?\" Holly said people have also messaged her on social media about sex, an offer she was often made to feel she should be \"lucky\" for. Holly would like to see better positive representation in the media, citing that the character Isaac Goodwin in the programme Sex Education was the only good example she has been aware of recently.\n\nHolly married James in September and says he has always supported her with her health\n\nNicola Thomas, 38, from Caerphilly, who is registered blind, said: \"One of the more common things people will ask is, how do you have sex? It kind of takes your breath back, it's such an invasive and personal question.\" Nicola has an auto immune disease - neuromyelitis optica , external- and she lost her sight in one eye 15 years ago and the other five years ago. \"A lot of people see barriers with blindness and I'm definitely one to break those down.\" Nicola's hobbies include sailing, paddleboarding and travelling, and her next trip is to Hong Kong.\n\nNicola and her boyfriend Paul love traveling the world together\n\nNicola had a boyfriend when she lost her sight but the relationship broke down. \"I was treated like a burden, people would say you can't be a carer for her, but I didn't need a carer.\" She now has a boyfriend who is also visually impaired. \"Even though we're both blind, we'll navigate our way round a city, or go on a date on our own. Nothing holds us back.\" Nicola also said she feels stereotyped when people show an interest in her. \"People message on social media asking for dates, their attention shifts or acts differently when I tell them I'm blind.\" \"You're definitely treated like they're doing you a favour. It puts you off instantly.\" Nicola added: \"People do pigeon hole us. I want to breakdown that stereotype, I have a full and happy life.\"\n\n\"When you're disabled you're well acquainted with poverty but it's more than a monetary value, a healthy relationship is definitely a poverty.\"\n\nKat Watkins said disabled people have a right to explore their sexual identity and develop relationships just like anybody else. She is the access to politics project officer for Disability Wales. \"Why are sex and relationships such a taboo for disabled people? There is much more to us than just being able to eat and having a roof over our heads.\" \"Living your life and enjoying yourself that's just part of life, and it doesn't get highlighted enough for people with disabilities.\" Kat said hearing examples of how people message disabled women was \"sadly normalised.\" She said adaptable sex toys and aids can help give people confidence and would like to see them on more mainstream sex sites and outlets. \"You've got to be comfortable with yourself and understand your body, so you can tell others how it works.

    "Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak\n\nIsrael\u2019s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors. They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens. At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel\u2019s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States. In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran\u2019s Islamic regime.\n\nIran\u2019s official media in the hours before and after Israel\u2019s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel\u2019s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back. That is the hope of Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America\u2019s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence. \"I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,\u201d he said. \"I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond.\" Iran\u2019s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey\u2019s NTV network that \"any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.\u201d Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: \"Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force.\" It was, he said, \"highly misleading and baseless\" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack. As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran\u2019s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence \"as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter\". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.\n\nIsrael has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel. That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies. The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called \"axis of resistance\" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes. Six months into the war, Israel\u2019s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action. When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran\u2019s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices. Israel interpreted Iran\u2019s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden\u2019s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel. On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran\u2019s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden\u2019s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel\u2019s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan. Biden apparently asked Israel to \"take the win\" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden\u2019s plan seemed to be working.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel\n\nBut since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran\u2019s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon. But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah\u2019s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed. Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal. Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel\u2019s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor. Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza\u2019s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation. It\u2019s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome air defence system intercepted most of Iran's missile attack on 1 October\n\nIt is hard to stop successive rounds of strikes and counter strikes when the countries concerned believe they will be seen as weak, and deterred, if they don\u2019t respond. That is how wars spin out of control. The question now is whether Iran is prepared to give Israel the last word, at least on this stage of the war. President Biden backed Israel\u2019s decision to retaliate after 1 October. But once again he tried to head off an even deadlier escalation, telling Israel publicly not to bomb Iran\u2019s most important assets, its nuclear, oil and gas installations. He augmented Israel\u2019s defences by deploying the THAAD anti-missile system to Israel, and prime minister Netanyahu agreed to take his advice. The American elections on 5 November are part of both Israel and Iran\u2019s calculations about what happens next. If Donald Trump gets his second term, he might be less concerned than Biden about answering Iranian retaliation, if it happens, with strikes on nuclear, oil and gas facilities. Once again, the Middle East is waiting. Israel\u2019s decision not to hit Iran\u2019s most valuable assets might, perhaps, give Tehran the chance to postpone a response, at least long enough for diplomats to do their work. At the UN General Assembly last month, the Iranians were suggesting that they were open to a new round of nuclear negotiations. All this should matter greatly to the world outside the Middle East. Iran has always denied it wants a nuclear bomb. But its nuclear expertise and enrichment of uranium have put a weapon within its reach. Its leaders must be looking for a new way to deter their enemies. Developing a nuclear warhead for their ballistic missiles might be on their agenda.",
    "For Shakhtar Donetsk, the stark realities of war in Ukraine are never far away.\n\nTwo days before they were due to play Kryvbas in September, the hotel they were set to be staying in was hit by a Russian missile.\n\nLocal media reported, external four people were killed and more injured in the attack in Kryvyi Rih, just over 40 miles from the nearest Russian-occupied territory and a regular target of air strikes.\n\n\"Can you imagine this, our team staying in this hotel and what can happen?\" Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"It is difficult to manage a team and difficult to attract new players in this kind of situation.

    "The operator of Pizza Hut's restaurants in the UK is looking to raise more than \u00a310m to help it cope with increased costs after tax rises on business were announced in last month's Budget. The money could come from a sale of part of the business, or new investment from existing shareholders. It comes amid growing backlash from business owners who warn, external rises in employers' national insurance contributions and the National Living Wage will push up costs for business which employ lots of low-wage workers. Heart With Smart (HWS) - which operates all 140 UK dine-in Pizza Hut restaurants - will use the money on new technology including touch-screen ordering kiosks and contactless table ordering.\n\nThe new features would allow restaurants to save money by operating with fewer staff and are already being trialled successfully in some Pizza Hut outlets, a company insider told the BBC. They said it would result in reduced staff levels, but the store does not expect a major redundancy programme. From April 2025 the rate of employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, which are paid by businesses on top of workers\u2019 salaries, will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the level where contributions start will fall to \u00a35,000. Combined with a 6.7% increase in the National Living Wage and an even bigger rise for 18 to 20-year-olds, HWS expects to see its labour costs rise \u00a34m, or about 14%, next year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has previously said businesses \"will have to absorb\" some of these costs through their profits.\n\nIn a letter with over 200 signatories, hospitality bosses last week, external told the chancellor the industry was disproportionately impacted by the \"unsustainable\" tax hike. They warned this would \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses. A number of businesses, including Sainsbury's, M&S, BT, Wetherspoons, Fullers and JD Sports have also hinted or warned that they may have to pass some of those extra costs on to customers by increasing prices. But HWS feels it has limited ability to do this as customers may not accept higher prices, the insider told the BBC. They said that the decision to raise the extra money is not just the result of Budget measures introduced last month. It is the effect of the changes on top of five difficult years for the restaurant business, following the pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis and labour costs which are already rising. The advisory firm Interpath has been hired to run the fundraising process, which was first reported by Sky News. Interpath has declined to comment. Asked about the impact of its tax rises on businesses, a government spokesperson said it \"had to make difficult choices... to restore desperately needed economic stability\".",
    "Mr Loverman stars Lennie James (right) as a man who has had a decades-long secret romance with a male friend\n\nAs BBC drama Mr Loverman airs, one activist remembers life as a gay, black man in the UK - and discusses how much has changed. In 1972, activist Theodore \"Ted\" Brown helped organise the UK's first Gay Pride in central London, which saw thousands march and gather for a mass kiss-in. Brown remembers being one of the few black people in attendance. In his view, Britain was \"more concerned with racism than homophobia\" at the time - but he remembers realising that the language of racism and homophobia were similar. Brown went on to co-found Black Lesbians and Gays Against Media Homophobia, an organisation fighting for the equality of British LGBT people - and has been campaigning for nearly 50 years. Brown came out as gay to his friends and family when he was 15 in 1965, two years before homosexuality was partially decriminalised in England and Wales. BBC drama Mr Loverman, based on the novel by Bernardine Evaristo, looks at life for black, gay men in the UK - like Brown - via the fictional Barrington Jedidiah Walker (played by Line of Duty star Lennie James). Walker is a seventy-four-year-old, Antiguan-born, exuberant Hackney personality, renowned for his dapper taste and fondness for retro suits - who has been having a secret, passionate affair with his best friend and soulmate, Morris (played by Ariyon Bakare). One critic, external called the series \"magnificent TV that will tear your heart open\".\n\nTed Brown (left) was part of the Gay Liberation movement in the 1970s alongside figures like Peter Tatchell (right)\n\nBoth characters are first-generation Windrush men, and the pair try to come out to Carmel, Walker's religious wife. The series explores the complexities of love and homosexuality in the black British community, and the wider impact of coming out as an older man leading a double life. Early in the series, for example, Walker hears his wife's friends from church refer to homosexuality as a \"disease\" and an \"abomination\". Later in the series, we see Walker being beaten up by a gang of white youths. Marc Thompson, an activist who was a consultant on Mr Loverman, says this serves to show that \"black communities are no more or less homophobic\" than others.\n\nMr Loverman explores the lives of multiple generations of black British LGBT people\n\nIn Walker's native Antigua, there were previously laws criminalising same-sex acts that had their roots in British colonial-era legislation forbidding \"buggery\" and \"indecency\". Lady Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, a human rights activist and CEO of UK Black Pride, argues that \"one of the many lasting legacies of the British Empire is the cultural impact of homophobia\".\n\nIn his decades of campaigning, Brown says he experienced physical violence \"a handful of times\". According to recent Home Office data, hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation have fallen for the second year in a row, to 22,839 reported incidents in England and Wales. But, in Brown's view: \"For young black men, the world can sometimes feel isolating.\" In earlier decades, public figures were sometimes subjected to abuse, like gay footballer Justin Fashanu, who is referenced in Mr Loverman. Nowadays, Brown says there have been changes in how black, gay men are perceived - and he instead sees a \"sense of pride and positive role models\". He adds: \"Today, TV, organisations, music, magazines, and websites allow black LGBTQ+ people to see themselves and connect, creating community.\" Indeed, there are now high-profile black LGBT figures including British Vogue cover star Munroe Bergdorf, number one Head & Heart singer-songwriter MNEK and Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes. According to Thompson, Mr Loverman \"tries to provide different perspectives about being black and LGBTQ+ across the decades\". He adds: \"Mr Loverman is a powerful reminder that black LGBTQ+ people have always been here and been part of our communities.\"",
    "New Zealand into semis after Pakistan all out for 56\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. New Zealand into T20 World Cup semis after Pakistan all out for 56\n\nNew Zealand booked their place in the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup with a comprehensive 54-run win over Pakistan in Dubai. Pakistan needed to chase their target of 111 within 10.4 overs to keep themselves in knockout contention via net run-rate, but paid the price for their aggressive intent by slumping to 56 all out in 11.4 overs. Despite collapsing to 28-5 after the six-over powerplay, the Pakistan batters kept attacking to keep their hopes alive rather than simply settle for a comfortable chase of less than a run-a-ball. New Zealand's batters had earlier struggled against Pakistan's spin attack, who expertly stifled the run-rate in the middle overs but were let down in the field with eight catches put down. Suzie Bates was dropped twice in her 28, the innings' top score, and then crucially three were put down in the final over which allowed Maddy Green and Izzy Gaze to scamper nine extra runs. But while their 110-6 felt below-par, New Zealand were rewarded for a disciplined all-round bowling effort with some assistance from Pakistan's chaotic but understandable approach. Leg-spinner Melie Kerr starred with 3-14 while fellow spinner Eden Carson took 2-7. It is New Zealand's first semi-final in either white-ball format since 2016, and they join six-time winners Australia from Group A with India eliminated. They will face the winner of Group B which will be either South Africa, England or West Indies, with the latter two teams playing on Tuesday.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFew would have had New Zealand as semi-final contenders before the tournament began as they came in with 10 straight T20 defeats, but started in sensational style by thumping potential winners India in their opener. And despite a heavy defeat by relentless Australia, they have continued to dominate against Sri Lanka and Pakistan to finish the group stage with plenty of momentum. The pre-match equation was simple, with a win of any margin enough, but there appeared to be some early nerves in the batting line-up given the pressure of the situation. Pakistan will rue the dropped catches - it was a pitiful display which saw bonus chances given to Bates, Kerr, Sophie Devine and Brooke Halliday. None of them capitalised enough to really rub salt into the wound, but just enough to ensure that Pakistan had to go hard early in their chase and maintain it, which proved way beyond their capabilities. Opener Muneeba Ali struck two early boundaries in her 15 before she was bowled by Lea Tahuhu, who also brilliantly ran out number three Iram Javed from short third. The powerful Aliya Riaz was promoted to open but the experiment did not pay off as she fell for a duck, as did Sidra Ameen, while captain Fatima Sana's 21 from 23 balls was the only contribution of note as the middle to lower order was skittled by the wily spin of Kerr and Carson. And while there were wild screams of delight and hugs of joy between the New Zealand players at the end, there will be a thorough examination for India, who would have been watching anxiously, but ultimately in despair. They launched a huge franchise tournament, the Women's Premier League, in early 2023 to catch up with Australia and while it has seen the emergence of some young talent including spinner Shreyanka Patil and seamer Arundhati Reddy, this is a disappointing tournament from the 2020 finalists. They thrashed Sri Lanka and Pakistan, fought admirably against Australia but it was the opening defeat by New Zealand that left them with an uphill climb, one which proved too steep.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'Poor' drop from Pakistan's Nashra Sandhu as New Zealand's Suzie Bates survives\n\nNew Zealand captain Sophie Devine: \"It hasn't sunk in yet.

I want them to lap up the experience. It is an awesome opportunity for them and a huge part of their career. These are the reasons you play cricket.\" Pakistan captain Fatima Sana: \"We were good in the bowling but we need to improve our fielding and batting because we were not up to the mark. We need to improve or we can't survive at this level.\" England bowler Tash Farrant on BBC Test Match Special: \u201cNew Zealand's youngsters have come to the party in this tournament - like Eden Carson who bowled really well. They've not just relied on their senior players this time. \u201cThey've had a really tough time after the last World Cup in South Africa.

    "Why weight-loss drugs may be no obesity silver bullet\n\nSir Keir Starmer and his health secretary have been lauding the potential of the new generation of weight-loss drugs. Given as regular injections, the treatments \u2013 Wegovy and Mounjaro \u2013 mimic a hormone that makes people less hungry. Not only could they help reduce waistlines, the prime minister and Wes Streeting said, they could also hold the key to a thriving economy. Sir Keir told the BBC it was time to \u201cthink differently\u201d. He was speaking after it was announced a trial would be run by Health Innovation Manchester, a research group linked to the NHS, and drug firm Eli Lilly to see if the weight loss drug Mounjaro could help get obese people back into work. Obesity is, without doubt, a major burden on the health service and wider economy. Obesity-related illness costs the NHS an estimated \u00a311bn a year \u2013 about 8% of its spending. Add in lost productivity, and research has shown it costs the economy nearly \u00a3100bn a year, external \u2013 or 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of all the economic activity in the country.\n\nSo it is understandable there is huge hope these drugs could be the answer. After all, the search for a solution to expanding waistlines has eluded successive governments since the early 1990s. Promoting healthy lifestyles, improving food labelling, restricting advertising and taking steps to increase the cost of unhealthy foods, such as the sugar tax, have all been tried - but rates of obesity have continued to rise and one in four adults is now obese. Critics say governments have not gone far enough with these initiatives, while pointing out public health spending has been squeezed in the past decade, hampering the ability of healthy lifestyle programmes to have an impact. And despite the undoubted benefits the weight-loss drugs demonstrate, health experts have warned they should not be seen as a quick fix.\n\nFirst, the NHS has tightly restricted their use for weight loss - versions of the drugs are also for diabetes. Wegovy, the brand name for semaglutide, is only available as a weight-loss drug for people who are severely obese and living with other health conditions. And it is only allowed to be given under the supervision of specialist weight loss programmes, access to which is like many NHS services constrained. Mounjaro, meanwhile, is not yet being used by the NHS as a weight-loss treatment - although, the official drugs-advisory body has proposed it should be. The criteria look likely to be similar, with the exception it may be made available more widely in the community, without the need for specialist supervision. And how that can be achieved remains to be seen - as patients still need to follow a structured programme of diet and exercise alongside the treatment. GPs are worried they do not have the capacity to oversee this - and so a range of options are still being explored. And the NHS has warned it could take years for Mounjaro to be rolled out. There is also concern the drugs could encourage a \"dependency culture\", where people do not bother with healthy eating and exercise - something Streeting himself has acknowledged.\n\nSecond, even if the NHS was to expand access, it is not clear drug manufacturers could keep up. Shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic, the version of semaglutide used for diabetes, have been reported by NHS clinics, thought partly due to a boom in demand on the private market, driven by celebrities endorsing their use as the \"skinny jab\". Although Novo Nordisk, which makes the drugs, said there should be plentiful supply of Wegovy as it has established a protected supply for the NHS. And then in terms of the rising numbers of people out of work because of illness, the role of obesity is complex to work out. The numbers not working because of ill health have risen since the pandemic, hitting 2.8 million last year. But data from the Office for National Statistics shows the most common primary factors are mental health problems and musculoskeletal conditions, affecting the joints, bones and muscles. Many will also have weight problems - but tackling that may be only one part of the answer to them returning to work.",

In a post on X, explore.org, the nature network that runs the contest, said 128 Grazer was \"the first working mom to ever be crowned champion\".\n\nIn July, two of Grazer's cubs were swept over a waterfall, where Chunk - the most dominant bear on the river - attacked them both, according to explore.org.

The officer, referred to as HA10 to protect her anonymity, said it had been an \u201cincredibly frightening\u201d event that culminated in the death of the 24-year-old in London, on 5 September 2022. That night, Met Police officer Martyn Blake shot Mr Kaba through the windscreen of an Audi car which had been linked to a shotgun incident the night before. HA10 was giving evidence for the defence in the trial of Mr Blake, 40, who denies Mr Kaba\u2019s murder.\n\nThe court heard HA10 was in a convoy of armed police vehicles that had followed the Audi to Streatham, south London, where a decision was made to initiate an enforced stop and extraction. Giving evidence, HA10 told jurors she immediately got out of her vehicle and crossed the road behind an unmarked police vehicle which was rammed by the Audi in front. HA10 told the court: \u201cIt became apparent the Audi was ramming and smashing into the vehicle ahead of it and the police vehicle behind it.\" Asked what she thought the danger was, she said: \u201cI realised in a matter of milliseconds what was happening and I was aware I had to make decisions on what my next step would be, otherwise I was putting myself in danger, potentially being hit by a vehicle.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere was an awful lot of crashing and smashing as you would expect of a collision. \u201cThere was an incredibly clear scream. It was a standout memory without having to watch the body-worn video back. \u201cI absolutely thought that one of my colleagues had been possibly hit by the vehicle.\" Cross-examining, prosecution barrister Louise Oakley said: \u201cDo you accept you were never at risk yourself of being struck by that Audi?\u201d HA10 agreed and also acknowledged there was no scream, saying: \u201cI have been advised the noise has been attributed to a noise of a tyre screeching.\u201d\n\nOn the moment Mr Kaba was fatally injured, she said: \u201cI remember a very clear and distinctive gun shot which was recognisable over and above all the other noise occurring at the time.\u201d The officer told jurors she gave \u201chands-on\u201d first aid to Mr Kaba, who died later that night from the gunshot to the head. Patrick Gibbs KC, defending, asked what the witness thought about the risk on the night. She replied: \u201cAt the time, I was very concerned I was going to be hit by the Audi.\" The officer added: \"It was an incredibly frightening, chaotic experience.\u201d\n\nHA10 told jurors she knew Mr Blake as part of the team but that he was not her direct line manager. Asked to describe him, she said: \u201cI cannot confess to knowing him very well but any interaction I had with him he was entirely friendly, very calm, very knowledgeable, very pleasant to be around.\u201d The witness added she never saw him angry, frustrated or annoyed, the court heard.\n\u2022 None Listen to In Court: Chris Kaba Killing - Police Officer on Trial twice weekly on BBC Sounds",
    "A previously unseen photo of Prince William and his mother, Princess Diana, at The Passage charity in 1993\n\nThe Prince of Wales says \u201cinspiration and guidance\u201d from his mother, Diana, has been a driving force behind his personal commitment to tackle homelessness. In a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child - and how it helped him see \u201coutside the palace walls\u201d. The prince admits he sometimes feels guilty about not being able to do more - and wants to share with his own children a sense of empathy for those facing hardship. \u201cWhen I was very small, my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run,\u201d says the prince.\n\nThe prince is keen to use his platform for \"delivering change\" on issues such as homelessness\n\nIf passion projects reveal something about what drives someone, then perhaps his support for The Passage, external charity is key to unlocking Prince William\u2019s character. The Westminster-based charity provides assistance and friendship for London\u2019s homeless and helps them into secure accommodation. Forged by childhood memories of visits with his mother, the prince's longtime support for the charity has provided the foundation for his current Homewards, external project, set up to tackle homelessness across the UK. \u201cMy mother took me to The Passage. She took Harry and I both there. I must have been about 11, I think, probably, at the time. Maybe 10. I\u2019d never been to anything like that before. And I was a bit anxious as to what to expect,\u201d he says in the ITV documentary, Prince William: We Can End Homelessness. \u201cMy mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone. \"I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone\u2019s not got a home, they\u2019re all going to be really sad. \u201cBut it was incredible how happy an environment it was,\u201d recalls Prince William. The Passage has revealed four previously unseen photos of the prince visiting their London base with his mother, the princess, in June and December 1993.\n\nWilliam recalls playing chess at the charity - and his surprise at the unexpected happiness he witnessed there\n\n\u201cI remember having some good conversations - just playing chess and chatting,\" says the prince, of his childhood visits to The Passage. \"That\u2019s when it dawned on me that there are other people out there who don\u2019t have the same life as you do.\" Prince William became the charity's official patron in 2019, but those visits have continued both publicly and privately throughout his life, often for hours longer than scheduled. In the ITV documentary, the prince is filmed serving food and clearing up at The Passage\u2019s Christmas dinner, hugging some of the regular visitors there. He is even seen being bossed around by the charity\u2019s head chef, Claudette Dawkins, as she organises her royal helper. He speaks about his concern for some of the homeless he encounters \"who are in really bad place... It's like you want to just protect them\". Over the years, the prince says he has spent a lot of time gathering information about homelessness - now he wants to do something practical to prevent it.\n\nA photo, shared by The Passage, from 1993 shows Princess Diana and Prince William at the charity in December, just before Christmas\n\nThe prince addresses the question of his own privileged status - and argues that the point of having such a big public platform is to put it to good use, by taking action on issues such as reducing homelessness. \u201cI feel, with my position and my platform, I should be delivering change,\u201d he says. \u201cI've spent enough time learning and listening to what people have been through that I feel almost guilty every time I leave that I'm not doing more to help. \u201cI feel compelled to act, because I don't want to just talk about it. I don't want to just listen. I actually want to see someone smile because their life has been made better,\" says the prince. \u201cBuilding a project is the only way I can see, at the moment, to try and alleviate [the problem], and help people who are in a much less fortunate, or in a very difficult, situation.\u201d Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, says of Prince William's visits: \"I think he feels most at home when he's just chatting away with our clients and hearing their stories. \"People can get very nervous, but he\u2019s very good at putting people at ease.\"\n\nPrince William's Homewards project, which has six flagship locations across the UK, aims to show homelessness is not inevitable. \"The ultimate ambition is to prove that we can prevent homelessness in these regions, so then others will come along and go, well, if they can do it, why can\u2019t we?\" says the prince. It draws on the experience of Finland, where homelessness was effectively reduced by a policy of providing secure accommodation for people, with wrap-around support for contributory issues such as mental health problems and addiction. Among those William speaks to over the course of the film is Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, who went from being a rough sleeper to becoming a chief fire officer. She has used her own lived experience to advise the prince's current project.\n\nAnother picture shared by The Passage shows an 11-year-old Prince William sitting alongside his mother\n\nLord John Bird, the forthright founder of the Big Issue, has warned of decades of failed initiatives to tackle homelessness, but has nonetheless backed the prince's intervention. \"I am very impressed that a young man who has got young children and could go and live the life of Riley, has decided to make a stand for the work that he wants to do, and the work that his mother did. \"Princess Diana was probably the only personality who shone a light on homelessness. \"What she was saying is, these are human beings and I\u2019m going to address myself to it. And I think that her son, William, has said, this is the legacy.\" Prince William: We Can End Homelessness, ITV1, 30 and 31 October, 21.00.",
    "It has been 10 days since Mozambicans went to the polls\n\nThe lawyer for a prominent Mozambique opposition figure has been shot dead in the capital, Maputo, along with an official from his party. Elvino Dias was the attorney for Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, who ran for president in an election 10 days ago, as an independent candidate with support from the political party Podemos. Dias died with Podemos official Paulo Guambe when gunmen attacked their car. \"They were brutally assassinated [in a] cold-blooded murder,\" said local rights group the Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD).\n\n\"The indications [are] that around 10 to 15 bullets were shot, and they died instantly,\" said the group's director, Adriano Nuvunga. Another organisation, the Mais Integridade election watchdog, said the killings were designed to intimidate anyone demanding transparency in the polls. One of the victims, Dias, died instantly, but witnesses say the other, Guambe, succumbed to his injuries hours later, and allege that police blocked his evacuation by an ambulance that had arrived at the scene to assist them. Witnesses also allege that the police engaged in censorship and intimidation, preventing them from recording the violent scene, confiscating and damaging several phones. The police have denied any wrongdoing, and say they will take all necessary measures to prevent any acts of vandalism, violence, or public disorder in coming days. \"Naturally, we condemn the heinous crime and assure that we are taking all measures to clarify the case,\" police spokesman Lionel Muchina said on Saturday. Tributes have been paid to Dias, described by the Carta de Mo\u00e7ambique news site as a \"shrewd lawyer, intrepid, with the tough fibre of a fighter\". \"Elvino was a good, peaceful man,\" said Zenaido Machado, of Human Rights Watch. \"Last year, during local elections, he led several elections court cases against the election commission, and he won. This year, he was preparing to do it again.\" Election votes are still being counted in Mozambique. Mondlane says he has won, and disputes claims by the establishment Frelimo party that they are in the lead. He has called for a nationwide strike on Monday. The European Union, whose observer mission is in Mozambique monitoring the electoral process, called the killings an outrageous crime and urged the government to conduct an independent investigation. The European bloc said these events followed \"worrying reports about violent dispersion of supporters in the aftermath of last week's election\". Western observers have cast doubt on the credibility of the election. Vote-buying, inflated voter rolls in Frelimo strongholds, and voter intimidation have been reported by the US-based International Republican Institute, which sent a multinational election observer mission to Mozambique. Mozambique has only ever been governed by one party - Frelimo - which has ruled the southern African nation for half a century since independence from Portugal. The country is guaranteed a new president because President Filipe Nyusi is stepping down after serving the two-term limit. His successor, the leader of Frelimo, is 47-year-old Daniel Chapo. His rivals in this election are Mondlane who has the backing of Podemos, Ossufo Momade, the former rebel commander-turned-leader of the main opposition party Renamo, and Lutero Simango from the Mozambique Democratic Movement. A civil war between the Frelimo government, with support from Cuba and the USSR, and the anti-communist Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) rebels took place from 1977 to 1992. The conflict resulted in more than a million people dying in the fighting and in subsequent famines. Renamo remains Mozambique's largest opposition party, and was the springboard for Mondlane's political career before he defected to the newly formed Podemos earlier this year. Mozambique is rich in natural resources including rubies and gas, but is also struggling with an Islamist insurgency in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, where soldiers from dozens of countries have been deployed to help.\n\nVen\u00e2ncio Mondlane of the Podemos party is running for president",
    "Jonathan Edge took cash-in-hand payments for the devices he prepared at home\n\nA man who sold Firestick devices he reconfigured to allow people to illegally stream Premier League football matches and ignored warnings to stop has been jailed. Jonathan Edge, from Liverpool, uploaded the unauthorised services onto the Amazon products at home and then sold them for them cash after advertising on Facebook. The 29-year-old pleaded guilty to three fraud offences after a private prosecution by the Premier League and was jailed for three years and four months at Liverpool Crown Court. Kevin Plumb, representing the league, said efforts to protect broadcast rights would continue by cracking down on illegal operators \u201cno matter the scale\u201d.\n\nEdge was also sentenced for accessing and viewing the illicit football streams he was selling on. The court heard he ran the operation for cash-in-hand payments and continued despite warnings by the Premier League to stop.\n\n\u201cMany people see no harm in illegally streaming TV services but they are wrong,\" Det Sgt Steve Frame, from Merseyside Police, said. He said Edge's sentence should \"serve as a further warning how seriously such copyright theft continues to be taken\". Mr Plumb said the selling of Premier League broadcast rights helped support \"financial contributions to the whole football pyramid\". \"We\u2019re pleased that the courts have once again recognised the importance of safeguarding these rights,\" he added. Keiron Sharp, of the intellectual property rights watchdog FACT, said those who create an illegal business to sell stolen content will be investigated, \"regardless of their level of operation or advertising methods\". In a statement, the Premier League added: \"Edge ignored multiple warnings to stop this activity, which was referenced by the judge and treated as an aggravating factor towards the sentence passed. \"The judge also recognised that legitimate subscribers are victims of these fraudulent operations and therefore their impact goes beyond that experienced by the broadcast industry.\"",

    "Pollution has been worsening in recent days\n\nAir pollution in India's capital Delhi has soared to extremely severe levels, choking residents and engulfing the city in thick smog. Monitors recorded pollution levels of 1,500 on the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 15:00 IST (09:30 BST), according to tech company IQAir - 15 times the level the World Health Organization (WHO) considers satisfactory for breathing. The toxic air has disrupted flight services, and had already prompted authorities to shut schools and ban construction work in the city. It comes just weeks after Lahore, in neighbouring Pakistan, also recorded pollution levels above 1,000.\n\nAnd experts warn that the situation could get worse in Delhi in the coming days, saying more severe measures may be needed to combat the city's pollution problem. According to the WHO, air with AQI values above 300 are considered to be hazardous for health. India's pollution control authority has classified the air in Delhi as \"severe plus\", after the city passed 450 according to its measurements on Monday morning. As well as shutting schools and banning construction work, the city has also banned the entry of non-essential trucks into Delhi and has asked all offices to ask 50% of their staff to work from home. Last week, the government banned all activities that involve the use of coal and firewood, as well as diesel generator use for non-emergency services.\n\nEvery year, Delhi, India's northern states and parts of Pakistan battle hazardous air during the winter months of October to January due to plummeting temperatures, smoke, dust, low wind speed, vehicular emissions and crop stubble burning. And every year, the government imposes pollution control measures during these months. Yet, Delhi's pollution problem hasn't gone away. On Monday, Delhi's Chief Minister Atishi said that all of northern India was experiencing a \"medical emergency\" due to stubble burning continuing unchecked across the country, particularly in the neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. She accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of not taking steps to curb the practice despite the problem intensifying over the past five years. The BJP, in turn, has blamed Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for not being able to put a check to pollution in the city. Meanwhile, Delhi's residents continue to gasp for air. \"Woke up with a itchy, painful throat.. even two air purifiers are not making the AQI breathable indoors. Children are breathing in gas chamber,\" one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Another user called for a \"peaceful mass protest on the streets\". \"The air we breathe is lethally toxic,\" he wrote.\n\nDelhi is enveloped in a thick blanket of smog on most mornings",
    "One of the sexual offences Hugh Nelson admitted was intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of the rape of a child under the age of 13\n\nA graphic design student used artificial intelligence to create child abuse images that he then sold to other paedophiles. Hugh Nelson, 27, from Bolton, accepted requests in online chatrooms for \"bespoke\" explicit computer-generated images depicting children being harmed. The ex-student with a Masters in graphics, who admitted 11 offences, also used images of real children for some AI \"artwork\", Bolton Crown Court heard. Judge Martin Walsh said the case, which police have called \"a landmark\" prosecution, was \"difficult and troubling\" and he would sentence Nelson on Monday as he needed to reflect carefully on it.\n\nNelson frequently discussed child sexual abuse with other chatroom users and on three separate occasions encouraged the rape of children aged under 13, the court heard. David Toal, prosecuting, said the case resulted from Operation Influence, an investigation into the \"creation and developing trends of AI in relation to child sexual exploitation\". He added: \"The use of AI is rapidly improving and the imagery is becoming more realistic.\"\n\nThe defendant was unmasked as the administrator of a paedophile chatroom when he engaged in a conversation with an undercover officer in May last year, said Mr Toal. Nelson told the officer he took commissions from customers for images created by 3D modelling software and went on to send computer-generated images which depicted child sexual abuse.\n\nMr Toal said: \"The defendant said he had over 60 characters in total, ranging from six months to middle-aged, and he charged \u00a380 to create a new character. Nelson, who had no previous convictions, was arrested at his family home in Egerton in June last year and told police he had a sexual interest mainly in girls aged about 12. He said he had met like-minded people on the internet and eventually began to create images for sale as he considered his offending \"had got out of control\", the court heard. Various devices were seized and were found to contain a large quantity of indecent images as well as chats online with adults in France, Italy and the United States regarding the sexual exploitation and rape of children, although there was no evidence before the court to say any child had been sexually or physically assaulted.\n\nBob Elias, defending, said Nelson was a \"shy, gauche man\" who led a \"lonely, socially isolated existence\" in his bedroom at his family home. He said: \"What he was seeking primarily was validation, congratulations and a sense of belonging in a community. \"He was earning relatively small amounts of money and desperately wanted validation. \"He has brought his life crashing down around him to the shock and horror of his immediate family.\" Nelson had recognised the depravity of his actions and had apologised for them in a letter to the judge, the court heard. The defendant pleaded guilty in August to various sexual offences including intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of the rape of a child under the age of 13, making and distributing indecent images of children, and attempting to incite a child aged under 16 to engage in sexual activity.",
    "A serving police office in South West England has been arrested on suspicion of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The officer, a constable aged in his thirties, was arrested on Tuesday in Gloucestershire by counterterrorism police, who said the suspected support \"relates to activity online\". He has been taken to a police custody unit outside Gloucestershire. Specialist officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) made the arrest on a property in Gloucester, and also searched a vehicle and address in the area, police said.\n\nGloucestershire Police Assistant Chief Constable Arman Mathieson said the searches aimed to find digital devices for analysis. \u201cThe arrest of a serving officer on suspicion of such a serious offence will no doubt cause our communities concern, as it does everyone who works for Gloucestershire Police,\" he added. \u201cThe arrest has been made to allow for a prompt and effective investigation to take place and we must not draw any conclusions at this stage.\u201d It's an offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act to provide support for a proscribed terrorist group. Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah, more commonly known as Hamas, has ruled Gaza since 2007. It was proscribed in its entirety in the UK in 2021. The group was responsible for the 7 October 2023 attacks, which saw hundreds of gunmen enter southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel retaliated by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A week after the 7 October attacks, the government's independent reviewer of terrorism warned speeches at pro-Palestinian rallies in the UK might have glorified terrorism. \"People need to know, if you glorify that you risk committing a really serious terrorism offence,\" Jonathan Hall KC said at the time. Then-home secretary Suella Braverman also said \"the full force of the law\" should be used against support for Hamas. Members of the Conservative government urged the Metropolitan Police to increase patrols, claiming people were \"glorifying the terrorist activities of Hamas\". In April this year, a man was found guilty of wearing a headband in support of Hamas at a pro-Palestinian rally in central London.",

    "'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family\u2019s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent\n\nSha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza\n\nWarning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act. This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October. In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son. The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: \u201cDon\u2019t be worried, I am OK dad\u2026 I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him. \u201cThree times I tried to pull him [Abdulrahman] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.\u201d His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire. Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza\u2019s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family\u2019s tent were shared around the world on social media. There are burns all over Ahmed\u2019s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: \u201cThey broke my heart, and they broke my spirit\u2026 I wish the fire had burned me.\u201d The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday). The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas \"command and control\" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.\n\nAhmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family\n\nFour people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was \u201creviewing the incident\u201d. A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians. \u201cIsrael has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.\u201d The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.\n\nPalestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people\n\nPeople are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war. Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras. But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help. In the days following his death Sha'aban\u2019s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life. The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same. \u201cWe saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood\u2026 All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.\u201d We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.\n\nIn a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers. \u201cWe live in very hard circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.\u201d In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza. The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother. But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings. \u201cI was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain\u2026 My brother\u2019s leg was trapped and he couldn\u2019t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand. \"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.\u201d Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: \u201cI\u2019ll work for you.\u201d\n\nMohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire\n\nMohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made. \u201cWe managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink\u2026 then everything was lost.\u201d He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet. \u201cWithout it, I wouldn\u2019t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.\u201d This is his only memento of the woman who was \u201cthe kindness in our home\". The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die. \u201cI can\u2019t describe it. I can\u2019t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.\u201d Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: \u201cWhat more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.\u201d",

Here under low, grey autumn skies the six remaining representatives of that huge and heroic moment, the men who were actually there, went quietly past in wheelchairs, with a collective age of 595 years.\n\nIt included 101-year-old Joe Randall, who was aged 20 at D-Day, and who had helped build temporary airfields for the invasion force liberating Europe from Nazism. There\u2019s an immense poignancy to such moments, literally watching history moving out of sight.\n\nWith a military band playing marches, the Spirit of Normandy group were brought past the Cenotaph, part of a long stream of veterans paying their homage, each bringing their own memories as they laid their wreaths. Like a marathon runner determined to cross the line, the very last veteran in the march-past had got out of a wheelchair and was helped on to a walking frame, so he could walk upright past the Cenotaph. It was a slow, stubborn defiance of the passing years, paying his respects his own way, when all the other groups had finished, cheered on by the crowds nearby on the pavement. The youngest contingent was also an emotional moment, in a different way from the ranks of grey-haired ex-military marchers. There were children and young people, from nine years old and upwards, who had lost a parent in the armed forces, brought together by the Scotty\u2019s Little Soldiers charity. All those years of missing a loved one still to come.\n\nBereaved children of armed forces personnel also took part in the march past\n\nThere\u2019s an irresistible sense of the importance of time at such events. Big Ben tolling out across Whitehall. The eleventh hour, the two-minute silence. The band keeping time, the marchers keeping step. The autumn leaves on a Whitehall empty of traffic. For a few moments people even did the unthinkable - putting down their mobile phones. Leading events was King Charles and what was he thinking about his own past year? He has carried on working despite suffering from cancer. On his 76th birthday this week he will be out supporting food banks. As he stared solemnly straight ahead at the Cenotaph, was this his own commitment to public service, duty and endurance? Catherine, the Princess of Wales, was looking down from the Foreign Office balcony, recovering from her own year of health problems. Much has changed since she stood there last year.\n\nThe Princess of Wales watched on from the balcony of the Foreign Office\n\nIt's been a different kind of upheaval this year for the politicians present. Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch were laying wreaths for the first time as prime minister and leader of the opposition. It was a day to remember previous wars, but the new ministers must have been thinking too of the conflicts raging today and wondering about where they could lead. Behind where Sir Keir was standing, a Ukrainian flag was hanging limply over the Foreign Office building, without any wind to make it fly. For all of those present, the royals, the veterans, the political leaders, the crowds, the focal point for Remembrance is the Cenotaph, the memorial standing in the middle of Whitehall.\n\nIt becomes a kind of altar as well as a monument, as Whitehall temporarily becomes a mixture of a church, military parade ground and national shrine. Part of the Cenotaph's power is its plainness. There's almost no ornamentation or religious imagery. That might help it fit in with a modern, eclectic, multi-faith world, with representatives of more than 20 different religions and beliefs gathered around it. The Cenotaph as we see it now is a permanent structure made from Portland stone, but it began as a temporary, wooden structure. There were people who thought it shouldn't be on Whitehall, as it might get in the way. And perhaps that's its point. It's there to get in the way, a sometimes awkward reminder, to make people remember if they were ever tempted to forget.",

    "How Gary Lineker went from football sensation to BBC star\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: 'Any good?' Lineker kicks off 25 years as MOTD host\n\nGary Lineker, who will leave Match of the Day at the end of this season, BBC News understands, has been the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies. As host of the flagship show for 25 years, he is also one of the corporation's highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million last year. His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless. But they were the result of years of honing his craft and presenting skills.\n\nGary Lineker celebrated qualifying for Euro 92 after the match between Poland and England in 1991\n\nAs a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career. His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.\n\nEven while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.\n\u2022 None Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team. \"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014. \"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\" His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit. But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".\n\nLineker won the Golden Boot, for leading goal scorer, at Mexico's 1986 World Cup\n\nHis early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told the BBC's Media Show's Ros Atkins in 2021. Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\", he said. \"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\" Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts, external and carving out a role for himself. Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker presenting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football. \u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019. \"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\" Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final. Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.\n\nDavid Gower, Nick Hancock, Rory McGrath and Gary Lineker on They Think It's All Over in 2002\n\nHe also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003. As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997. By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit. This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam. \"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said. \"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing. \"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"\n\nLineker said Des Lynam was \"the doyen of sports presenters and a tough act to follow\"\n\nBy 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain. People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen. Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own. He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did. Their friendships often shone through. In June this year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.\n\nClimbing to the top: Lineker tries out a climbing wall\n\nBut despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward. As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny. Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality. In March last year, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him. Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence. Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue. BBC director general Tim Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation. Lineker was reinstated nine days later. The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\". \"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.\n\nGary Lineker and Alan Shearer have fronted many major football tourments\n\nThe headlines and dramas generated by his online views reinforced not only his high celebrity status - but also how keen the BBC was to hang on to him. The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning. Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\". By February this year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk. Despite this, he and the BBC are still parting company, and its flagship football show no longer has a host. Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger. It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at this year's Podcast Awards. But for the BBC, Lineker's departure comes hot on the heels of several scandals. Former Match of the Day and The One Show host Jermaine Jenas was sacked in August following complaints about workplace conduct. In September, the BBC apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, while clearing him of the most serious allegations. In the same month, Mr Davie said he could not see disgraced ex-news presenter Huw Edwards working at the corporation again. Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children. So the BBC is in need of some good headlines - and Lineker's departure means it now has to find an exceptional host to fill his shoes, which will not be an easy task.",
    "Google introduces new way to search by filming video\n\nGoogle has released a new feature which will allow people to search the internet by taking a video. Video search will let people point their camera at something, ask a question about it, and get search results. Android and iPhone users globally will gain access to the feature from 1700 GMT by enabling \"AI Overviews\" in their Google app, but it will only support English at launch. It is the latest move from the tech giant to change how people search online by utilising artificial intelligence (AI). It comes three months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announced it was trialling the ability to search by asking its chatbot questions. Google introduced AI-generated results at the top of certain search queries this year, with mixed results. In May, the feature drew criticism for providing erratic, inaccurate answers, which included advising people to make cheese stick to pizza by using \"non-toxic glue\". At the time, a Google spokesperson said the issues were \"isolated examples\". The results have since become better, with fewer inaccuracies. Since then, there have been further moves to include AI in search, which included the ability to ask questions about still images using Google Lens. The firm said this feature has increased the popularity of Lens, within its mobile app, which has motivated it to expand the feature further.\n\nGoogle's head of search Liz Reid said the new capability would let people ask questions about the world around them more easily. She gave the example of a person at an aquarium, who might want to find out why a group of fish are swimming in unison. Instead of having to search for the fish online and write out the query, the new feature will let them point their camera, record a short clip and ask a question out loud. Google's AI will analyse the video, identify the fish, combine that with the question and produce search results. Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said this was a \"big thing\" for Google. \"We are now seeing AI in everything and people connect best with visuals,\" he said. \"This latest development further demonstrates new ways of bringing content to life with something like search which is one of the most common tasks carried out on the internet. \"Here lies scope for AI to be truly collaborative and an innovator in everyday life - we are on the brink of AI becoming personalised and unique based upon our usage patterns and habits.\"\n\nAs well as introducing a way to search by video, Google has also released several other updates. It says it has improved its shopping results, which will now incorporate reviews and pricing information from different sellers. And it is also introducing a competitor to the music-identifying app Shazam, which is owned by Apple. The rival tool, accessible through Circle to Search on an Android device, will let people identify songs from a website they're on or a show they're streaming without leaving the app. Google's new features come as it faces growing challengers in the search space, where it is estimated to have cornered more than 90% of the market globally. This includes OpenAI, which revealed in July it was trialling a search feature within ChatGPT. SearchGPT lets people search the internet by asking questions to a chatbot, and it is being tested by a limited number of users in the US. OpenAI's value surged to $157bn (\u00a3120bn) on Wednesday after it raised $6.6bn in its latest funding round from high-profile investors including Microsoft. Google's new announcements are likely a way to combat the growth of rival firms - though none are yet to truly threaten its massive dominance.",
    "Brazil first lady uses expletive against Elon Musk at G20 event\n\nBrazil's first lady has sworn at billionaire Elon Musk at an event ahead of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro. While advocating for tougher social media regulation on a panel about disinformation, Janja Lula da Silva appeared to be startled by a loud noise, joking, \"I think it's Elon Musk.\" \"I'm not afraid of you,\" she went on to say, then swore at the billionaire, who owns Tesla and social media platform X. Musk, who was picked to lead the Department of Government Efficiency in incoming US President Donald Trump's administration, has a complicated relationship with Brazil and its left-wing government. X was briefly banned there this year. He reposted a video of the incident, captioned \"lol\".\n\nIn another post, Musk added two laughing emojis and wrote: \"They are going to lose the next election\", apparently referring to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's Workers Party. Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban on X, after it failed to name a legal representative in the country and suspend accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation. The ban was lifted after the platform paid a $5.1m (\u00a33.8m) fine more than a month later. But Musk is also an ally of Brazil's former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who was found guilty of discrediting the electoral system after losing in 2022. Despite the eight-year ban stopping him from running in an election, he has declared his intent to run again in the next elections, to be held in 2026. Bolsonaro, who reposted a screenshot of the video and Musk's response, said, \"We now have another diplomatic problem.\" Leaders of the G20 nations will be meeting for the summit, which starts on Monday.",
    "Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu is trying to sway US election\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'I don't know - Biden on whether Netanyahu is attempting to sway election\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said he is unsure whether Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal in order to influence next month's US election. He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: \"Whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know - but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: \u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,\" he said. \"And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that.\" Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November.\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel\u2019s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s actions, as connected to the American election.\" Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel\u2019s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November. Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close. A deal before the election would be a major boost for the president and the Democratic Party but appears increasingly unlikely.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has mostly criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has rejected suggestions from Washington that an agreement is close. \"Hamas is not there with a deal. There\u2019s not a deal in the making, unfortunately,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said earlier this month just hours after a US official said it was 90% complete. The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. It has also vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack this week. At his appearance at Friday's press briefing, which came as a shock to reporters in the room as it was his first since becoming president four years ago, Biden responded to concern that Israel could strike Iranian oil fields in retaliation. \"The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike,\" he said. \"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.\" Biden caused oil prices to rise on Thursday when he said the US was discussing with Israel the possibility of strikes on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure.",

    "US actor Ron Ely, best known for playing the role of Tarzan in the 1960s television show of the same name, has died aged 86. \"The world has lost one of the greatest men it has ever known - and I have lost my dad,\" the actor's daughter, Kirsten Casale Ely, said in an Instagram post. Tarzan originally aired on NBC television network from 1966 to 1968, during which time the actor broke a number of bones and was reported to have been attacked by animals while performing his own stunts. After retiring from acting in 2001, Ely became an author and published two mystery novels.\n\nEly made a brief return to acting for one television film, Expecting Amish, in 2014, where he played an Amish elder. In the 1980s, he appeared in other hit television programmes including cruise ship-based comedy The Love Boat, as well as Wonder Woman with star Lynda Carter. Born in Texas in 1938, Ely went on to marry his high school sweetheart in 1959, before divorcing two years later. He was also known for hosting the Miss America pageant in the early 1980s, where he met his second wife Valerie Lundeen. The couple went on to have three children. Lundeen was stabbed to death aged 62 by their son, Cameron, at their California home in 2019. He was then shot dead by police after being deemed a threat by attending officers. Ron Ely filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the force, though the judge ruled the officers had acted in self-defence.

Mr Salmond\u2019s political influence extended within and, yes, beyond Scotland, for no one in the last half century has come as close as he did to remoulding, resetting the boundaries and borders of these islands, to redrawing the map of the UK. For all the arguments of our politics, there is perhaps none more fundamental than where the frontiers of the state lie, and Mr Salmond personified a movement that came closer to shifting them than any other in the modern era.\n\nA lifelong personal zeal for Scottish independence energised his mission to shift his cause from a sidebar to the mainstream, and to within a whisker of it actually happening. He never managed it \u2014 \u201cthe dream shall never die\u201d he said after defeat in the referendum in 2014. His very public fallout with his successor as first minister Nicola Sturgeon is well documented. He was also cleared of sexually assaulting a number of women after a high profile trial. His dream for Scottish independence remains unfulfilled, but its pursuit reshapes Scottish politics to this day. It is a nation, a polity recast in his time and split pretty much down the middle on its constitutional future. Mr Salmond\u2019s role in shaping that future cannot be underestimated. He was a primary colours politician \u2014 waspish, pugnacious, unrelenting, engaging \u2014 and at once complicated and undoubtedly controversial, in his politics and his personal conduct. But he was, above all, a man of consequence.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "'Rightmove is my porn' - the addiction to online property search\n\nKatie Smith will regularly go \"Rightmove stalking\" of the houses she has seen for sale\n\nKatie Smith has had an addiction for as long as she can remember. Something she feels compelled to do dozens of times a day. The 30-year-old finds herself repeatedly opening the Rightmove app, despite the fact she has no intention of moving house anytime soon. \"Rightmove is my porn,\" laughs Katie, from Stone, Staffordshire. \"It's like being a modern day peeping Tom,\" she says, referring to the number of homes she looks inside, all from the comfort of her smartphone. Last week, after a day trip to Knutsford, Cheshire, she spent the evening looking at all the houses for sale there - regardless of price. And during a recent weekend in London, she loved looking at \"how expensive houses in Richmond are\", which was close to her hotel. Property portals like Rightmove, Zoopla and On the Market are goldmines of user data about both homebuyers and sellers. Zoopla told the BBC that 1,860 properties are viewed every minute on its website and app, while the figure is even higher for Rightmove \u2013 nearly 10,000 properties viewed per minute. Rightmove recently rejected a fourth takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s REA Group, saying the latest \u00a36.2bn offer undervalued the company, external and its future prospects, showing just how valuable the data it holds is. The websites themselves acknowledge that not all their users may actually be looking to move home, so what is it that keeps people scrolling?\n\nKatie, who previously worked in interior design, says she loves to check how quickly properties might sell and has a list of favourite homes she has looked at. \"I love character properties, things with features like beautiful Georgian homes,\" she says. While she and her partner are planning to move out of her rented accommodation in about six months, there is no immediate or urgent need to search. \"He thinks I am looking at more houses because of this, but it's not - it's just because I love it!\u201d\n\nSam Kennedy Christian, who lives in Herne Bay in Kent with her husband and two children, uses Zoopla to look at her dream purchases. \"I love imagining what I'd get if we won the lottery... specifically in the Isle of Man where I grew up and my family still live,\" she says.\n\nSam Kennedy Christian uses Zoopla to look at houses both in her local market and in the area where she grew up\n\nThey moved closer to the seaside during the pandemic as many people looked for more outdoor space. Sam says she enjoys refreshing the Zoopla app as part of her \"bedtime scrolling\" routine, or while waiting for the baby to drop off to sleep. She also keeps an eye on similar properties in the local market, although they are not intending to sell anytime soon. \"I especially love a floorplan - you can get a real handle on a house, and how you might use the space.\"\n\nWhen we browse property websites, we\u2019re engaging in \u201ca form of escapism that taps into the brain\u2019s reward systems,\" says Louisa Dunbar, the founder of OrangeGrove, a research agency that uses behavioural science to improve business websites. \"Visualising ourselves in these desirable homes triggers the dopamine system, giving us a sense of pleasure, even if we\u2019re not planning to buy. It\u2019s a chance to mentally step into a better life.\u201d She says that certain features of property portals can play a big role on what we might click on. High-quality photos may encourage viewers to picture themselves living in a property, while the use of badging listings with terms like \"Highlight\" or \"Just added\" fuels the fear of missing out. These psychological triggers can keep us engaged as we nose around the neighbour's living room, or imagine a better future, she says.\n\nIdly browsing online property listings is a favourite pastime for many people\n\nUsers may love these property sites, but are they worth it to estate agents, given most online viewings will not turn into actual enquiries? Some agents have expressed unease at the high cost to advertise, particularly on Rightmove as the market leader. They say they provide all the photos and listings information about the houses for sale and are then having to pay to do it. It means these high costs can limit their ability to advertise in local newspapers or other places. One estate agent, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a case of not being able to live without the likes of Rightmove. The prices [for estate agents] are going up faster than I\u2019d like and I worry about the stranglehold they have on the market. \u201cBut, even if many users are just idly browsing without any real intention of moving, it is still worth it to have properties on there.\u201d Rightmove responded, saying it has \"a variety of different packages to suit businesses of different sizes and needs and the average [agent] spends \u00a31,497 per month\". Both Rightmove and Zoopla are bullish about the future, saying that confidence in the market is recovering as mortgage rates fall. On Thursday, Zoopla said the number of homes for sale on its platform is growing. And for now they seem to be attracting everyone whether you're an idle browser just nosing around, fantasising perhaps about castles you can never afford, a homeowner checking on how the value of your home compares with your neighbours\u2019, or even an actual genuine buyer.",
    "From Wimbledon to VAR, is tech hurting the drama of sport?\n\nLine judges will no longer feature at Wimbledon from next year\n\n\"The drama of a player shouting and making a challenge, and the crowd watching the screen and waiting for Hawk-Eye to make a decision, all of that drama is now lost.\" David Bayliss is describing a scene he saw play out many times as a Wimbledon line judge - and one which the Championships won't witness again. Just as with the many other sports that have embraced technology, the All England Club is waving goodbye to human line judges from next summer, after 147 years, in the name of \"maximum accuracy\". But does this risk minimising the drama Mr Bayliss fondly remembers being involved in - and which so many of us love watching?\n\nDavid Bayliss is pictured behind Andy Murray during a match at the Wimbledon championships in 2013\n\n\"It is sad that we won\u2019t be going back as line judges,\" he says. \"The game has moved on, but never say never.\" He served as a line judge and umpire at Wimbledon for 22 years, calling the lines when Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam, in 2003. Being hit by the ball at over 100mph is, he jokes, \"quite sore\". While he's sad to see line judges go, he says it's hard to argue with the logic. \"Essentially, we have a human being and technology calling the same line. The electronic line call can overrule the human eye. Therefore, why do we need the line judge to make a call at all?\" Of course, even before Wimbledon's announcement this week, technology played a big part at the tournament through Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking system, and organisers are following the example set by others. It was announced last year that the ATP tour would replace the human line judge with an electronic system from 2025. The US Open and the Australian Open have also scrapped them. The French Open will be the only major tournament left with human line judges.\n\nDavid Bayliss looks forward to working in other roles at Wimbledon\n\nAs the BBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human. Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a \"high degree of trust in the electronic line calling\". He points out: \"The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point.\"\n\nWhether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another. Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her \"first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness\". \"A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in,\" the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC. While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check. Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech.\n\nDr Anna Fitzpatrick, pictured here in 2011 in a qualifying match for Wimbledon, said players became friends with line judges and umpires as they would see them at a variety of tournaments\n\nCricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters. He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game. \"I think we need to be careful,\" he tells the BBC. In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated. He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not. However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening. \"The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game,\" he adds.\n\nOpta and their stats have become a key part of football coverage for many fans and broadcasters\n\nOf course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport. Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics. \"Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair. \"That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right.\" Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate the dramatic conclusion to the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics. And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data. Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating. While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love. And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping. \"People love sport because of the drama,\" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta. \"Technology is kind of making it stronger.\"",

The former MP and MSP, who led the country between 2007 and 2014, became ill while attending an international conference in North Macedonia. The North Macedonian government said Mr Salmond had lost consciousness at the Inex Olgica hotel, near the city of Ohrid, at about 15:30 local time on Saturday. Local media reports said he collapsed during a lunch and was pronounced dead at the scene. The Alba party, which he led, believe the cause of death to be a heart attack, according to the Press Association news agency.\n\nTributes have poured in from across the political spectrum, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing him as being a \"monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics\". Salmond's succcessor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said he had been her mentor and that \"for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics\". King Charles said he and the Queen were \"greatly saddened\" to hear of Salmond's sudden death, adding: \"His devotion to Scotland drove his decades of public service \"We extend our deep condolences to his family and loved ones at this time\". Salmond led the pro-independence side ahead of the referendum in 2014, and resigned as first minister after Scottish voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. He had led the SNP to power when they won the Scottish Parliament election in 2007, having previously been the party's leader between 1990 and 2000. Salmond, Scotland's first pro-independence first minister, then led the SNP to an unprecedented majority in the election four years later - which paved the way for the referendum to be held. Under his leadership, the Scottish government also introduced popular policies including free NHS prescriptions and free university tuition fees for Scottish students. After quitting as first minister, he had a spectacular fallout with Sturgeon over her government\u2019s mishandling of harassment complaints against him. Salmond was also cleared of serious sexual offence charges after a trial in Edinburgh in 2020. He had been charged with 13 offences, including attempted rape, but was acquitted of all of the charges against him after two weeks of evidence at the High Court. The women who made the allegations against Salmond - which dated back to his time as first minister - had included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. During his evidence to the court, he said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\" or \"exaggerations\". In his closing speech to the jury, Salmond's lawyer said the former first minister \"could certainly have been a better man\" but had not committed any crimes. After quitting the SNP, Salmond set up an alternative independence supporting party, called Alba, of which he was the leader. He also hosted his own show on the controversial Russian broadcaster RT, but suspended it following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nSalmond had a spectacular fall out with his former protege Nicola Sturgeon after she succeeded him as first minister\n\nAlba has approached the UK foreign office for help in returning Salmond\u2019s body to the UK. Its deputy leader Kenny MacAskill described Salmond as being \"the outstanding Scottish politician not just of his generation but for generations far before\" and said he had \"possessed extraordinary charm and a common touch which endeared him to so many in Scotland\". Paying tribute to her former political mentor, Sturgeon said she was \"shocked and sorry\" to learn of Salmond's death. She added: \"Obviously, I cannot pretend that the events of the past few years which led to the breakdown of our relationship did not happen, and it would not be right for me to try. \"However, it remains the fact that for many years Alex was an incredibly significant figure in my life. \"He was my mentor, and for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics.\" First Minister John Swinney said he was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" at the news and extended his condolences to Salmond's wife Moira and his family. Swinney added: \"Alex worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved and for her Independence. \"He took the Scottish National Party from the fringes of Scottish politics into government and led Scotland so close to becoming an independent country.\" Former First Minister Humza Yousaf said he and Salmond had \"obviously had our differences in the last few years\", but praised the \"enormous contribution he made to Scottish and UK politics\". The Scottish Parliament has lowered its flags as a mark of respect to Salmond.\n\nAlex Salmond had been married to his wife Moira since 1981\n\nSalmond was born on Hogmanay 1954 in Linlithgow and went on to study economic and medieval history at the University of St Andrews, where he joined the SNP almost immediately after arriving in 1973. He later worked as an assistant economist for the UK government's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland before moving on to the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked for seven years as an economist, eventually coming to specialise in oil and gas. He served as the SNP MP for Banff and Buchan between 1987 and 2010 and was elected as party leader in 1990. Salmond was elected to the Scottish Parliament when it was created in 1999, but stood down as party leader a year later before returning as leader in 2004.\n\nSir Keir Starmer described Salmond as being a \"monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics\". The prime minister added: \"As first minister of Scotland he cared deeply about Scotland's heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented as MP and MSP over many years of service. \"My thoughts are with those who knew him, his family and his loved ones. On behalf of the UK government, I offer them our condolences today.\" Starmer's predecessor as prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: \"Alex Salmond was a huge figure in our politics. \"While I disagreed with him on the constitutional question, there was no denying his skill in debate or his passion for politics. May he rest in peace.\"",

The tractor was driven through Tenbury Wells during floods at the weekend\n\nA man has been arrested after a tractor driver was seen driving through deep floodwaters in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, which led to damage to shops. The town centre was flooded on Sunday after a wall collapsed by Kyre Brook. In a video shared on social media, a wave from the tractor was seen striking shops and homes overlooking the street, breaking some windows. A 57-year-old was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving and released on bail while inquiries continue, police said.\n\nGreetings card shop proprietors Garry and Sarah Thomas said they were worried about how long it would take businesses to recover from the flood\n\nInsp Dave Wise, of West Mercia Police, said: \"I'd like to thank everyone who brought this incident to our attention and to the local community for their cooperation and support yesterday while we carried our initial inquiries.\" Adding he understood the upset and anger caused, he said: \"Officers will continue to be out and about in Tenbury in the coming days to assist the local community and our partner agencies with recovery efforts following the flooding.\"\n\nA clean-up is ongoing in Tenbury Wells after the main streets flooded on Sunday\n\nFollowing the wall collapse, a torrent of water deluged the town centre within seconds with rescue workers yelling to pedestrians to \"get back\". Garry and Sarah Thompson's Special Occasions card shop was one of those flooded. \"There's a serious problem in Tenbury now,\" Mr Thompson said. \"We\u2019ve got a risk of businesses leaving the town.\" He said it had taken the town \"a good two years\" to recover from previous flooding in 2007. \"So that's pretty scary,\" he added. Paul and Rachel Rogers, from Nature's Design Studio, described how water entered their shop for the first time after windows broke. \"It's caused so much devastation,\" Mrs Rogers said. \"We have buildings insurance but we don't have contents insurance. It's going to cost us.\" The Crow pub also flooded after water overwhelmed sandbags and smashed through windows. Licensee Paul Birkin described it as a \"miracle\" nobody was hurt. \"[The water] actually hit the back wall you know, I mean there's glass all over the place,\" he said. \"Absolutely distraught.\"\n\nPaul and Rachel Rogers, from Nature's Design Studio, were concerned insurers would not cover the cost of flood damage\n\nWorcestershire county councillor David Chambers described his frustration over the lack of flood defences in the town. The Conservative member said: \"We're lobbying as hard as we possibly can and I have to say there's real frustration now that progress doesn't seem to be happening.\" The Environment Agency said it had been complex to design a scheme in keeping with the town's heritage and funding was needed to deliver it. \"We're working tirelessly to try and get something because we see the impact that Tenbury\u2019s had and it\u2019s not sustainable for that community at all,\" said Nick Green, from the agency.\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Hereford & Worcester",
    "Fixing social care is urgent, says minister, after claims of impasse\n\nReforming the social care system in England is \"urgent\", cabinet minister Louise Haigh has said, after sources told the BBC there was a \"genuine impasse\" at the top of government over the issue. The transport secretary said the government had already taken steps to improve pay and tackle vacancies in the sector, as well as giving councils an extra \u00a3600m in funding for adult and children's social care. In its election manifesto, Labour promised to create a National Care Service to deliver consistent care across the country - but so far the party has given little detail on what this would look like.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for cross-party talks on how to reform the system in the long-term, but said there also needed to be \"immediate measures\". The prime minister, health secretary and chancellor are due to meet in the next 10 days to discuss the issue. Multiple sources have told the BBC the Department of Health is keen to proceed with an overhaul of the social care system but that the Treasury is reluctant to commit to significant costs without clear political backing from Number 10.\n\n\"It\u2019s really urgent that we fix this issue,\" Haigh said. \"For too long we\u2019ve let this problem fester.\" Pressed over whether the government was taking the problem seriously, she told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the health secretary had already set out a 10-year plan for the NHS which included focusing on prevention and community care, which she said would \"ease pressures on social care\". She also pointed to the government's plans to improve pay and conditions in the sector through a Fair Pay Agreement, allowing negotiations between workers, unions and employers. \"We need to make sure we are tackling those long-term issues in the workforce, with progression opportunities, properly paid and properly negotiated on a collective basis,\" she added.\n\nThe adult social care system helps older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and eating, and covers support in people's own homes, as well as care homes. Unlike the NHS, social care is means-tested and people are usually expected to contribute towards the cost. This means some people face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result. Deborah Crisp told the programme how three years ago her 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, had to sell her flat for just under \u00a3200,000 to pay for a care home - and that amount had already been used up. \"Now that money has gone,\" she said. \"The local authority say they cannot fund her to stay where she is and she will need to be moved somewhere else, and we feel that due to her multiple health issues it will be catastrophic for her to be moved elsewhere - and we really fear for her safety.\"\n\nMinisters are considering whether to create a Royal Commission, with cross-party involvement, to look at how to reform the social care system, or a shorter government-backed independent review. Sir Ed said although the Lib Dems would back a Royal Commission there needed to be \"immediate measures first\" and it \"must not be an excuse for long-grassing this\". He said there were things the government could do \"straight away\", for example on tackling vacancies in the sector. The Lib Dem leader called on the government to be \"more ambitious\", pointing to his party's own proposals for a higher minimum wage for care workers. \"Politicians have been failing on this for far too long,\" he told the BBC. \"There are millions of people suffering, families being hit financially, people in misery and pain, and we have got to tackle this.\" He added that the Lib Dems were \"willing and ready\" to take part in negotiations over the issue but he had not yet had a call from Health Secretary Wes Streeting to do so. Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused the government of having \"no plan\" to tackle the issues with social care. He told the BBC the government\u2019s decision to increase the rate of National Insurance contributions paid by employers would also make it \"even more difficult for the care sector to operate\". Providers have warned these increased staffing costs could force some care homes to close.",
    "Conservative leadership: How does the contest work and who chooses the winner?\n\nKemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick were the final two candidates competing to become the new Conservative Party leader. The winner will be revealed shortly after 11:00 GMT on Saturday. Rishi Sunak formally stood down after leading the Tories to their worst performance at a general election in July, but has stayed on as acting leader until his replacement is announced. That person will be the sixth Tory leader in less than eight and a half years.\n\nEach candidate needed the support of at least 10 MPs to get on to the ballot, including a proposer and seconder. MPs could nominate only one candidate per round of voting. This was a much lower bar than during the last leadership election in 2022, when hopefuls needed the backing of 100 MPs. Sunak was the only one to enter the race with that level of support and so became the party leader. There are currently 121 Tory MPs, but those who are also whips or sit on the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee could not nominate a candidate. Applicants were also told they would each need to raise \u00a3200,000 for the party to progress to the final four. On 29 July, the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee announced six contenders had met the requirements: Badenoch, James Cleverly, Jenrick, Dame Priti Patel, Mel Stride and Tom Tugendhat.\n\nConservative members cast their votes between 15 October and 31 October to decide the winner. They made their choice via secure online voting, though this system has previously been criticised for its susceptibility to hackers and rogue state interference. In recent years, party members have tended to pick the more right-wing candidate of the final two. In the first of two leadership elections in 2022, Sunak consistently won more support from MPs than Liz Truss during each round before party members ultimately opted for Truss. To be eligible to vote, party members had to have been active for 90 days before the ballot closed and to have been party members when nominations opened. The new leader of the Conservative Party will be announced on Saturday morning - at which point Sunak will hand over the reins. The winner will become the official leader of the opposition and of Tory efforts to rebuild the party.",
    "Chappell Roan and Ezra Collective on BBC Sound of 2025 list\n\nChappell Roan has also been nominated for six Grammy Awards\n\nBBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 longlist has been announced, with breakout stars like Chappell Roan and Barry Can't Swim joined by newcomers including Myles Smith and Good Neighbours. The award is given to rising artists with \"the best chance of mainstream success\" in the next 12 months. Past winners include Adele, Sam Smith, Michael Kiwanuka, PinkPantheress and Haim. Last year's winners, The Last Dinner Party, went on to score a number one album and a Mercury Prize nomination for their debut release, Prelude To Ecstasy. This year's longlist also includes indie band English Teacher and Northern Irish rap act Kneecap. The winner will be announced on BBC Radio 1 and BBC News in January.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch clips of the Sound Of 2025 nominees\n\nThe 11 acts in the running are:\n\nThe nominees were chosen by a panel of more than 180 music industry experts and artists including representatives from Spotify, the Glastonbury Festival and the BBC; as well as musicians such as Sir Elton John, Dua Lipa, Jorja Smith, The Blessed Madonna and Sam Smith.\n\nPozer posing for the camera on the set of the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland\n\nUS pop star Chapell Roan is the clear frontrunner, after an electrifying year that saw her go from Olivia Rodrigo's backing vocalist to breakout pop star. Rejecting the trend for whispery bedroom pop, her songs are full of cheerleader chants and exuberant hooks that document her coming of age and the discovery of her sexuality. Last week, she was nominated for six Grammy Awards, including best new artist and album of the year, for her debut The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess.\n\u2022 None Find out more about this year's artists, external\n\u2022 None The pundits who voted in the poll Also hotly-tipped are London jazz ensemble Ezra Collective, who won the Mercury Prize in 2023 for their soulful and ebullient album Where I'm Meant To Be. This year's follow-up - titled Dance, No One's Watching - is both an invitation and an invocation, with supple funk grooves that propelled the album into the top 10. Shape-shifting rapper Doechii also makes the list, cementing her rise as one of hip-hop's brightest new voices. Born in Florida, she rose to attention with the viral 2021 hit Yucky Blucky Fruitcake, after which she toured with SZA and Doja Cat. She is also nominated for the best new artist Grammy, and her recent mixtape Alligator Bites Don't Heal was called \"one of the year\u2019s very best albums, external\" by Rolling Stone.\n\nBarry Can't Swim but he can grin while performing at Glastonbury Festival in June\n\nMaking a very different brand of hip-hop are Kneecap, who rap in both English and Irish about the aftermath of the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. The trio, who use the stage names Mo Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap and DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed, released their second album earlier this year alongside a \"mostly true\" movie depicting their origin story. Representing London's rap scene is Croydon-born Pozer, whose debut single Kitchen Stove has been streamed more than 30 million times on Spotify since February. After a period when solo artists were in the ascendance, this year's longlist has a healthy showing for bands, who occupy five of the 11 spots. They include UK pop-rock duo Good Neighbours, who tap into a rich vein of feelgood nostalgia on tracks like Home and Daisies; and Australian electro-pop outfit Confidence Man, already known for their theatrically-choreographed (and fantastically fun) stage shows.\n\nKneecap released both an album and a comedy-drama biopic film in 2024\n\nThere's a second Mercury Prize winner on the list in the shape of Leeds band English Teacher. Combining art-rock angularity with biting social satire, their debut album This Could Be Texas was called \"one of the finest debuts of the decade, external\" by indie publication The Line Of Best Fit. Edinburgh producer Barry Can\u2019t Swim also makes the longlist, following a summer of huge festival appearances that saw crowds swoon to his upbeat, elegaic brand of dance music. The list is completed by rising singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who scored a top 10 hit with the uplifting folk-pop track Stargazing earlier this year; and US guitar prodigy Mk.gee (pronounced \"ma-ghee\"), whose debut album Two Star & The Dream Police has quietly become a word of mouth success. The musician, born Michael Gordon, who's been championed by Frank Ocean, recently made his debut on US comedy institution Saturday Night Live.\n\nNow in its 23rd year, the Sound Of list has tipped everyone from Stormzy and Dua Lipa to Billie Eilish and Lady Gaga for success. This year's nominees may be more recognisable than previous acts were at this stage in their careers. That's down to a change in the eligibility criteria that recognises the difficulties of achieving crossover success in the streaming era.

    "Mysterious 'blobs' are washing up on Newfoundland shore\n\nWhite blobs have been washing up on the beaches of Newfoundland recently, sparking an investigation by Canadian officials. They have been described by resident Stan Tobin as doughy - \"like someone had tried to bake bread and done a lousy job\" - with an odour reminiscent of vegetable oil. Beachcombers on the southern tip of the Canadian province began reporting the strange substance around early September. Ottawa officials told the BBC that they have not fully identified the substance, but preliminary testing shows it is \"plant-based\".\n\nPhotos of the substance began cropping up on a beachcombers group online, prompting speculation that it was fungus or mold, palm oil, paraffin wax or even ambergris - a rare and valuable substance produced by whales and used in the perfume industry. One poster suggested it looked like dough used to make 'Toutons' - a regional dish of dough often fried in pork fat. A spokesperson for Environment and Climate Change Canada told the BBC that they will need to make additional analysis to determine what the substance is and its potential impact. Government officials have visited the site three times to survey the substance, the agency added. The blobs were spotted along the shores of Placentia Bay, on Newfoundland's southeast coast. Mr Tobin, a local environmentalist, lives in Ship Cove, a tiny village on the bay, and regularly walks the beaches.\n\nHe discovered the mystery blobs one day last month, initially thinking it looked like Styrofoam. He's since come across \"hundreds and hundreds of globs - big globs, little globs\" with most about 6in (15cm) in diameter, he said. But when he called the Canadian Coast Guard to report the findings, Mr Tobin was told that was ruled out as the base of the substance. \"Somebody or somebodies know where this came from and how it got there,\" Mr Tobin said. \"And knows damn well it's not supposed to be here.\"",
    "Archbishop of Canterbury to remain in post until new year\n\nJustin Welby resigned from his post last week\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury is to remain in post until the new year following his resignation over his failure to report prolific child abuser John Smyth. In a statement on Wednesday, Lambeth Palace, the London home of Archbishop Justin Welby, said he would complete his official duties by 6 January. Mr Welby announced last Tuesday that he would step down from the role after a review found he \"could and should\" have reported a prolific child abuser to police. He is expected to conduct \"very little public-facing activity\" before leaving the post, the statement said, adding that he \"plans to honour a small number of remaining commitments\".\n\nMr Welby's official functions as the Archbishop of Canterbury - the most senior bishop within the Church of England - will be delegated to the Archbishop of York (the second most senior bishop) during the Feast of Epiphany, on 6 January, which marks the visit of the Magi (also known as the three kings or three wise men) to Jesus. It is the first day after the12 days of Christmas. Lambeth Palace said more details would be provided on this arrangement \"in due course\". \u201cThe date on which Archbishop Justin formally ceases to hold office will be set in agreement with the Privy Council,\" it added.\n\nThe 68-year-old faced mounting pressure to resign following the publication of a damning independent report into child abuser John Smyth's abuse of boys and young men. In a statement last week, Mr Welby said \"it is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility\" for his response after he was first told about the abuse. Mr Welby said he was \"told that police had been notified\" at the time and that he \"believed wrongly that an appropriate resolution would follow\". He also said he believed \"that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England\".\n\nSmyth, a barrister and senior member of a Christian charity, was accused of attacking dozens of boys, including those he met in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. He later moved to Zimbabwe and later South Africa, where he abused up to 100 boys aged 13 to 17, the review said. The report found that by 2013, the Church of England \"knew, at the highest level\" about Smyth's abuse, including Mr Welby who took up the Church's top job that year. If he and other Church officers had reported this to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa at that time, \u201cJohn Smyth could have [been] brought to justice at a much earlier point\u201d, the independent report said. Smyth was under police investigation when he died in South Africa in 2018.\n\nChurch abuse survivors have also called for the resignations of other senior members of the church who failed to report Smyth to police.",

Liz Hatton, 17, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, died in the early hours of Wednesday morning, her mother Vicky Robayna announced on social media. On X, formerly Twitter, Ms Robayna said that Liz had \"remained determined to the last\" and was still making plans for her future on Tuesday. \"We are so very proud of the kindness, empathy and courage she has shown in the last year,\" she wrote.\n\nLiz attending an exhibition of her work hosted by British Land and Getty Images at 2 Kingdom Street, Paddington Central, last week\n\nLiz began a photography bucket list appeal in January after being diagnosed with an aggressive desmoplastic small round cell tumour and was given between six months and three years to live. She was pictured being hugged by Catherine at Windsor Castle in October after being invited to take pictures of the Prince of Wales at an investiture. Catherine, who herself was treated for cancer this year, and William, in a personal message, described Liz as a \"talented young photographer whose creativity and strength has inspired us both\".\n\nLiz and her family saw the Prince and Princess of Wales at a private meeting\n\nMs Robayna said on X that Liz \"was not only a phenomenal photographer, she was the best human and the most wonderful daughter and big sister we could ever have asked for\". \"No-one could have fought harder for life than she did,\" she said. \"There is a gaping Liz-shaped hole in our lives that I am not sure how we will ever fill.\" Ms Robayna offered her thanks to those who helped the teenager fulfil her dreams in her final months and those who liked and supported her work, adding: \"You ensured Liz's last two months were her very best. She flew high until the end.\" She asked people to share one of Liz's photos in tribute and also to support the family's mission to fund research into desmoplastic small round cell Tumour, which has no charity specialising in the disease in the UK. Just a few weeks before she died, Liz had worked with one of her photography heroes, Rankin, at a photoshoot with professional models. After the shoot model Fifi Anicah said the pictures the teenager took were among some of her \"favourite pictures of all time\".

    "Lebanon says 21 killed in air strike in country\u2019s north\n\nResidents said there was no warning before the strike\n\nAt least 21 people have been killed and eight others injured in a rare Israeli air strike in northern Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry says. The strike hit a residential building in Aitou, a predominantly Christian village far from the areas where the Israeli military has carried out thousands of strikes targeting the armed Shia Islamist group Hezbollah. Residents said a family recently displaced by the war had been living there. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reports. But it came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to \"continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon - including Beirut\".\n\n\"Everything is according to operational considerations. We have proven this recently and we will continue to prove it in the coming days as well,\" he added. He was speaking during a visit to a military base in northern Israel where a drone launched by the Iran-backed group killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded dozens on Sunday night. The military said it was investigating how the drone evaded its sophisticated air defence systems and hit the Golani Brigade training facility near the town of Binyamina. It was one of Hezbollah\u2019s deadliest attacks on Israel in over a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said it was a response to deadly Israeli attacks in Lebanon, which the country\u2019s health ministry says has killed almost 1,700 people over the past month. Most of the Israeli air strikes over the past week have struck in the majority Shia south and the Bekaa Valley in the east - areas where Hezbollah is strong. Aitou, a Maronite Christian community located in the mountains near the north-western coastal city of Tripoli, was not a place which would have expected to be attacked. \"Oh mother Mary,\" gasped one man as he walked through the devastation wrought on the village. In the smoke and dust, bodies could be seen on the ground. Residents said there was no warning, just a single, massive blast. However, they also said several families displaced by the war in the south had recently moved to Aitou, and that the house which was hit had been rented out to new people just two weeks ago.\n\nRescue workers attended the scene of the strike, which was covered in dust and debris\n\nA Lebanese security source told AFP news agency that the building was \"targeted shortly after a man had arrived in a car\". The Lebanese health ministry said it was carrying out DNA tests to determine the identities of the remains recovered by first responders at the scene. The main focus of Israel's military operations has been in the east, the suburbs of Beirut and the south - where there have been incidents involving UN peacekeepers. On Monday, a spokesperson for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon would not move from any positions, again defying calls by Israel to withdraw. The UN Security Council has expressed strong concern over some UN troops being injured during the Israeli military's offensive against Hezbollah. Also on Monday, the Israeli military said a strike in the southern Nabatieh area had killed the commander of the anti-tank unit of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan Force. Hezbollah has not commented on the report. The military also said it had struck Hezbollah launchers used to fire a number of rockets into central and northern Israel on Monday. Most of the rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military. One woman was lightly injured by a barrage of 15 rockets that were fired towards the northern town of Karmiel. Israeli police also said debris from an interception fell in the Holon area, south of Tel Aviv, without causing any injuries or damage. The Israeli military said Hezbollah had fired around 115 projectiles into Israel on Monday. Early on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel's air force had over the past day struck \"more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in southern Lebanon and deep within Lebanon, including terrorist cells, anti-tank missile posts, and surface-to-surface missile launchers\", in coordination with ground troops. In southern Lebanon, it said it eliminated \"dozens of terrorists\", dismantled Hezbollah infrastructure and located \"vast quantities\" of weapons and equipment.",
    "A shortage of nuclear isotopes could mean cancer diagnosis delays\n\nLives will be lost because of a shortage of specialist medicine used to detect diseases such as breast and bowel cancer. That is the stark warning from experts who have said the lack of medical radioactive isotopes available in the UK means delays in tests to diagnose cancer. It has also led to renewed calls for the UK to develop its own manufacturing facility, rather than rely on imports of nuclear medicines. It follows a proposal to build a new \u00a3400m medical laboratory at the site of a former nuclear plant in north Wales.\n\nThe scheme dubbed Project Arthur would see a small-scale nuclear reactor placed at Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd, to produce the radioactive materials. The nuclear-based medicine is used to help detect cancer tumours in patients and track the progress of the disease. But there have been no fresh supplies available to be shipped to the UK after a reactor in the Netherlands was forced to halt production for the whole of last month.\n\nProf Simon Middleburgh wants to see the UK have its own nuclear medicine facility\n\n\"For every month that we don't have diagnosis, or a person doesn't have a diagnosis, their chances of succumbing to cancer increase by 10 per cent,\" said Prof Simon Middleburgh, at Bangor University's Nuclear Futures Institute. \"It is actually resulting in people dying from this now. \"These people are not getting the diagnosis, they are not getting those cancers caught early on, cancer will spread, people will die. \"It's going to be hundreds if not thousands due to just this month's shortage in isotopes this time around.\"\n\nProf Middleburgh said it was why he had been backing the case for Project Arthur, which was originally unveiled by the Welsh government in January 2023. A feasibility study was commissioned into the project, and since then a business case is being submitted to the UK government asking for the cash to approve the scheme, providing a home-grown supply of the nuclear isotopes needed for the whole of Britain. \"The business case is there, it's not new technology, it's old technology - we can buy it of the shelf,\" said Prof Middleburgh. \"It's not just a Wales thing - it's an across the UK thing - we're all ready to go, it is just time to press the green button and get on with it.\"\n\nRadioisotopes help medics find and treat cancer in patients\n\nRadioisotopes can be used to diagnose cancer and treat certain types of the disease such as prostate and liver - when they are injected or swallowed and absorbed by cancers from within the body. Using them is a very common way of treating people or diagnosing people in the NHS already. People typically get a dose of the nuclear medicine which is put into their body and it radiates. A gamma, for example, is a type of radiation. When it leaves the body, it can be detected to show its size and location on a scanner. But it should not be confused with external radiotherapy where they blast tumours from outside the body with radiation.\n\nIt is estimated it would take until about 2030 to get a facility up and running, if it was approved now. In the meantime, the UK government's Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to address the current shortages in nuclear isotopes. \"We know this may be concerning for patients and we are working closely with the company involved to resolve the issue,\" said a UK government official. \"We are also working in close partnership with NHS England and the devolved governments to distribute available stock and prioritise patients with critical needs.\"\n\nThe Welsh government insisted it was still behind the proposals for Trawsfynydd, and said it was working with all partners to develop and progress plans. \"We will provide an update on progress in due course.\" However, the Plaid Cymru MP for the area, Liz Saville-Roberts said action needed to be taken sooner rather than later, to help avoid a repeat of the current isotope shortage. \"Welsh government need to be pushing the business case as hard as possible. They need to have it costed, they need to work with Bangor University who will be alongside this, and the UK government has got to recognise - yes - this will cost, but look at the cost if we don't.\" \"We are going to be talking about a cost in life.\"",
    "BBC warned by Met over report into Westwood allegations\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has warned the BBC that parts of a report about Tim Westwood\u2019s alleged misconduct may \u201cinterfere with justice\u201d if published. The external review is to examine the BBC\u2019s knowledge of, and response to, complaints, allegations and concerns about misconduct by the former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ. Mr Westwood has denied claims of misconduct, commenting: \"It's all false allegations.\" The BBC declined to comment. In July, a spokesperson for the corporation said it was liaising with police to ensure that any steps taken - including publishing the report - do not have a \"negative impact\" on any ongoing police investigation.\n\n\"This is taking time,\" it added. Several women have accused the presenter of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in alleged incidents between 1992 and 2017, after a joint investigation by the BBC and the Guardian. In August 2022, a review, led by Gemma White KC, was commissioned by the BBC to examine the near 20-year employment of Mr Westwood with the broadcaster.\n\nIt was initially believed the review would take around six months but a report is yet to be published. In a new statement to BBC News, a Met Police officer said: \u201cWe have seen the report and made recommendations to the BBC as to which sections of the report may interfere with justice if published.\" BBC News understands the report is now due to be published within the next month. In June, the BBC said: \"This is an extremely important ongoing process, led by an independent reviewer. \"As we have said from the beginning, it is essential we fully understand what was known about concerns regarding Tim Westwood\u2019s conduct during his time with the BBC and this remains the priority.\" A freedom of information request by BBC News earlier this year revealed that the BBC has spent more than \u00a33 million on the review so far. It is believed Mr Westwood has been interviewed under caution by the Metropolitan Police four times since the broadcast of the joint BBC News and Guardian investigation. In a statement, police said the offences are alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016. Detectives said they interviewed a 66-year-old man under caution last year. There has been no arrest.\n\nThe women also accused Mr Westwood of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of them said they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18. One said she was only 14 when he first had sex with her. In a video that appeared on social media last year, the DJ was asked whether the allegations were true. He replied: \"It's all false allegations. It's all false allegations. \"I've never done that, period. They're all false allegations. I will prove that as soon as I get my opportunity and trust me, I am ready.\" In April 2022, Mr Westwood stepped down from his Capital Xtra show. The 66-year-old has continued to play in gigs up and down the country, despite some campaigners calling for nightclubs not to host him since the allegations emerged. The Mail Online reported that he had moved to Lagos, Nigeria, for the first half of this year.",
    "Killer 'might have slept' as partner died at bedside\n\nTarnjeet Riaz, also knows as Tarnjeet Chagger, died at her partner's home, a jury heard\n\nA man lost his temper with his partner after a night out before he \"beat and kicked and stamped her to death\", a jury has heard. Raj Sidpara, 50, is accused of murdering his partner Tarnjeet Riaz - also known by her maiden name Chagger - at his home in Leicester on 6 May. He denies murder, but at an earlier hearing on 18 October, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, admitting to killing her, the jury was told. The murder trial opened at Leicester Crown Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe court heard Ms Riaz did not live with Mr Sidpara but had been a regular visitor at his bungalow in Tarbat Road in Leicester since their relationship began some months before her death. Steven Bailey, prosecuting, said: \"This case is about a man who lost his temper with his partner at the end of a night out, and who beat and kicked and stamped her to death in a confined space in his bedroom once he got her home at the end of night.\" The jury was given details of some of Ms Riaz's injuries, including multiple fractured ribs, bruising and lacerations to her lips. A combination of injuries to her head and to her chest were the cause of her death, Mr Bailey said.\n\nMr Bailey added the prosecution's case was that Mr Sidpara inflicted many or most of the injuries to Ms Riaz \"while she was unconscious or helpless\". \"Once he'd inflicted those injuries, he might even have gone to sleep while she died on the floor on the side of his bed in the small hours of morning of Monday 6 May,\" Mr Bailey added. The prosecution said Ms Riaz was dead by the time Mr Sidpara called for an ambulance \"at around lunchtime\". During the 999 phone call, Mr Sidpara was told how to give Ms Riaz CPR, which had failed. Mr Bailey told the jury the CPR had never succeeded because \"by the time Mr Sidpara had called 999, she was already cold and stiff and her jaw locked shut\". Mr Sidpara told the call handler she had fallen over while drunk and suffered injuries that had caused her to bleed, the jury heard. However, Mr Bailey said the prosecution's case was that Ms Riaz's injuries were caused by \"sustained, persistent, deliberate, and intentional application of severe force\". The jury was told how the couple had been out at a bar the evening before, and after Mr Sidpara drove them back to Tarbat Road, they went to see a neighbour, where they drank some more before going home. Both were \"heavy drinkers\", Mr Bailey said. But that night, CCTV from the bar footage showed Ms Riaz \"got drunker than Mr Sidpara\" and that he was \"steadier on his feet\" and even able to drive them back to Tarbat Road \"without issue\". Sarah Vine KC, defending Sidpara, said the jury would need to consider whether Mr Sidpara's \"alcohol dependency\" caused him to behave the way he did when he killed Ms Riaz.\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester",

    "Walker raises a glass as he presents his final Sounds Of The 70s on BBC Radio 2\n\nVeteran DJ Johnnie Walker said \"the day has come I've always dreaded\" as he presented his final Sounds Of The 70s show on BBC Radio 2. The presenter, 79, announced earlier in the month he was retiring from radio after 58 years due to ill health. For his final broadcast on Sunday, Walker confirmed he would not be taking any requests this time as all the song choices would be made by himself, adding: \"I'm playing all the ones I love.\" An emotional final show featured messages from his wife Tiggy and Sir Rod Stewart, before Walker ended by telling listeners \"may we walk into the future with our heads held high and happiness in our hearts\".\n\nWalker became the presenter of Sounds of the 70s in 2009, but his career in British radio has spanned almost six decades. After opening his last show with George Harrison's track What Is Life, Walker then dedicated his second song, Sister Sledge's We Are Family, to his listeners. Walker was joined on air by his former co-presenter Sally Boazman, who said being partnered with him was the \"best luck\" of her life. The pair worked together on BBC Radio 2 Drivetime for seven years from 1999. In a pre-recorded message, Sir Rod Stewart praised Walker for helping the careers of many rock bands. Sir Rod told Walker he had \"propelled the careers of a bunch of unknown layabouts to the top of the charts, and overnight fame and everything that goes with it\". The rock star ended the message by making Walker an offer: \"So if I do manage to get through the pearly gates, I'll have a pint of Guinness, please mate, and guess what? I'll pick up the tab. \"See you later, Johnny. Rock on mate, rock on.\"\n\nWalker joined BBC Radio 1 in 1969, having been a DJ on the pirate station Radio Caroline in the 1960s. He left the BBC in 1976 and later moved to San Francisco, where he recorded a weekly show broadcast on Radio Luxembourg. He returned to the BBC in the 1980s and on 17 January 1987, Walker re-joined Radio 1, presenting the Saturday afternoon show The Stereo Sequence. He has remained at the BBC ever since, and hosted his last episode of The Rock Show on Friday by playing some of his \"favourite rock anthems\".\n\nWalker's wife Tiggy, who sat in on the show as it aired from their home in Dorset, praised her husband for continuing to broadcast after he became \"very ill\" in January. The radio legend was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - a severe respiratory illness that can make breathing very difficult. \"I'm the one person who knows how hard it's been for you, and I just want to say well done for keeping going as long as you have, because you make a lot of people very happy,\" Tiggy said. \"I know there will be a lot of tears out there today, including mine.\" Walker admitted he might shed a tear or two as well as he thanked her for all her \"wonderful care\", adding: \"I certainly couldn't have done the show without that so thank you for that.\" After announcing his retirement, Walker told the BBC: \u201cI get cards from people saying: \u2018You\u2019re the friend I\u2019ve never met\u2019 and things like that. So it will be sad to say goodbye.\u201d Bob Harris will taking over from Walker as the presenter of Sounds of the 70s in November.",
    "Reeves tells firms no more tax rises as she defends Budget\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has told businesses she is \"not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes\" as she defended the tax rises on businesses announced in the Budget. Reeves told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference that despite \"a lot of feedback\" on her tax and spending plans, she had not heard many alternatives. Her comments come after the boss of biscuit giant McVitie's warned it was \"becoming harder to understand\" the case for investing in the UK after the Chancellor's decisions. Reeves announced a near-\u00a370bn increase in public spending in her first Budget last month, of which more than half will come from higher taxes.\n\nBusinesses are set to bear the brunt of tax increases, due to the Chancellor deciding to increase the rate employer's pay in National Insurance, as well as reducing the threshold they start paying it at. There has been backlash to the measures announced, with firms warning not just higher taxes in April, but higher minimum wages, higher business rates, as well as costs associated with new workers' rights, could impact jobs and pay - and ultimately hit the government's goal of growing the UK economy. But Reeves told industry leaders that her Budget provided the \"stability and the platform that we need to move forward\". Asked if she could confirm there would be no more big tax rises on businesses, Reeves said: \"I faced a problem, and I faced into it...we've put our public finances back on a firm footing, and we've now set the budgets for public services for the duration of this Parliament. \"Public services now need to live within their means because I'm really clear, I'm not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.\" While rises in the minimum wage and workers' rights reforms have been praised by unions and workers' groups, bosses have said businesses are being weighed down by multiple changes coming into force at once, with some calling for them to be \"phased in\".\n\nIn her speech to the conference earlier on Monday, Rain Newton-Smith, the boss of the CBI, argued that \"tax rises like this must never again simply be done to business\". She said the policy changes meant businesses were facing \"a tough trading environment that just got tougher\". \"When you hit profits, you hit competitiveness, you hit investment. You hit growth,\" she added. Ms Newton-Smith referred to a recent survey by the CBI, which found almost two-thirds of 185 companies who responded think the Budget will damage UK investment. Salman Amin, the boss of McVitie's, said that most of his investment in the last decade or so had come to the UK, but that it was \"becoming harder to understand\" the case for investing in the country. \"What strikes me is that in the race to grow, we seem to be turning our backs on the industries which have built Britain for decades,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Rupert Soames, chairman of the CBI, said the Budget had made employing young, part time and low paid staff \"much more expensive\". Speaking after Ms Reeves' appearance, he said: \"Many of the things in the Budget are helpful. For instance, the corporate tax road map. \"But there is no doubt here, that in this Budget, business has been milked as the cash cow.\" Last week, a group of major retailers, including Tesco, Amazon and Next, also wrote to the chancellor, external to warn her of the impact tax changes would have. Firms such as Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have said they will face a huge jump in costs and they may need to increase prices for customers. However, others have said that asking multimillion-pound companies to pay more in taxes was one of the fairer ways to improve funding for services like the NHS. \"No-one is questioning that we need to see the tax rises to really help fund our public services,\" said CBI boss Ms Newton-Smith. But she said that firms had been taken aback by the lowering of the threshold for the payment of National Insurance, and that the pain was \"really serious\". She urged government in her speech to consider a number of reforms to improve economic growth, such as giving companies more flexibility around how they spend money using the apprenticeship levy. She also said the chancellor should look at updating business rates for commercial property, as well as simplifying the planning system. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the CBI conference she was concerned the tax burden on business was increasing. \"The new government believes that invisible businesses can absorb these costs, but it is everyday people who bear the brunt, either in higher prices or lower wages, sometimes both,\" the former business secretary said.",
    "Autistic abuse case must never happen again - No 10\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: CCTV footage of children being abused at Whitefield School is shown to parents\n\nThe abuse of autistic children that took place at the Whitefield School in north-east London was \"horrendous\" and \"must never happen again\", the prime minister's spokesperson has said. The BBC has obtained footage of children at the school being shoved into padded rooms, thrown to the floor or left alone, sitting in their own vomit. Responding to the videos, No 10 said the education department was looking at strengthening the guidance on the use of seclusion in specialist schools and would set out more information \"as soon as possible\". Currently the government's guidance says schools can place disruptive pupils in seclusion or isolation rooms for a limited period.\n\nIt also says schools should ensure children are \"kept in seclusion or isolation no longer than is necessary and that their time spent there is used as constructively as possible\". Children's Commissioner for England Rachel de Souza has called for a review \"without delay\" of the use of restraint and so-called \"calming rooms\u201d, following the BBC revelations. In a statement, external, she described the experiences of the children involved as \"absolutely appalling\", saying \"no child should ever be physically restrained under such conditions and with such a lack of compassion, especially those who are so vulnerable\u201d.\n\nRestraint should only ever be used when it was \"essential to keep a child safe\", and then \"for the shortest time possible\u201d, she added. A police investigation was launched after staff at the Whitefield school discovered a box of USB memory sticks containing 500 hours of CCTV taken inside the padded room between 2014 and 2017. The investigation ended earlier this year without any charges. About 40 children with learning disabilities and severe mental disorders were confined for hours in the rooms - typically without food or drink. Six families of the children involved have agreed for the BBC to show the footage. The videos show the children in acute distress and many are seen injuring themselves. Safeguarding expert Elizabeth Swan said it was \"easily the worst footage\" she had seen. \u201cYou look at the children and they're being defeated and responding to that treatment with self-injurious behaviour, it's torture,\u201d she added. The school's local MP Conservative Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the \"jaw-dropping\" footage should lead to \"profound change\". Asked about the footage, the prime minister's spokesperson said: \"The department is looking at the guidance in this space but it is clearly a horrendous case. \"We are clear that this cannot and should not have happened and should not happen again.\"\n\nLeaked CCTV footage reveals how special school pupils suffered while locked away in so-called 'calming rooms'.",
    "My Hurricane Diary: The week I nearly lost everything\n\nAnne, Sam and Georgia Frost at home in Tampa, Florida\n\nHurricane Milton tore through Florida this week. Tornadoes, floods and storm surges have left a trail of destruction and displaced millions of people - at least 16 people have died. Anne and Sam Frost are Brits who moved to Tampa in 2023. They have a five-month-old baby called Georgia. On Monday, after learning that their town was in the route of the hurricane, they evacuated home and travelled to Jacksonville. \"I\u2019ve never felt anything like this, to know by week\u2019s end your whole world could be different, not in a good way and not by choice. It\u2019s like grief without the death,\" Anne told the BBC. While stuck in traffic with others fleeing, struggling to find gas and caring for their child they have been waiting and watching anxiously to see if they would lose their home. Anne shared her diary from the week with us below.\n\nAnne, Sam and Georgia Frost's home in Tampa, Florida. The windows are boarded up with plywood.\n\nSam was fifth in the queue for sand bags at 06:00 (11:00 BST). When it finally opened at 07:45 (12:45 BST) the queue was in the hundreds. He also got plywood for the windows - our local hardware store had a collection point. We have done all we can to protect our home and our belongings and now we protect ourselves and our daughter by leaving. We left at around 20:00 (01:00 BST). We passed several dry gas stations and one with a queue formed of more than 40 cars.\n\nHeavy traffic on the journey from Tampa to Wildwood.\n\nAs we drove we passed blue \"evacuation route\" signs. We joined The I-75 which had heavy traffic, like daytime rush hour. We came off at Withlacoochee and there was another 30-car queue for gas. We were going to stop for food but the Wendy\u2019s drive-thru had about 30 cars queued up. Waze, a navigation app, kept us off the I-75, travelling through little towns on the 301. We travelled down winding roads reminiscent of the UK before stopping for food at a McDonald\u2019s struggling to keep up with the unusually high number of customers.\n\nWe stopped at the 7-11 for gas but even here, in what feels like the middle of nowhere with no evacuation order in place (yet), it\u2019s all out. We finally found a gas station with some pumps available and were able to get another half a tank, but as we drove on we passed more which were completely out. We have arrived in Wildwood and the hotel has a sign on the door - no vacancies at all. We are very lucky to have booked in advance. Tomorrow we will head to Jacksonville.\n\nSome of the traffic encountered by the Frost family.\n\nWe set off from Wildwood at 11:00 (16:00 BST). We were warned to stay off the I-75 by the hotel staff. Waze added 30 minutes to our journey several times. We mainly stayed on the 301 but came off it to avoid standstill traffic at Lawtey. We passed houses that would have no chance of surviving if it were to hit this far north. It all took its toll: our fussy baby, the constant nursery rhymes, and getting lost as Waze tried to help us avoid traffic.\n\nIt\u2019s been amazing as a Brit to see the scale of the logistical efforts that go into preparing for hurricanes. From the enormous dump trucks full of sand to the tankers of fuel being brought in; shelters set up in schools and free Uber rides - it's a remarkable effort. Teco (the energy supplier) has mobilised 4,500 linesmen to be ready to restore power. We\u2019re in Jacksonville now and we just have to wait and watch the spaghetti models (a forecasting tool to give an idea of where a storm could make an impact). As someone commented online, \"we don\u2019t pray it hits somewhere else, we pray it gets weaker.\"\n\nWednesday is spent waiting for updates and watching the radars. The skies are grey and it\u2019s raining in Jacksonville. Hope fades instantly as I hear the reporters say how catastrophic this hurricane will be when it hits. Our house is predicted to get the north side of the eye of the storm - all the wind and rain, so flooding is a risk from overly-saturated ground. And then we see that the storm is predicted to hit north of Sarasota, basically in the bay itself. Any further, tiny jump means we will get surge water from the bay as well. I have to stop watching. It is an anxious wait. At around 21:00 (02:00 BST) the storm carries east when the predicted path was north, which means when it hits it will be south of the bay. For us, it means the bay drains and we will avoid surge water, but for those south it means they\u2019re getting that water, wind and rain. Then come the reports of people who remained in their homes calling for emergency services to get them out, but once hurricane force winds hit the emergency services will not be sent out. I watch the cameras on our house and can see the bushes and trees moving. But as the storm moves through we still have a house intact. It feels incredible, how unlikely it was that we\u2019d have anything left and how close to it we came.\n\nI woke up at 04:00 (09:00 BST) and checked the home cameras - they were still on! And we had no flooding! We\u2019ve lost two fences but it\u2019s a small price to pay. We live near a school so they buried the power cables in the area a few years ago and you realise what a difference that makes, but many are not so lucky as 74% of our county are out of power. There\u2019s flooding as far away from the coast as Plant City and Lakeland so I don\u2019t know how we avoided it. Authorities have closed access to Pinellas County entirely while they assess damage. Our county has boil-water and conserve water notices.\n\nDamaged fences at the Frost family's home in Tampa.\n\nTampa has an area-by-area re-entry plan and again I'm in awe at the logistical efforts and planning. The pictures of damage so close to us and in familiar places are devastating and we are feeling so very fortunate and grateful. Our plans have changed as we can get home earlier now if we want to. So instead of staying another night in Jacksonville we will set off for Tampa via Orlando.\n\nAre you in Florida? Please share your experiences.",

Dowden was taken to hospital as a \"precaution\" after she began \"feeling unwell\" during the main show two Saturdays ago. The professional dancer posted on Instagram, external on Monday to say she was heartbroken after being forced to pull out of the series with a foot injury. Fellow pro Lauren Oakley will take her place, pairing up with Dowden's celebrity partner, JLS singer JB Gill.\n\nA spokesperson for the BBC show said the professional dancer will not come back as she \"focuses on her recovery\" from the injury. \"The whole Strictly family sends Amy love and well wishes,\" the spokesperson added. Oakley stood in for Dowden last Saturday, with the pair performing a Bruno Mars medley scoring 39 points. It took them to the joint top of the leaderboard, alongside former Love Island star Tasha Ghouri and her dance partner Aljaz Skorjanec.\n\nJB Gill performed with Lauren Oakley on Saturday night, as Amy Dowden watched from the studio\n\nDowden returned to the Strictly line-up in 2024, having missed the previous series after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Two Saturdays ago, an ambulance was called to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood when the dancer began feeling unwell. The following day, a spokesperson for the dancer said the ambulance \"was called as a precaution\" and that she was now \"feeling much better\". But in a statement on Monday, a Strictly spokesperson said: \u201cSadly, Amy Dowden MBE will not be partaking in the rest of the competition this year. \"Whilst Amy focuses on her recovery following a foot injury, fellow professional dancer, Lauren Oakley, will step in as JB\u2019s dance partner.\" The spokesperson said the \"health and wellbeing\" of everyone on the show are always \"the utmost priority\". Following the announcement, Dowden said in an Instagram post: \"My heart is breaking right now. The past few months I finally felt like me again. Cancer was no longer the first thing I thought of when I woke up. It was choreography, music choices, which dances in which order, what we needed to work on. I felt free again. \"My goal since hearing those words, 'You have cancer' was to get back on the Strictly dancefloor. It\u2019s been such a challenge to get back, one I devoted 2024 to which, with my incredible team, we got there. Something I wanted to do for myself and loved ones.\" She added: \"There was no feeling like it, dancing again in the ballroom with [the] Strictly family\". She also thanked dance partner JB, saying she was \"so sad, so upset and asking why me, why now that our journey has been cut short\". JB replied to her post, saying \"our moments will forever be in Strictly history\". Lauren Oakley then responded with a vow to \"carry your partnership [with JB] forward and hopefully make you proud\". And Strictly judge Motsi Mabuse also replied, saying that Dowden's courage and strength was an inspiration. Dowden was initially diagnosed with stage three breast cancer aged 32 in May 2023, after finding a lump in her breast the day before she went on her honeymoon. The now-34-year-old was diagnosed again later that same year. She returned to hospital in August 2024 for further tests, as doctors were concerned about abnormalities in her breast after a check-up. She was later given the all-clear. Dowden opened up about her ordeal with breast cancer in a BBC documentary, Strictly Amy: Cancer and Me, which was broadcast in September. She also has Crohn's disease - a lifelong condition which causes parts of the digestive system to become inflamed - and has previously spoken about its toll on her health. Oakley, who did not have a celebrity partner this year, joined the BBC show in 2022. Last year, Oakley was partnered with Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy.

    "'Glorious light' goes out - shock at Robins' Coventry exit\n\nMark Robins took charge of 420 games for Coventry, over two spells - the second-most in club history\n\nEven the English Football League's most durable manager has succumbed. Thursday's sacking of Mark Robins by Coventry City is another stark reminder that the ruthlessness of football - and its insatiable demand for winning - comes for every boss in the end. And so, after seven years, eight months and one day, Robins' second reign at the club is over. Ended after defeat by Derby County - their seventh in 14 Championship games. Only Manchester City's Pep Guardiola has stayed at one club longer, across the top four divisions, than the 54-year-old former Manchester United striker managed with the Sky Blues in his second stint. But, despite four Wembley trips, two promotions, a trophy win, and an FA Cup semi-final few will ever forget, Coventry owner Doug King has opted to go in a new direction. BBC Sport looks at the reaction to the decision to get rid of a man the club described as \"one of the club's greatest ever managers\".\n\nLegendary former Coventry City goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic played more than 500 times for the club and was part of their 1987 FA Cup winning team. Ogrizovic, who now works as a pundit for BBC CWR, said: \"Very few things in football shock me but this is a poor decision. \"It's not a knee-jerk decision because I think this is planned and Doug King has got a plan in the back of his mind, although what that is I don't know.\" Despite a slow start to the season for the third campaign in a row, wins against Luton Town and, impressively, at Middlesbrough, seemed to give Robins a bit of breathing space. But Wednesday's 2-1 defeat by the Rams was one too far for King. \"Mark Robins had more to give, look at the club since the day he came in and it's been year-on-year success and progression,\" added 67-year-old Ogrizovic. \"The sun has been shining on Coventry and they got back into the Championship and along the way there were some great memories for people. \"The stadium is full now and it wasn't when Mark Robins first came to the club.\"\n\nSteve Ogrizovic started his career with Chesterfield and had spells with Liverpool and Shrewsbury before becoming a Coventry City legend after 16 years and more than 500 appearances for the club.\n\nAnother former Sky Blues player David Prutton has paid tribute to what Robins achieved against the backdrop of financial constraints and the prospect of dragging the club back up from the bottom tier of the EFL. \"When I played for Coventry they were dark days so what Mark Robins gave back to that football club was just glorious light and illumination,\" Prutton, who had a brief loan spell at the club in 2014, told BBC CWR. \"He's got the same demeanour win, lose or draw which enables a team to climb the mountains they did. \"The fact he outperformed budget and expectations year on year is another feather in his cap.\" Key to that was getting the very best out of the squad and Prutton cites the work Robins did with striker Viktor Gyokeres - now one of the hottest properties in Europe thanks to his Champions League hat-trick against Manchester City. \"He bought him for about \u00a31m and sold him for \u00a324m, so he's ticked so many boxes, on the pitch for the fans to watch, enjoy and love, and off the pitch for the bean counters who want to make the football club a viable financial asset,\" Prutton added. \"We can all get into metrics and statistics but if anyone classes Mark Robins' tenure as a failure I would say that suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of what football means to people who love the game and are passionate about their club.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLifelong Coventry supporter and BBC CWR sports editor Rob Gurney has pretty much seen it all in his time covering and following the club. He says Robins leaving has once again illustrated the contrasting emotions being a fan and a journalist often present. \"Am I gutted? Of course. Am I surprised? Not in the least,\" he said. \"Football doesn't respect a manager's history or reputation, but you could argue Mark Robins was a special case. \"Yes, he left once, under a cloud. But, since his return in March 2017, he's pulled the club back from the brink. \"Winning the EFL Trophy within weeks of his return, instantly endeared him to Sky Blues fans again. \"An immediate return from League Two, after another memorable Wembley trip, cemented that relationship still further. \"Then we saw the League One title secured during Covid, were a missed penalty kick away from the Premier League, and most gut-wrenchingly of all, a toe-nail killed the greatest FA Cup comeback ever. \"Championship form tailed off, completely understandably, after the physical and mental exertions of that semi-final.\" Gurney added that the timing of that hangover was unfortunate, given the club's pronounced public relations strategy coming into this season. \"Then a very aggressive summer marketing campaign 'Think Big, Aim High' fuelled expectations of a promotion push, but a slow start, for the third season running, sealed Robins' fate. \"My perception is the back-to-back wins over Luton and Middlesbrough came as a huge inconvenience to owner/chairman Doug King, particularly the supporters' response to Robins personally, in the face of going 2-0 down in the first of those. \"His, and his players, in-game management, has been scrutinised in recent weeks, although he'd appeared to have bought himself a little more time. \"Now King has made the decision to dispense with the man many fans regard as the modern-day Jimmy Hill, his next one could define the City's destiny for years to come.\"\n\nMark Robins leaves Coventry for a second time having returned as manager in March 2017\n\nAs with any manager departure, the decision has triggered a frenzy of reaction from the club's supporters. Dave called sacking Robins \"madness\" and wondered \"who is out there that can realistically do a better job\". Another fan, Chris described his mood as \"absolutely devastated\" adding \"what a man he has been for the football club. It just doesn\u2019t make sense\". \"Mark thank you for everything you have done, us fans hold you in higher regard than our apparent owner. Gutted\" The club's mini recovery pre-Derby left Jesmondos thinking Robins had earned more time: \"Wow, really? That man worked wonders. Coventry fans would know best but surely he deserved a bit more time and trust?\" Another supporter Jamie said he thought the club's search for a replacement \"head coach\" was a potential sign why Robins' time is over. \"Sounds like there was a touch of some internal politics in this move, with the club statement saying their next appointment will be a 'head coach' rather than a 'manager',\" he said. \"Coventry haven\u2019t started this season well, but not sure it was bad enough to justify sacking their greatest manager of the 21st century.\" The last thought goes to G-Man - who perhaps perfectly sums up the fickleness of football: \"The saviour that nearly knocks Utd out of the cup one minute, to no longer viewed as up to the job.",
    "'We couldn\u2019t get a mortgage so live in a mobile home'\n\nEoin McGovern and his son outside their mobile home\n\nA man living in a mobile home with his young family says owning their own home in the Republic of Ireland \u201cfeels impossible\u201d. Eoin McGovern from County Cavan had a mortgage application rejected when his wife became pregnant, so they moved into a mobile home on the grounds of his mother\u2019s house. \u201cI would just love for my kids to have their own bedroom. Being confined to a small space is very disheartening,\" he said. Housing is one of the most hotly contested issues in this week's Irish election.\n\nEoin McGovern's mobile home is on the grounds of his mother's house\n\nThe Ballyhaise native lives with his partner and two young children. He said: \u201cWe had an initial mortgage acceptance offer from our bank, but then when my partner received her first maternity payment into our account, everything changed and the mortgage was denied.\u201d Mr McGovern added: \u201cIt was a very tough time, because we fell between the cracks. We couldn\u2019t afford to rent and we\u2019re above the threshold to qualify for social housing. \u201cThe idea for the mobile home was a temporary solution until we both could start working again when the kids were old enough for creche and we would be in a position to re-apply for a mortgage, but it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\u201d The 31-year-old hotel worker was contacted by Cavan County Council and informed that without planning permission the mobile home was against regulations.\n\nEoin, his partner and their two children in their mobile home\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame the council, I honestly didn\u2019t realise you needed planning permission because it\u2019s on wheels on my mother\u2019s property,\" he said. \u201cThe council could come tomorrow and take it away, I pray to God that doesn\u2019t happen and I just hope we\u2019re able to get a temporary planning exemption, just to give us some sort of chance.\u201d BBC News NI contacted Cavan Council but a spokesperson said it did not comment on individual cases.\n\nAlthough the circumstances will vary, Mr McGovern and his family aren\u2019t alone. The average price of a property in the Republic of Ireland as of September this year was \u20ac346,000 (\u00a3289,000). In Northern Ireland the average price is \u00a3190,000. James Spring is an estate agent in County Cavan. He believes that with properties at this value, it\u2019s not surprising it\u2019s proving difficult for young couples to buy their first house.\n\nJames Spring is an estate agent in County Cavan\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number one story I hear is about mortgages expiring after six months, then you have to re-submit everything again and if your circumstances have changed, your mortgage offer can be in doubt. \u201cIt\u2019s why housing is such a big issue in this election because young people are struggling, they\u2019re getting out-competed in the market and lending rules with banks seem to have really tightened up.\u201d Mr Spring said it is a \"supply and demand\" issue with not enough houses being built in the Republic.\n\nWaiting lists and social housing are also an issue. There are around 58,000 people are on the social housing waiting list in the Republic. Martin Loughran is chief commercial and development officer with Tuath Housing. The company has just finished an 11-storey apartment building in Drogheda, County Louth. All the homes will be occupied by individuals and families on the social housing waiting list. Mr Loughran believes a substantial increase in projects like this will be needed throughout Ireland to chip away at the waiting list.\n\nMartin Loughran is Chief Commercial and Development Officer with Tuath Housing\n\nIn Northern Ireland recently, news headlines have been dominated by the fact that a lack of access to water and sewerage systems is preventing people from being able to move into homes \u2013 including social housing developments. Mr Loughran said there is a similar problem in the Republic. He added: \u201cThere has been talk of setting up a Department for Infrastructure in the Republic of Ireland to support the Department of Housing in government, we would be supportive of that and I think it\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nHousing has been a key issue in the Irish election campaign\n\nMany commentators will say the Republic\u2019s ongoing housing issues can be traced back to the financial crisis in the late 2000. This saw a reduction in public investment and it\u2019s argued by some, that successive governments have struggled to hit housing targets ever since. Whatever the cause, for people like Eoin McGovern and his family, they\u2019ve been left feeling like the system is working against them. He said: \u201cIf I had a time machine I would try and get a house before I had kids because when you\u2019re trying to get a decent mortgage with dependents in this country, it\u2019s nearly impossible. \u201cThis election will come and go, but things are going to stay very tough out there for families like us for a while yet.\u201d",

    "Seven-month-old Elle Doherty died on 16 June, an hour after being attacked by her family's pet dog\n\nA seven-month-old baby who was attacked by her family's pet dog, died after she suffered a \"catastrophic\" head injury, an inquest has heard. Elle Doherty was on the floor, near her parents, when the 31kg Belgian Malinois made a \"sudden and unanticipated\" attack, Coventry Coroner's Court heard. Area coroner Delroy Henry concluded the attack at the family home in Coundon on 16 June lasted \"less than a second\" as the dog, called Zeus, was immediately pulled away. Elle suffered skull fractures and a cardiac arrest, and was pronounced dead in hospital an hour after the attack.\n\nHer parents did not attend the inquest hearing after expressing what Mr Henry said was a \"wholly understandable\" wish to be excused. A series of freeze-frame CCTV images recorded from an indoor security camera at the family's home, showed the couple's immediate response to protect their daughter. Commenting on the stills, Det Insp Anthony Hibbert agreed with Mr Henry's suggestions that the incident \"transpired within a second or less\" and that both parents \"immediately reacted to this situation by removing Zeus from the equation\" and taking hold of both the dog and Elle. Det Insp Hibbert told the inquest: \"It appears from when you watch the footage, maybe baby Elle slightly leant on Zeus and that is when Zeus attacks baby Elle.\"\n\nIn a written statement, Mr Doherty said the pet had been acquired from a breeder in Gloucestershire in October 2020 and was \"good around people and other dogs\". The inquest heard a dog-handler was called to the scene and used a sedation dart to remove Zeus from the garden. The dog was taken to a vet and put down on the same day. Bringing the inquest to a close, Mr Henry said: \"This is certainly a tragic incident - a family changed forever. \"I really don't think there are any words that I could say to console the family of Elle save to reiterate that my heart goes out to Elle's parents and family.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Warwickshire",

Her sister Yasmine, who is still in school, said she would have never imagined leaving, but the situation required it. Another British citizen, Libby, 25, boarded a commercial flight from Beirut to Cairo on Wednesday morning, and described the situation in the Lebanese capital as \"terrifying\". \"You can't sleep because you can hear the Israeli drones over your head, you wake up in the night because you hear strikes,\" she told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. The chartered flight leaving Beirut on Wednesday will only be able to take a fraction of them, raising questions about whether additional flights will be needed.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey was in Cyprus on Wednesday to meet some of the British personnel preparing for the possibility of evacuating UK nationals out of Lebanon. Britons in Lebanon have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website. Healey's visit to Cyprus came just hours after Iran carried out a missile attack against Israel on Tuesday night. The defence secretary said British forces had \"played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation\u201d. He gave no further details but the BBC understands British military jets did not shoot down any Iranian ballistic missiles nor did the Royal Navy Destroyer, HMS Duncan, fire any Sea Viper missiles. Iran said the attack was, in part, retaliation for the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of its proxy, Hezbollah, in a strike on Beirut last week.\n\nYou can get in touch via this form.\n\nAre you a British national planning to leave Lebanon?

    "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has defended Labour's stance on its staff volunteering for Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. She told the Commons that \"people in their own time often go on campaigns\", adding that \"it happens in all political parties\". Speaking at PMQs Rayner said no laws had been broken and the campaigners were volunteers. Donald Trump's campaign filed a complaint alleging Labour had broken US election rules on foreign interference by sending activists to campaign for Harris, his Democratic Party opponent. Rayner was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer, who earlier played down the row while on his way to Samoa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nRayner was responding to a question from Stephen Flynn, leader of the SNP at Westminster, who invited her to join him \"in applauding the brave Labour staff members who travelled across the Atlantic to campaign against Donald Trump\". The deputy PM replied: \"People in their own time often go and campaign, and that's what we've seen. \"It happens in all political parties, people go and campaign and they do what they want to do with their own time, with their own money.\" The row over campaigning was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from Labour's head of operations, Sofia Patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to America before polling day. The LinkedIn post said she had \u201c10 spots available\u201d for anyone willing to travel to North Carolina to campaign for Harris, adding \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d. Foreign nationals are permitted to volunteer in political campaigns in the US as long as they are not compensated, according to Federal Election Commission rules. Labour Party sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is concern about whether the row could impact the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US should Trump win the election on 5 November.\n\nOn Wednesday, Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill pulled out of a guest appearance at an online event on US election night in support of Harris. McNeill had been due to speak at a Labour for Women meeting called \"Come on Kamala\" in a \"personal capacity\" to provide election analysis, a government spokesperson said. However, her appearance had drawn criticism online and from the shadow Scottish secretary John Lamont, who accused McNeill of \"hosting a fully fledged rally\" for Harris. The Trump campaign complaint to the Federal Election Commission flags that senior Labour Party staff attended the Democratic convention in Chicago and met Harris\u2019s campaign team, naming Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, and Matthew Doyle, Downing Street director of communications. Deborah Mattinson, Sir Keir\u2019s former director of strategy, was also named as someone who travelled to Washington in September to brief Harris\u2019s campaign on Labour\u2019s election-winning approach. It is understood from Labour officials that Labour met McSweeney\u2019s costs, while Doyle was hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, a US think tank. But the officials said it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the Harris campaign, adding that Labour sends a delegation to each Democratic convention. Officials also pointed out that Mattinson left the Labour party staff after July's general election in the UK.\n\nSir Keir briefly addressed the issue during his plane journey, telling reporters: \u201cThe Labour Party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election. \"They\u2019re doing it in their spare time. They\u2019re doing it as volunteers. They\u2019re staying I think with other volunteers over there.\u201d He denied the row would impact his relationship with Trump, reminding reporters the two had dinner together at Trump Tower in New York last month. The prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson stressed that the UK would always have \u201ca deep and strong relationship with the US as our closest ally\u201d whoever won the election. She was not aware of any plans for government ministers to speak to Trump\u2019s campaign team, but Sir Keir and Trump had discussed \u201cthe long-standing friendship\" between the two nations during their New York dinner, she said. \u201cIt is a special relationship which has endured for over a century with leaders of all political stripes, and that will always be the case,\" she added. Defence Secretary John Healey suggested the Trump campaign was \"creating controversy\" ahead of the presidential election. However, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Trump supporter, told the BBC he believed the wording of the LinkedIn post breached US election law, saying the rules were \"very, very clear\".\n\nFarage, who has travelled to the US to support his friend on multiple occasions, said: \"The ad didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll be going in your own free time, didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll have to pay your own air fare, which at the moment, by the way, are very, very expensive, it said you\u2019re going to have free accommodation. \"If you look at the wording of that advert there is little doubt that is against American election law.\" Filings with the US Department of Justice reveal that Farage himself has received help three times since his election as an MP in July from a PR firm based in Pennsylvania, including with hotel costs on a trip to the USA. The company, Capital HQ LLC, is run by Alexandra Preate, who used to be an aide to Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon. The filings show the firm paid more than $3,500 (\u00a32,700) for Farage\u2019s accommodation at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July. It also helped with his \u201cperception management\u201d, as well as public relations, travel and logistics. Capital HQ disclosed it had also assisted with his appearance on a Fox News business programme in July, in which he was outspoken in support of Trump\u2019s election prospects. It also spoke to him in August about an \u201cupcoming trip to the United States\u201d. The filings were made under US laws requiring anyone who acts on behalf of foreign \u201cprincipals\u201d engaged in political activity, such as seeking to influence policy or public opinion there, to register with the federal government. The Clacton MP has declared \u00a332,836 he separately received from a donor for flights and accommodation for a visit to the United States in July. Asked about this on BBC\u2019s Politics Live programme, Farage said he \u201chopped on somebody else\u2019s plane, they gave me a free lift\", adding that he had declared it and \"didn\u2019t campaign at all\". \u201cI went in a purely personal capacity to offer my support after the first assassination attempt... as a friend of his and the family\".",
    "'Adult crime, adult time': Row as Australian territory locks up 10-year-olds again\n\nA protest was held outside the Northern Territory's parliament in Darwin as MPs debated lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 10\n\n'Thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison. Following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory (NT). He was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary. Five years on, the Aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard changing,\u201d Thomas tells me. \u201c[Breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it\u2019s hard to [stop] the habit.\u201d His story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the Northern Territory. For many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. The Northern Territory is the part of Australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average, external. It\u2019s also more than twice the rate of the US, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. But the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. The move, which defies a UN recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people.\n\nBusiness owner Sunil Kumar says his restaurant had five or six break-ins in the last year and is in favour of tougher laws\n\nIt's not just an issue of incarceration. It's one of inequalities too. While around 30% of the Northern Territory's population is Aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are Indigenous. So, Aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. The Country Liberal Party (CLP) government says it has a mandate after campaigning to keep Territorians safe. It helped the party claim a landslide victory in August's elections. Among those voting for the CLP was Sunil Kumar. The owner of two Indian restaurants in Darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. \"It's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun,\" explains Mr Kumar. He says he\u2019s improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. \"How come they are out and parents don't know?\u201d he says. \u201cThere should be a punishment for the parents.\" But while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. Youth offender rates have risen since Covid. Last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. But the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the Northern Territory, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show. Politicians, though, are playing to residents\u2019 fears. As well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as Declan's Law, after Declan Laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. \"I never want another family to experience what we have,\u201d said his mother Samara Laverty. \"The passing of this legislation is a turning point for the Territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place.\"\n\nOn the day the laws started to be debated in Darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. One woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. Another asked: 'What if it was your child?' \"Our young people in Don Dale need to have opportunity for hope,\" said Aboriginal elder, Aunty Barb Nasir, addressing the demonstrators. She was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside Darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in Australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. \"We need to always stand for them because they are lost in there,\" Aunty Barb said. Kat McNamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill, told the crowd: \"The idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt.\" After a ripple of applause, she added: \"We are not going to stand for it.\" But with a large majority in parliament, the CLP easily managed to pass the laws.\n\nProtesters opposing the new law argue that jailing 10-year-olds is not a sustainable long-term solution\n\nLowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. And while other Australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. Australia is not alone \u2013 in England and Wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. But in comparison, the majority of European Union members make it 14, in line with UN recommendations. The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Lia Finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can \"intervene early and address the root causes of crime\". \u201cWe have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time,\u201d she said last month. \"And we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more.\" But for people like Thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. His crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. He says he finds prison oddly comforting. It's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. \"Most of my family has been in and out of jail. I felt like I was at home because all the boys took care of me.\" His two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. At one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. Thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now \u2013 his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. He's been helped by Brother 2 Another - an Aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports First Nations children caught up in the justice system.\n\nDarren Damaso, from the program Brother 2 Another, says there should be more investment in services to support young Aboriginal people\n\n\"Locking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,\" says Darren Damaso, a youth leader for Brother 2 Another. \"There needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards Aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. And then we're going to slowly start to see change. But if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work.\" Mr Damaso is from the Larrakia Aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of Darwin, and he also has connections to the Yanuwa and Malak Malak people. His organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. Brother 2 Another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. \"It's a self-perpetuating cycle,\u201d says John Lawrence, a Scottish criminal barrister who's been based in Darwin for more than three decades. He's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. Aboriginal people \u201chave no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm\", says Mr Lawrence. \"The fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.\u201d\n\nThe tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the Northern Territory. In Queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the Liberal National Party played heavily on its slogan: \u201cAdult crime, adult time.\u201d In a recent report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, Anne Hollonds, the National Children\u2019s Commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them First Nations children - the country is creating \"one of Australia's most urgent human rights challenges\". \u201cThe systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer.\u201d Which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. \"What are the cultural strengths of people? What are the community strengths of people? We are building on that,\u201d says Erin Reilly, a regional director for Children's Ground. Her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the Aboriginal 'kinship\u2019 system - how people fit in with their community and family. \u201cWe centre Indigenous world views and Indigenous values and we work in a way that works for Aboriginal people,\u201d explains Ms Reilly. \u201cWe know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people.\" For Thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. But on the outside, he says, there\u2019s little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. \"I felt like no one cared. Nobody wanted to listen,\" he says. He points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: \"So, I hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?\"",
    "UK-Israeli hostage has been forgotten, says mum\n\nEmily Damari loves to watch Tottenham play, her mother said\n\nThe mother of the only British-Israeli hostage still being held by Hamas in Gaza has asked why the UK is not \"fighting every moment to secure her release\". Emily Damari, 28, was shot and taken from an Israeli kibbutz across the border into Gaza on 7 October. Speaking at a London memorial event marking the attacks a year ago, her mother Mandy Damari said her daughter's \"plight seems to have been forgotten\". Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement the UK \"must unequivocally stand with the Jewish community\".\n\nThe dual national is among 97 hostages who remain unaccounted for. Speaking at the Hyde Park memorial event, her mother said: \"[Emily] is a daughter of both countries, but no one here mentions the fact that there is still a female British hostage being held captive by Hamas for a year now, and I sometimes wonder if people even know there is a British woman there. \"Imagine, for a moment if Emily was your daughter. Try to picture what she is going through. \"Since 7 October last year, she has been held a hostage by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza terror tunnels, 20 metres or more underground, kept in captivity, tortured, isolated, unable to eat, speak or even move without someone else's permission.\u201d\n\nThe crowd heard how Emily, who was born to her British mother in Israel and lived there, loved to visit the UK - her \"second home across the sea\". She loved watching Spurs play, going to the pub, shopping at Primark and had also watched Ed Sheeran in concert, her mother said. Her mother pleaded with Britain and other countries to do more to secure the release of her daughter, and the other hostages. \u201cHow is it that she is still imprisoned there after one year? Why isn't the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release? She's one of their own.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Mandy Damari: ''I need to hug her again''\n\nShe said some of the women and children who were released in the hostage deal in November had told her Emily was alive then, and spoke about how she helped the other hostages try to stay positive, even in the worst of times. \u201cEvery day is living hell not knowing what Emily is going through. I do know from the hostages that returned that they were starved, sexually abused and tortured. Every moment lost is another moment of unimaginable suffering or even death.\u201d BBC News has approached the UK Foreign Office for comment. Other hostages with British relatives held include Eli Sharabi, Oded Lifschitz and Avinatan Or. British-Israeli Nadav Popplewell was also kidnapped on 7 October and his body was recovered by Israeli soldiers in Gaza in August. Families of Israeli hostages met Sir Keir and Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Monday, calling on them to \"do more\" to bring them home. The prime minister agreed that the hostages must be freed and returned immediately, a subsequent press conference was told. On Sunday, he said the country must \"unequivocally\" stand with the Jewish community and described 7 October as the \"darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust\u201d. \u201cAs a father, a husband, a son, a brother \u2013 meeting the families of those who lost their loved ones last week was unimaginable. Their grief and pain are ours, and it is shared in homes across the land,\" Sir Keir said. He also reiterated his call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nMemorial attendees held up pictures of hostages during the event\n\nThe Hyde Park event, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and other groups, was attended by thousands of British Jews and supporters of Israel who waved British and Israeli flags with chants of \"bring them home\". Among the crowd, many of whom have family and friends in Israel, there was disbelief that the hostages still had not been freed, one year on. Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely told the crowd: \"We will do whatever we can to bring them home.\" Michael Wegier, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told BBC News: \"The British Jewish community is traumatised like much of the Jewish community around the world, especially in Israel. \"There are 30,000 Jews from Britain who live in Israel. Many of us have friends and family there and we go there, and so we take what happens there very deeply and very personally.\" A vigil to remember the victims of the Hamas attack was also held in Glasgow where hundreds gathered at the steps of Kelvingrove Art Gallery. On the eve of 7 October, a man was filmed damaging a Jewish memorial in Hove. Sussex Police responded to the video, which had been circulated on X and other social media platforms, and confirmed the incident was being treated as a \"hate crime\", external. On Saturday tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors marched through central London calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the escalating conflict in the Middle East. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. At least 41,870 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "A coroner has delivered her conclusions at the inquest into the death of Brianna Ghey\n\nSchools involved with one of Brianna Ghey's killers could not have foreseen that she and her accomplice would have plotted to murder the teenager, a coroner has ruled. Jacqueline Devonish, senior coroner for Cheshire, found the transfer of Scarlet Jenkinson to Brianna's school had been appropriately managed and had not contributed to the 16-year-old's death. She also said Brianna\u2019s own health had not contributed to her death, except that it had made her vulnerable to manipulation by Jenkinson. Jenkinson, along with Eddie Radcliffe, murdered Brianna at a park in Warrington on 11 February 2023.\n\nAn earlier trial heard how she had lured Brianna to Culcheth Linear Park, where she was waiting with Ratcliffe. The pair, both 15, were convicted of Brianna\u2019s murder and sentenced to life in prison earlier this year. The coroner said there had been no reason for anyone to suspect that the friendship between the two girls had been anything but genuine.\n\nBrianna had been a pupil at Birchwood High School, Warrington, where she was befriended by Jenkinson. Jenkinson had been transferred from Culcheth High School after she \u201cspiked\u201d a younger pupil with cannabis-laced sweets. Following her \"managed transfer\" from Culcheth, where Ratcliffe was also a pupil, Jenkinson became obsessed with Brianna and began plotting her murder with Ratcliffe. From age 14, Jenkinson had watched videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers, her trial heard. But these \"dark fantasies\" were not known to either school or any other adults, the trial heard. The three-day inquest at Warrington Coroner\u2019s Court examined safeguarding for all three teenagers, and how Brianna was brought into contact with Jenkinson. But the hearing was told despite Jenkinson\u2019s misbehaviour in school, no-one could have foreseen she was planning to murder Brianna.\n\nConcluding the inquest, Ms Devonish said: \"There was no reason for anyone to suspect the friendship was anything other than genuine. She said there were no visible signs that Brianna was at risk from Jenkinson. \"She had been planning Brianna\u2019s murder since late 2022. Eddie Ratcliffe was the only person who knew, other than Scarlett Jenkinson,\" Ms Devonish said. \"I found that the schools could not have reasonably foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe would have plotted and murdered Brianna. \"It could not have, on the evidence available at the time, reasonably have been foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson was mentally unstable so that she would kill.\" Both Brianna and Jenkinson had a history of self-harm and personal issues affecting their schooling. Jenkinson had also assaulted another pupil and turned up for class drunk and smelling of cannabis. Brianna, who was transitioning gender, had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Her mother Esther Ghey said Brianna had become \"immersed in darkness\", falling behind in schoolwork and spending a lot of time online, garnering thousands of followers on TikTok and YouTube by posting video content. The coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, but said there was no need for prevention of future deaths reports to be sent to either school.",
    "'It didn't have to happen': Wife of man killed at Trump rally struggles with loss\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \u201cI see it every time I close my eyes,\u201d says widow of man killed at Trump rally\n\nThe wife of a former volunteer fire chief killed during July\u2019s assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, has told the BBC she is furious about the security failures that led to her husband\u2019s killing by a rooftop gunman. Corey Comperatore was shot dead after diving on members of his family to protect them as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire at the former president. His wife Helen said she hasn\u2019t been able to stop replaying the events of the day in her mind. \"I see it every time I close my eyes, and probably will for a long time\" she said. \"I'm angry because there were a lot of mistakes made that day, and it didn't have to happen,\u201d she added. Helen Comperatore spoke exclusively to the BBC just days before Trump is set to return to Butler and the site of the shooting. The home she shared with Corey in Sarver is less than 20 miles (32 km) from the Butler rally site, and close enough to the volunteer fire station where he worked for decades that when its sirens blare they can be easily heard. Trump will hold a rally on Saturday on the same grounds where he was shot in the ear, before defiantly raising his fist and mouthing \u201cFight!\u2019, in what has become a defining image of his campaign. Multiple members of the Comperatore family will be Trump's guests at this weekend's rally, including Helen. Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the July shooting and two other people suffered \u201clife-changing\u201d injuries: 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver. A Secret Service internal review has since identified a litany of security failures that day, including poor planning and a communication breakdown. Corey, who was an ardent supporter of the current Republican presidential candidate, had been excited for the July rally, his wife said. \"He just liked how [Trump] got things done, and that he wasn't a politician and he didn't talk like one.\" She said they believe Trump understands the lives of people like them, in places like Butler, a working-class community just north of Pittsburgh.\n\nAt the rally, the family ended up by happenstance in the bleachers between Trump and the shooter. They'd taken time to eat beforehand and missed the opening to get a seat - to Corey's disappointment. But then a man came by and offered them a spot in the stands. About six minutes into Trump\u2019s speech, Crooks fired eight shots from a roof just outside the rally\u2019s perimeter, one striking Trump\u2019s right ear and one striking and killing Corey as he sheltered his family.\n\nIn the months before her husband was killed, the couple spent every weekend on their boat. \"We loved that time together,\" Helen said. \"We talked about everything. We made a lot of future plans on that boat. I knew a lot about Corey and what his wishes were, if anything ever happened to him.\" The couple had known one another their entire lives - they began attending school together as kindergartners. She said her husband often appeared straight-faced and serious, but behind the fa\u00e7ade was a deeply kind and caring man. \"As soon as he smiled, you knew he was a good, good man,\" she said. \"He did anything for his community. He loved his kids. His kids were everything to him.\" His two daughters, Allyson and Kaylee, are nurses and struggling to get back to work while they grieve their dad, Helen said. She said now the questions of \"What would he want me to do? What would Corey do?\" help guide her. \"It's definitely a struggle. I realised I always knew he took care of me, but I never realised just how much. I just miss him,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCorey Comperatore was honoured at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July, with his helmet and coat displayed on stage as Trump spoke. Helen said at the July rally, Corey had hoped - and joked - that Trump might call him on stage. The family watched the RNC moment on television, after Trump told Helen about the planned tribute. \"And I just cried because I said he got his moment on stage with Trump,\" she said. \"So, you know, it was kind of like a nice moment, but it was a sad moment at the same time.\"",
    "Nationally an uninsured car is seized by police every three-and-a-half minutes, the Motor Insurance Bureau said\n\nMore than half of the top 15 hotspot areas for uninsured drivers are within the West Midlands region, latest figures show. The two worst offending postcodes were B11 and B21 in Birmingham, and WV2 in Wolverhampton was in fourth place, according to claims data from the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB). West Midlands Police seized more than 6,500 uninsured vehicles last year, Paul Farley from the MIB said. \"It is a challenge, the police are doing lots of work and we're really trying to make a difference,\" he said.\n\nB18, B8 and B33 in Birmingham also featured on the list, along with WS4 in Walsall and CV7, which covers parts of Solihull and Warwickshire. Historically, London has been on the list, but has not appeared for the past two years, Mr Farley said.\n\n\"We tend to find in metropolitan city areas such as Birmingham and the Black Country we do experience higher crime levels, these are linked to uninsured driving and there are some socio-economic factors also play into this as well,\" Mr Farley said. \"When we see uninsured drivers in one particular area, it means then that local road users are more at risk, which is why we're collaborating very closely with West Midlands Police to tackle the problem.\" Working with the police, Mr Farley said they were trying to \"bear down\" on the \"small proportion of the motoring population that drive intentionally without any insurance, sometimes with no MOT or tax\". \"Please do not drive if you're uninsured,\" he added. \"You could really affect yourself in the future and other motoring members of the public too.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Wolverhampton",
    "British national and several Turkish citizens abducted in Kenya\n\nNecdet Seyito\u011flu lived in the UK for 18 years before moving to Kenya\n\nA British national has told the BBC that he and several Turkish citizens were abducted in the Kenyan capital Nairobi by masked men on Friday, with four of the Turkish citizens still missing. Necdet Seyito\u011flu, who lived in the UK for 18 years before moving to Kenya two years ago, said he was released after eight hours when he showed his alleged abductors a copy of his British passport. In a statement, the UK Foreign Office said they were \"providing consular support to a British man and his family following an incident in Kenya\". Kenyan police told the BBC they were investigating a \"kidnapping incident\" after a motorcycle driver witnessed the abduction.\n\nAccording to the report, two vehicles intercepted and blocked from the front and behind a silver saloon car with two occupants. \"About eight persons armed with weapons emerged from the two vehicles, pulled out the two occupants\" and drove off with them, said Kenyan police spokeswoman Resila Onyango. \"Later, one Yusuf Kar, a British national of Turkish origin\" reported to a nearby police station and identified the kidnapped men as H\u00fcseyin Ye\u015filsu and Necdet Seyito\u011flu. Turkish authorities have not yet commented on the incident. Mr Seyito\u011flu, an education consultant, gave additional details of what he said happened during his kidnapping ordeal, some of which differ from the police account. He described a white SUV intercepting his car as he was leaving home for work with a friend at 07:30 local time (04:30 GMT). The pair were blindfolded and handcuffed by four armed men before being driven off to an unknown location, he said. Repeated requests about what was happening went unanswered, he said. \"We asked them, can you show your identification? Where we are going? But we didn't get any kind of explanation,\" the 49-year-old said. \"It was the worst experience of my life,\" Mr Seyito\u011flu added.\n\nHe said he was eventually able to convince his alleged abductors that he was a British citizen by showing them a copy of his passport on this phone. After taking a photo, the men received a call that sounded like it was an instruction to release him, he said. The masked men, who Mr Seyito\u011flu said spoke Swahili, then dropped him off at a place he did not recognise and gave him 1,000 shillings ($7.50; \u00a36) for transport back home, but refused to return his phone and laptop. During this time, Mr Seyito\u011flu said his wife reported him missing, and informed the British High Commission. Mr Seyito\u011flu said six other people he knew - all Turkish citizens - were also abducted in the same manner from different locations in Nairobi. A local law firm, Mukele & Kakai, said in a statement that it was acting on behalf of four men who were registered refugees and warned airlines against allowing them to be brought on board. \"Our clients were abducted in Kenya with the aim of being deported back to Turkey where they are victims of political victimisation,\" the lawyers' letter, seen by the BBC, said. This was echoed by the campaign group Amnesty International, whose Kenya spokesman said he was \"deeply concerned by reports that seven asylum seekers from T\u00fcrkiye have been abducted on Kenyan soil\". The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, told the BBC it was \"aware of reports and will provide more information once we have it\".",
    "Chris Philp was previously a junior minister in the Home Office\n\nChris Philp has been appointed shadow home secretary by new Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch. The former Home Office minister supported Badenoch's leadership campaign. On Monday it emerged that Badenoch had offered three of her former leadership rivals senior roles. Robert Jenrick, who was beaten in the final round, will serve as shadow justice secretary, while Mel Stride will be shadow chancellor and Dame Priti Patel will be shadow foreign secretary. Badenoch has now named her full shadow cabinet team ahead of their first meeting on Tuesday morning.\n\nEd Argar, a former justice and health minister, has been made shadow health and social care secretary, while Claire Coutinho keeps her job as shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, as well as taking on the shadow equalities brief. Philp was first elected as MP for Croydon South in 2015 and before joining Parliament set up businesses in finance and travel. As well as serving as a junior minister in the Home Office under Rishi Sunak, he has previously held a number of other government roles including briefly serving as chief secretary to the Treasury under Liz Truss. Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet leans heavily on those who supported her leadership campaign. Of the line-up, 15 backed her, five did not declare for either of the final two, and just three backed Jenrick, including Jenrick himself. Some Conservatives are already noting that it is strikingly similar to a line-up Sunak could have selected. Nine of the new shadow cabinet have been at the real cabinet table - perhaps unsurprising for a party which has just been ejected from government but nevertheless a sign that Badenoch has not opted for a radically fresh team. One senior Conservative told the BBC: \"For a party that just had a right vs right leadership contest the almost total absence of the right will not help.\" They warned that right-wing Conservative MPs, who mostly backed Jenrick\u2019s campaign, are now more likely to agitate against Badenoch\u2019s leadership. Badenoch said her new shadow cabinet \"draws on the talents of people from across the Conservative Party, based on meritocracy and with a breadth of experience and perspective\". She added: \"We will now get to work holding Labour to account and rebuilding our party based on Conservative principles and values. \"The process of renewing our great party has now begun.\" By giving jobs to some of her former rivals in the Tory leadership race, as well as figures from different wings of the party, Badenoch will be hoping to unite the Conservatives after they suffered their worst ever general election defeat in July. However, there was wrangling over which, if any, job Jenrick would take. The BBC has been told he turned down several roles before eventually accepting shadow justice secretary. The pair clashed during the final weeks of the leadership contest, with Jenrick accusing Badenoch of being \"disrespectful\" to Tory members by choosing not to set out detailed policies. Badenoch defended her approach, saying she did not want to rush into deciding policies and make promises before she knew how to deliver them. She had hoped to give jobs to all of the former leadership contenders but James Cleverly - who came third in the contest - ruled himself out before the results were announced on Saturday. Tom Tugendhat, who came fourth, is not listed as a member of Badenoch's top team. He is thought to have been offered a role but decided to go to the backbenches.\n\nBadenoch narrowly beat Jenrick to become the new Tory leader\n\nFormer Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott had already been confirmed as shadow education secretary, with Neil O\u2019Brien appointed shadow education minister. Both appeared in their new roles in the House of Commons at Education Questions on Monday. Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves said: \"Instead of turning the page on 14 years of Tory government, Kemi Badenoch\u2019s shadow cabinet shows that the Conservatives have learnt nothing. \"How can the new Conservative leader claim to be changing the Tory Party when most of her team were ministers for Liz Truss as they crashed Britain\u2019s economy, or claim to want to uphold standards when most went AWOL for the vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s antics at Partygate?\" The Liberal Democrats branded the appointments a \"cabinet of contradictions\" and \"a recipe for yet more Conservative chaos\". The party's Cabinet Office spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"How can they claim to be able to hold this new government to account when they have just as many disagreements with each other?\"",

Dolly Parton sings 'Helene' as she pledges $1m in hurricane relief\n\nMusic icon Dolly Parton has announced she will make a personal donation of $1m (\u00a3762,000) towards disaster recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Speaking at an event in her home state of Tennessee on Friday, the 78-year-old said the money would come \"from my own bank account\". Parton's local commercial ventures - including the Dollywood amusement park - would also donate the same amount to the Mountain Ways Foundation, which is aiding those affected by flooding in the region. During her remarks, Parton broke into song, singing \"Helene, Helene\" to the tune of her 1973 hit Jolene. At least 225 people have died due to Helene, which tore through the south-east US in late September.\n\nHelene is the deadliest mainland storm since Katrina in 2005. Making landfall as a category four hurricane, Helene damaged structures, caused flash flooding and knocked out power to millions of homes. Over half a million properties remain without electricity as of Saturday. The US government has said the clean-up effort could take years. While a large proportion of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, others have been recorded in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. \"This is my home,\" Parton said at Friday's news conference, which took place outside a Walmart store in Newport, Tennessee. \"God has been good to me and so has the public, and I feel that if there's anything I can do to give back in any way I can I'm always willing to do that. I want to feel like I'm doing my part.\" Explaining that many of her relatives lived in the area, the singer said: \"I was heartbroken like everybody else, and just amazed and devastated by it.\" She added: \"All these people feel like my people.\" Eleven people have so far been confirmed dead in Tennessee due to the storm, according to the latest official tally, external, with more still unaccounted for. At least two factory workers were swept away by floodwaters in Erwin, in the north-east of the state.\n\nHelene damaged structures, caused flash flooding and knocked out power to millions of homes\n\nParton, when asked what her message to victims was, responded: \"I know it's easy for us to say, 'oh, things are going to get better' when things are still really bad.\" \"All we can say is that we are with you, that we love you, we hope that things get better real soon - and we're going to do our part to try and make that possible.\" Coinciding with the news conference, Walmart announced it was increasing its recovery efforts funding to $10m (\u00a37.6m). The supermarket chain's CEO, John Furner, said: \"These aren\u2019t just places where we have stores. These are communities where we work and live.\" He also described Parton as \"a true American legend - and not just for the music, the art, the business, but because of her heart\". The country music singer-songwriter has previously made large donations in response to life-changing events. In 2016, her charity pledged to donate $1,000 a month to families affected by wildfires in Tennessee. And in 2020, she contributed $1m towards the development of one of the Covid-19 vaccines.",
    "Donald Trump has announced that he will appoint Karoline Leavitt, his campaign spokeswoman, to serve as White House press secretary in his next administration. At 27, Leavitt will be the youngest White House press secretary in US history. The president-elect said in a statement that he was confident the one-time candidate for Congress - who also served in the White House press office during the first Trump administration - would \"excel at the podium and help deliver our message to the American People as we Make America Great Again\". \"Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,\" Trump said.\n\nA native of New Hampshire, Leavitt studied communications and political science at Saint Anselm College, a Catholic college in her home state. While still in school, she interned at Fox News and in Trump's White House press office. She told Politico in 2020 that she gained her \"first glimpse into the world of press\" through these experiences. They led to her decision to pursue a career in press relations, she said. Leavitt began working for the first Trump White House shortly after graduating in 2019, first as presidential speechwriter and later as assistant press secretary, according to the website for her 2022 run for Congress. \"I helped prepare Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany for high-pressure briefings [and] fought against the biased mainstream media,\" her website stated. After leaving the White House, Leavitt served as the communications director for Elise Stefanik, a senior Republican congresswoman whom President-elect Trump has nominated to serve as United Nations ambassador. Leavitt departed that role to run for Congress, winning the Republican nomination for New Hampshire's first congressional district in 2022, only to lose in the general election to Democrat Chris Pappas. The policy positions she listed on her campaign website largely align with many of Trump's priorities. On the economy, she pledged to \"CUT taxes\" and \"champion pro-growth, free market policies\". She presented herself as a strong backer of law enforcement and strong borders, including \"ZERO tolerance for illegal immigration\" and said she would work to ensure the completion of the border wall. In January 2024, she joined Trump's third bid for the US presidency as his campaign press secretary. Now, she's been chosen to serve as the youngest White House press secretary in US history. Ron Ziegler was the previous record holder. In 1969, he was appointed to the position by Richard Nixon when he was 29. The public will soon see Leavitt in the iconic spot behind the podium in the White House briefing room - a space that led to countless tense exchanges between members of the press and officials in Trump's first administration. Trump ran through multiple press secretaries during his first four-year term, including Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephanie Grisham and Kayleigh McEnany. After departing the White House, Sanders went on to win the race for Arkansas governor. Grisham resigned after the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot and has become a Trump critic. McEnany has continued to advocate for the president-elect as a Fox News personality.",
    "England hang in and earn rewards in the City of Saints\n\nThey call Multan the City of Saints. There were times on the first day of the first Test against Pakistan that England must have hoped for help from the patron saint of taking wickets. An inexperienced attack, the most docile pitch, sun burning hot enough to make statues sweat and a Pakistan captain determined to make up for 10 consecutive winless home matches. This was as tough as it gets. Still, England stood up. Despite skipper Shan Masood plundering 151, supported by Abdullah Shafique\u2019s 102, the tourists stuck at it. As the light faded and the second new ball shone, the gift of Babar Azam plonking his pad in front of the stumps was nothing more than England deserved. At 328-4, Pakistan had the better of the day, but England\u2019s smiles and high fives as they made their way to the dressing room showed they have taken something from it. A good start to day two and they will be right in the match. There was a temptation to think that England could simply pick up where they left off here two years ago, when a 3-0 series win was perhaps the greatest ever in a foreign country not called Australia or India. It was certainly the peak of the Bazball era to date.\n\nBut there is plenty different to 2022. Despite their wretched run, Pakistan look stronger on paper than they did then. A subtle change is the time the series is being played. December then to October now doesn\u2019t sound much, but the elevation in temperature is uncomfortable. The biggest difference is the make-up of England\u2019s pace attack. Gone are the retired James Anderson (more on him later), the injured Mark Wood and Ollie Robinson has been sent to Coventry. In their place have come the notoriously travel-sick Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, a summer revelation but untried away from home, and Brydon Carse, untried anywhere and only just off completing a ban for historic gambling offences. It was the seamers who were key to England\u2019s previous success here. Whereas in 2022 the spinners largely matched each other \u2013 England\u2019s took 33 wickets at an average of 37.3, Pakistan\u2019s 35 wickets at 36.2 \u2013 the touring seamers comfortably out-bowled the hosts. England claimed 26 victims at 23.3, Pakistan just 11 at a whopping 62.7. Some help from the toss would have been appreciated, but Ollie Pope has now lost four out of four standing-in for injured England skipper Ben Stokes. If England were looking for assistance from the pitch, they were left disappointed. Pre-match talk of grass was dashed by a mower on Monday morning. A penny for the thoughts of Saim Ayub, who somehow tickled Atkinson\u2019s 10th ball in an away Test down the leg side to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith. He had to watch Shafique and Masood plunder runs from the fourth over of the day until well after tea.\n\nAccording to data analysts Cricviz, the Multan pitch was the second-flattest for day one of a Test anywhere in the world since they started collecting such information in 2007. Across the three sessions, the 0.47 degrees of swing was the least amount of movement in the air for day one in Pakistan since the beginning of 2022. If there was nothing to encourage the seamers, the spinners got little more. The 2.64 degrees of turn was the second-lowest for the opening day in this country over the same time period. Shoaib Bashir struggled \u2013 only once in his short Test career has he bowled more overs without taking a wicket - but Jack Leach impressed in his first Test since January. Despite all of the disadvantages, England hung in. The fielding was never anything but wholehearted, the only error being Pope\u2019s miss at the stumps when Shafique should have been run out on 34. Aside from that, Pope did a fine job at recreating the creativity of Stokes that was crucial to England\u2019s win in 2022. Bowlers were shuffled, fields tinkered. Shafique\u2019s eyeline was flooded with catchers in front of the bat and he eventually popped Atkinson to cover. Left-armer Leach toyed with his angles to come round the wicket to left-hander Masood and was rewarded with a return catch. The only mild criticism was an over-eagerness to bowl bouncers, a favourite tactic of England. Carse, who touched 90mph, was asked to go to the short ball as early as the 15th over of the match. Overall, 40% of the deliveries Carse sent down were bouncers, 61% short of a good length. It is a plan England often revert to for bowlers with extra pace. Jamie Overton bowled 34% bouncers in his only Test against New Zealand in 2022 and Olly Stone 33% in his two Tests against Sri Lanka earlier this year. Wood, albeit faster and more skilful than the other three, is not used as such a blunt instrument. Perhaps the biggest boost for England was the late impact of Woakes. Quiet for most of the day, he grabbed the second new ball to produce a nip-backer that removed Pakistan\u2019s best player in Babar. The UK is on its fifth different prime minister since Woakes\u2019 previous Asian Test wicket in 2016. It was a delivery worthy of Anderson, the absence of whom was made much of in the build-up to the Test. England\u2019s bowling consultant has been playing golf at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. When Anderson does arrive in time for day two, he will join a team that can be optimistic following their first-day showing. In truth, unless England were going to ask Anderson to take the new ball, there seems little he could have passed on to the bowlers that would have made their job any easier. In the City of Saints, England did just fine without Saint Jimmy.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",
    "Lilly Ledbetter is seen here with former US president Barack Obama\n\nLilly Ledbetter, whose name graces an equal pay law in the US, has died aged 86. CBS, the BBC's news partner in the US, quoted her children as saying she died peacefully on Saturday surrounded by family and loved ones. Ms Ledbetter's activism led to the first bill signed into law by Barack Obama after he became US president in 2009.\n\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act made it easier for workers to sue after discovering they were being discriminated through pay. Mr Obama said that the law sent the message \"that there are no second-class citizens in our workplaces\". President Biden, who was vice-president during the Obama administration, described Ms Ledbetter as a \"fearless leader and advocate for equal pay\". He paid tribute, saying \"her fight began on the factory floor and reached the Supreme Court and Congress\" and she \"never stopped fighting for all Americans to be paid what they deserve\". \"Before she was a household name, Lilly was like so many other women in the workforce: she worked hard, with dignity, only to find out she was being paid less than a man for the same work.\" Biden added it was \"an honour to stand with Lilly as the bill that bears her name was made law\", describing the Fair Pay Restoration Act as a \"critical step forward in the fight to close the gender and racial wage gaps\". Ms Ledbetter worked as a supervisor for Goodyear, the tyre manufacturer, in Alabama for nearly 20 years before discovering she was being paid less than men doing the same job. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had no grounds to sue because her complaint had not been lodged within six months of the discrimination first taking place. Her law overturned that ruling. The former president paid tribute on Twitter/X, saying Ms Ledbetter \"never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work\". \"Lilly did what so many Americans before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even higher for her children and grandchildren,\" Mr Obama said. Ms Ledbetter continued her advocacy after the law was signed. She received the Future Is Female Lifetime Achievement Award from Advertising Week last week, according to the Alabama news site AL.com. A new film about her life, called Lilly and starring Patricia Clarkson, has recently been shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",

Mayer took Ryan's WBO welterweight title via a majority decision on Friday. Before the bout, the 31-year-old from Derby was had red paint thrown over her as she made her way from her hotel to The Theater inside Madison Square Garden. On Monday, Ryan said she had also been threatened and subjected to a \"disgusting and pathetic smear campaign\" on fight day. She claimed that \"defamatory\" leaflets were distributed before and after the fight, that her team received threatening messages and that she was advised to leave New York \"for her own safety\". After her victory, Mayer, 34, said she was \"shocked\" to hear about the paint incident and that it had nothing to do with her or her team. \"In light of everything that\u2019s happened, I believe that an immediate rematch should be ordered,\" Ryan posted on social media on Monday. \"I felt the fight itself was close but I thought I did enough to retain my title. ESPN had me winning by two rounds and I know many other respected boxing observers also had me winning the fight.\" Two of the scorecards read 97-93 and 96-94 for Mayer, while a third judge saw it a 95-95 draw. The pair have known each other since their amateur days but have become involved in a bitter feud over training arrangements after Ryan relocated to Mayer\u2019s gym in the United States. They were involved in a fiery news conference on the eve of the fight.\n\nOn Saturday, Ryan said she \"shouldn\u2019t have fought\" after the paint incident but now insists pulling out of the bout was never an option. She also said the New York Police Department (NYPD) have told her they are investigating the incidents but the NYPD would not confirm this when approached by BBC Sport. \"I\u2019ve too much pride and have worked too hard to let incidents as pathetic as these force me out of a fight \u2013 especially when that fight gave me the opportunity to fulfil a dream of headlining a card at Madison Square Garden live on ESPN,\" Ryan said. \"I have dedicated my life to this sport and am very grateful for the opportunities it has given me.

    "Dozens of people descended on a Chicago park on Saturday, vying to be crowned best Jeremy Allen White lookalike. Contestants \u2013 including a toddler \u2013 donned chef\u2019s aprons and white t-shirts in the style of White\u2019s character Carmen Berzatto from the hit TV series The Bear. Others dressed as his character Phillip in Shameless, another TV show set in Chicago. Hundreds of spectators cheered as each contender stepped forward to show their resemblance. Based on levels of applause, the accolade went to a 37-year-old mental health therapist, Ben Shabad.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really plan on winning \u2013 especially when I saw all these guys that looked like Jeremy Allen White \u2013 but the energy here is so exciting,\u201d Mr Shabad told the Chicago Tribune. As a prize, Mr Shabad received $50 and a pack of cigarettes \u2013 a nod to Berzatto\u2019s heavy smoking in the series. The show, now in its third season, follows a young chef from the fine dining world, Carmy, as he returns to the family-run sandwich shop in Chicago after his brother's suicide. The show won six prizes, including three for acting, at the 2024 Emmy Awards, drawing with Succession for the most accolades. The lookalike competition was organised by Chicago roommates Kelsey Cassaro and Taylor Vaske. The pair were inspired by the success of similar events in recent weeks for other celebrities including Dev Patel and Paul Mescal. In October, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stunned fans after turning up to a lookalike competition for the actor in New York. It appears the celebrity doppelganger craze is not yet over, with Saturday's event just the latest in a string of competitions across the country.\n\n\u201cPeople were online saying, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Chicago have one?\u2019 said Ms Cassaro, speaking with the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cI was like, \u2018I think it should be Jeremy Allen White if we do it.\u2019 And I also think a lot of Chicago dudes look like him,\u201d she added. Cassaro and Vaske originally planned the event as a joke, posting details on social media and flyers in areas of Chicago. Once buzz picked up online about it, they decided to organise it officially. Unlike Chalamet, White did not show up to the competition. But that didn\u2019t dampen his doppelgangers' spirits. \u201cI\u2019m just impressed by [White\u2019s] acting ability, and the shows that he\u2019s been in have been really good, so I take it as a compliment that people think I look like him,\u201d said Mr Shabad.",

    "China's giant sinkholes are a tourist hit - but ancient forests inside are at risk\n\nSinkholes in China's Guangxi province have become a tourist attraction\n\nThe couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff. More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs. For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored. People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths. But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.\n\nRui and Michael ahead of their trek into the sinkhole\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air. Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge. He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes. Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.\n\nThis is the only way into a sinkhole...\n\nBut once you reach the bottom, a forest awaits\n\nEventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child. \u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were. \u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.\n\nBrother Fei, now a veteran sinkhole guide, avoided the caves as a child\n\nSinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground. Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide. For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails. Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.\n\nThere is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down. This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave. After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock. That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position. \u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave. This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d\n\nThe tourists descend further into the cave\n\nVideos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty. There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult. Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note. Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing. Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d\n\nBut there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research. About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d. \u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.\n\nThe viewing platform in Dashiwei claims to be the world's highest\n\n\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance. \u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d. As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us. Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole. \u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him. He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave.",
    "Migrant took own life after 'multiple failings' at UK detention centre\n\nFrank Ospina took his own life in immigration detention\n\nAn inquest jury has found \"multiple failings\" and \"missed opportunities\" at an immigration detention centre contributed to a Colombian man taking his own life in 2023. The coroner examining the death of Frank Ospina said he had been let down by the state \"in numerous ways\" which were \"utterly regretful\". Last year the BBC revealed Frank Ospina had died in the detention removal facility despite being willing to return home to Colombia. The jury found his case should have been reviewed because of his worsening mental health, which could have led to him being released. Offering its condolences, the Home Office said steps had been taken since Mr Ospina's death to improve safeguards for individuals in detention.\n\nFrank Ospina, 39, an engineering graduate, came to the UK in late 2022 to visit his mother, who had settled here, and to visit prospective universities. Having decided to instead enrol on a master's course in Spain, which was due to begin in May 2023, he took a short-term job washing dishes, his family say. But as a foreign national Mr Ospina did not have the right to work in the UK. He was arrested in an immigration raid and taken to the Heathrow detention centres. Behind bars he suffered a mental health crisis and on 26 March 2023 was found dead at the Harmondsworth facility, having strangled himself. The inquest jury concluded that he had killed himself.\n\nFrank Ospina suffered a mental health crisis while detained and awaiting removal from the UK\n\nThe jury's key finding centred on a detention centre rule that medical staff should report any detainee suspected of having suicidal intentions. The failure to submit a rule 35.2 report meant Frank Ospina's release from detention was never considered by the Home Office, the jury concluded. His mother visited him but was separated from him by a glass wall which the jury described as \"inappropriate and unnecessary\". It \"contributed to the deterioration of his mental health and incurred further stress\", the jury decided. Staff on duty that night made \"unacceptably inadequate observations\" of Frank Ospina, failing to spot he was not in his bed. He was found out of sight, having strangled himself.\n\nThe Coroner, Lydia Brown, offered her condolences to his family telling the court \"the state took Frank Ospina into detention and this jury found they let him down in numerous ways and of course his family down that is utterly regretful and now irretrievable.\"\n\nFrank Ospina was detained at Harmondsworth alongside failed asylum seekers and former foreign criminals. He told a charity he was prepared to be removed from the UK under a voluntary return scheme and was not trying to avoid deportation. His brother-in-law, Julian Llano, told the BBC: \"He kept insisting that he felt very bad, mentally, that he needed to get out of there. \"He didn't ask for help - he begged for help, not only to us, but also to the people there.\"\n\nHarmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre is Europe's largest detention facility and can hold up to 676 men.\n\nImmigration detention centres are run like prisons, but many of those detained have committed no crime. They are held while the authorities prepare for them to be removed from the UK. The Ospina case highlighted ongoing concerns about the management of immigration centres, six years after a BBC investigation revealed the abuse of detainees at Brook House near Gatwick. The chair of a public inquiry into that scandal said in September only one of her 33 recommended changes had been carried out by the government. Yet the centres are under growing pressure because the government is planning to remove more failed asylum seekers as part of a plan to reduce small boat crossings.\n\nA spokesperson for Mitie, which runs the Harmondsworth facility, said \"the physical and mental wellbeing of those in our care is of the utmost importance to us\". \"We accept that the decision to place Mr Ospina\u2019s family in a closed room for their visit was wrong and not in accordance with our policies and procedures, and we have apologised for this.\" \u201cA number of measures have already been implemented and we will continue working with the Home Office and Practice Plus Group to address the matters raised by the Coroner.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe offer our sincere condolences to Mr Ospina\u2019s loved ones, and since his death in 2023 a number of actions have been taken to improve the safeguards for individuals in detention, including an increase in staffing numbers, training and guidance for staff. \u201cThe new government is focused on ensuring actions are taken to improve conditions in detention facilities, including reviewing the current process for communicating risk and vulnerability of detained individuals. \u201cWe will carefully consider the coroner\u2019s recommendations.\u201d If you or someone you know are feeling emotionally distressed, details of organisations offering advice and support can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",
    "Alex Salmond took part in a panel discussion at the conference in North Macedonia before collapsing during lunch\n\nA man who witnessed Alex Salmond collapse during lunch at an event in North Macedonia has said that \"time stopped\". Youth conference organiser Mark Donfried said Scotland's former first minister was caught by a fellow delegate as he fell backwards in his chair after suffering what is thought to have been a massive heart attack. The event was cancelled as paramedics tried in vain to resuscitate Salmond. A statement from his family paid tribute to a \"formidable politician\" and a \"devoted and loving husband\" following the former SNP leader's death on Saturday at the age of 69.\n\n\"Alex was a formidable politician, an amazing orator, an outstanding intellect, and admired throughout the world,\" the family said in a statement released by The Alba Party. \"He loved meeting people and hearing their stories, and showed incredible kindness to those who needed it. \"He dedicated his adult life to the cause he believed in - independence for Scotland. His vision and enthusiasm for Scotland and the Yes movement were both inspirational and contagious. \"But to us, first and foremost, he was a devoted and loving husband, a fiercely loyal brother, a proud and thoughtful uncle and a faithful and trusted friend.\" Tributes have also poured in from across the political spectrum. Speaking on Sunday morning, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said Salmond \"inspired a generation\" to believe in independence.\n\nSwinney, who served as finance secretary while Salmond was first minister, said he took the party from the fringes of Scottish politics to the heart of government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described Salmond as a \"monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics\", while King Charles paid tribute to his \"devotion to Scotland\" during decades of public service. Floral tributes have been left outside the Scottish Parliament and Salmond's home in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. The former SNP leader was Scotland's first minister between 2007 and 2014, and in recent years led the Alba party. Mr Donfried, executive founder and director at the Academy for Cultural Diplomacy (ACD), said Salmond had been an \"active member\" of his organisation. He told BBC Scotland News: \"For many of the young leaders here he was really a role model and he inspired many of them.\" Speaking from Ohrid in North Macedonia, he said: \"We are all still in a state of shock and that is not something we can easily move forward from.\"\n\nFloral tributes to Salmond have been left outside the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh\n\nMr Donfried said Salmond had delivered a speech at the conference on Friday then attended dinner that evening where he discussed plans for an ACD event in Scotland next year. He said the former MP and MSP had seemed in the \"best of health, the best of spirits\". But the following day during lunch after a panel discussion, Salmond took ill and lost consciousness at the table. Mr Donfried raced to the hotel reception to request an ambulance. He added: \"By the time I came back he was on the floor and they were trying CPR.\" When paramedics arrived there was nothing that could be done to save him. The Interior Ministry of North Macedonia confirmed Salmond passed away at 15:30 local time (14:30 BST).\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMr Donfried said he had been told the cause of death was suspected to be an \"immediate massive heart attack\". \"The good news is he didn't suffer. I don't think he felt any pain.\" Describing the aftermath, he said: \"Really time stopped. The entire hotel, the entire conference was in shock. \"Most of the participants here were young leaders and none of them had ever experienced anything like this. \"I think there was a feeling of shock, a feeling of loss and of not really knowing what to do.\" Those attending the event gathered later to share reflections and give thanks and prayers for Salmond's life.\n\nSalmond pictured at the conference on Friday alongside Alba Party chair Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh\n\nMr Donfried recited a prayer that was shared during his late father's funeral. \"That was important for us all, to have a moment to come together and pause in honour of Alex.\" He added that Salmond, the leader of the Alba party, was \"a great leader who inspired so many\". Mr Donfried said: \"I was speaking to some of the Spanish participants last night and they were talking about how in Spain he is, in so many ways, a legend.\" He said ACD, which is based in Berlin, had received many messages from across the world since Salmond's sudden death. Mr Donfried said the organisation was in close contact with the British Embassy and that the repatriation of Salmond's body may involve the Royal Air Force. He added: \"Our hearts are all going out to Alex's family.\"",
    "Children in Need chair resigns over grants to scandal-hit LGBT charity\n\nRosie Millard accused Children in Need of \"institutional failure\"\n\nThe chair of the BBC's Children in Need charity has resigned, after reports that she protested over grants awarded to an LGBT youth charity, whose former chief had previously been involved in a child abuse scandal. Rosie Millard, a writer and broadcaster, accused the charity of \"institutional failure\" in her letter of resignation shared with the Times., external Millard objected to \u00a3466,000 being awarded to LGBT Youth Scotland (LGBTYS) , a charity which supports young gay and transgender people. Its former chief James Rennie was convicted in 2009 of child sex assaults. The grants from Children In Need began seven months later, when the charity had new management in place.\n\nBBC News has not seen Millard's resignation letter. A Children in Need spokesman said: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of all children and young people. \"When allegations were made in relation to LGBT Youth Scotland their grant was immediately suspended with the full support of the board and a review began. In order to do this thoroughly and fairly the review took three months and culminated in the decision to withdraw funding.\" Rennie, who had been chief executive of LGBTYS from 2003 to 2008 and is also a previous SNP adviser, was jailed in 2009 after being revealed as a member of a paedophile ring. He was given a life sentence for sexually assaulting a three-month-old child and for conspiring to get access to children in order to abuse them. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 13 years, later reduced to eight on appeal. Rennie's crimes were found to have had no relation to or impact on the charity and were only uncovered by a police investigation. LGBTYS cut ties with him immediately and have said they \"condemn any actions which harm children and young people\". Children in Need suspended grants to the charity in May 2024, after Millard says she alerted them to his case. It withdrew funding around three months later following a review. However, Millard, who used to be an arts correspondent for BBC News, criticised Children in Need for what she said was a lack of due diligence. She accused chief executive Simon Antrobus of failing to respond \u201cwith the necessary level of seriousness\u201d and hesitating to take action. She alleged that he eventually cut funding to the charity only because of fear of negative publicity. Antrobus, who has been chief executive of Children In Need since 2016 and previously held senior positions at Parkinson's UK and Scope, has not publicly commented.\n\nAnother man, who contributed to schools guidance put together by LGBT Youth Scotland, was convicted this year of sharing indecent images of children including some of newborn babies. Andrew Easton was a young person who attended services of LGBT Youth Scotland in the 2000s, and, as a result, contributed to a 2010 guide for young people about coming out. However, he was never an employee of the charity. He pleaded guilty in September to \u00adcommunicating online with someone he believed to be a child, downloading indecent images of children and distributing indecent images of children. He was sentenced to a community order, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, put on the sex offenders register for three years and told to take part in a sex offenders programme. In 2022, two men said that they were groomed at LGBTYS around the time Rennie was chief executive. In response, LGBTYS suspended a staff member and referred itself to the police. A Children in Need spokesman said: \"The Children in Need board of trustees are supportive of the actions taken by the CEO and senior leadership team and stand by the decisions made. \"Rosie at all times retained the board\u2019s support. In the wake of her resignation, in order to ensure any lessons learnt are captured, the trustees have instigated a review of ways of working between the board and executive in which Rosie has kindly agreed to participate.\u201d\n\nMhairi Crawford, chief executive of LGBTYS, said that Millard\u2019s resignation letter \u201cdemonstrates the ideologically driven nature of her attacks on our organisation\u201d. Crawford said: \u201cWe are pleased to see confirmation that Children in Need\u2019s investigations into the work of LGBT Youth Scotland found nothing to report. \u201cTime and time again, those with anti-inclusivity motives point to historic allegations in attempts to destroy our reputation. Allegations that have been investigated and cleared by Police Scotland, and proven to have had no link to our work.\u201d Speaking to BBC News on Thursday Crawford added she was \"really gutted\" to have lost funding from Children in Need. \"We worked with them [Children in Need] for the best part of 15 years, and it's really sad to see a funder choosing to take that line,\" she said. \"I understand why they've done it, and I respect it, but it's really sad that it happened, and really disappointing how it reached the press and how it communicated publicly.\" Tim Davie, the BBC's director general, praised Millard on Wednesday for her \u201csignificant impact on countless children\u201d. Children in Need raised more than \u00a339 million in its annual broadcast on Friday.",
    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. We must change the way we measure debt, says Rachel Reeves\n\nThe government will change its self-imposed debt rules in order to free up billions for infrastructure spending, the chancellor has told the BBC. Rachel Reeves said that she would make a technical change to the way debt is measured which will allow it to fund extra investment. She said this was being done \"so that we can grow our economy and bring jobs and growth to Britain\". However, Reeves' first Budget next week is still expected to mean some cuts to public services and tax rises.\n\nThe government has committed to get debt falling as share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, rather than over a rolling five-year period. But the wider debt measure is expected to allow for up to \u00a350bn more borrowing to invest in big building projects such as roads, railways or hospitals, although not all of this is expected to be allocated at the Budget. \"We will be changing the measure of debt,\" Reeves told the BBC, adding that she will set out the details of that on 30 October. She said the Treasury would \"be putting in guard rails\" on investment spending by having the National Audit Office and the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's financial watchdog, \"validating the investments we're making to ensure we deliver that value-for-money\".\n\nReeves added having such oversight would also \"give markets confidence that there are rules around the investments we can make as a country\". But shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the \"consistent advice I received from Treasury officials was always that increasing borrowing meant interest rates would be higher for longer - and punish families with mortgages\". \"The markets are watching,\" he added. However, a Labour spokesperson said the party \"will not take any lectures from the Tories on how to run the economy\" citing former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget which caused market turmoil. The extra room for manoeuvre for spending on investment projects will not be able to be used for extra day-to-day spending, as Reeves has committed to fund that with tax receipts. This means planned taxes will go ahead in the Budget. Speculation is growing over what taxes will be raised next week, with Labour's election manifesto stating the party would not increase taxes on \"working people\", including National Insurance, income tax and VAT. The chancellor has signalled that businesses face an increase in National Insurance, saying the \"working people\" pledge related to the employee element of the tax, as opposed to the sum paid by employers. There has been lack of clarity over how the government defines \"working people\". Later on Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he did not consider someone who works but gets their income from assets as well, such as shares or property, to be a working person. \"They wouldn't come within my definition,\" he said. He separately told reporters a working person is someone who \"works for a living and through that gets their income\". Acknowledging this was a \"very broad\" definition, he elaborated he had in mind someone who earns a living and has savings but who doesn't \"have the ability to sort of routinely write a big cheque if they get into difficulties\".\n\nEarlier Reeves told the BBC it was important for the government to \"get a grip on day-to-day spending\" by making sure it was paid for through tax receipts and by reforming public services to make them more productive. The chancellor said she will commit to a tighter financial rule requiring all day-to-day spending to be funded via tax receipts. That rule \"is the one that really binds, and it's hard to meet, and that will require difficult decisions on spending, welfare and taxation,\" she said. The chancellor said she intended to reverse what she called \"the path of decline\" that she says she has inherited from the previous Conservative administration. She suggested this would have seen a fall in government investment from 2.6% of the share of the economy last year to 1.7% by 2028-29, or \u00a320bn a year in cash terms. \"If we continued on that path, we'd miss out on other opportunities, and other countries would seize them,\" she said. \"We need to invest more to grow our economy and seize the huge opportunities there are in digital, in tech, in life sciences, in clean energy, but we'll only be able to do that if we change the way that we we measure debt,\" she said at a meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC. Sir Keir told the BBC the change to the debt rules showed the \"mindset of the new government\". \"We're going to clear the decks,\u201d he said. \"If you know what the problem is, what the challenge is, every business knows this, every family knows it, run towards it and fix it.\" The Treasury had already signalled that a rule change was likely ahead of the Budget. The chancellor cited top economists as backing the move, including both the former governor and chief economist of the Bank of England, Mark Carney and Andrew Haldane, as well as former Conservative Treasury minister Jim O\u2019Neill. She also referred to the words of a top IMF official overnight. The organisation's first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath backed greater investment, speaking to the BBC: \"I just want to emphasize again, that public investment is needed in the UK. \"If you compare the UK to G7 countries, investment has fallen short, and so that spending will have to take place alongside having the kind of rules that stabilizes debt over the next five years.\" But writing in The Times newspaper last week, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said that using a broader debt measure called public sector net financial liabilities could have downsides, including potentially spooking financial markets, which fund the government's borrowing.\n\nWhat do you want to see in the Budget, how do you think it will affect you personally and what would you like us to explain?",

    "Cyclists on phones face jail under Japan\u2019s new laws\n\nThe number of cyclists in Japan surged during the pandemic, and authorities are now racing to regulate them.\n\nCyclists using a mobile phone while riding in Japan could face up to six months jail under strict new rules introduced Friday. Those who breach the revised road traffic law can be punished with a maximum sentence of six months in prison, or a fine of 100,000 yen ($655; \u00a3508). The number of accidents involving cyclists started climbing in 2021, as more people opted to cycle instead of using public transport during the pandemic, according to local media. Authorities are now racing to regulate riders. Besides cracking down on phone usage, the new rules also target cyclists riding under the influence of alcohol, with a penalty of up to three years in prison or a fine of 500,000 yen ($3,278; \u00a32,541).\n\nHours after the new laws came into effect, Osaka authorities confirmed on Friday that they had already recorded five violations, including two men who were caught riding bicycles while drunk. One of the men had collided with another cyclist, but no injuries were reported. Under the new rules, cyclists who cause accidents can be fined up to 300,000 yen ($2,000; \u00a31,500 ) or jailed up to a year. The total number of traffic accidents across Japan may be declining, but bicycle accidents are on the rise. More than 72,000 bicycle accidents were recorded in Japan in 2023, accounting for over 20% of all traffic accidents in the country, according to local media. In the first half of 2024 there was one fatality and 17 serious injuries from accidents involving cyclists using their phones \u2014 the highest number since the police started recording such statistics in 2007. Between 2018 and 2022 there were 454 accidents caused by cyclists using phones, according to police \u2014 a 50% increase from the previous five-year period. The latest rules come amid a series of safety regulations aimed at protecting the safety of riders and pedestrians. Last year, authorities made it compulsory for cyclists to wear helmets. In May, Japan\u2019s parliament passed a bill allowing police to fine cyclists for traffic violations. Unlike in many other countries, cycling on pavements is legal in Japan, and is a common practice.",
    "A poignant memorial to polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton from his crew has gone on display in Dundee after a journey of more than 7,000 miles from the South Atlantic. Shackleton died in 1922 in South Georgia during his final expedition. The Hope Cross was constructed by crew members who could not attend his funeral. The 3m (9.84ft) memorial is now on display beside RRS Discovery, the ship which first took Shackleton to Antarctica in 1901. Its unveiling coincides with the release of a new documentary on Shackleton's doomed Endurance expedition and the 2022 hunt for the sunken vessel.\n\nThe crew of The Quest pictured with the cross the month after Shackleton's death in 1922\n\nThe wooden cross stood for almost 100 years at King Edward Point, South Georgia, near Grytviken, before it was replaced with a replica in 2018 to preserve the original memorial from the elements. The original cross weighs about 30kg (66lb) and was made with salvaged wood from a whaling station. It was painted white to protect the wood, but decades of Antarctic weather have returned it to its natural state.\n\nShackleton's granddaughter Alexandra said she was \"delighted\" to see the cross in its new home\n\nDundee Heritage Trust heritage manager Sophie Hinde said: \"The Quest crew members had to leave Ernest behind when he passed away to continue on the rest of the expedition. \"There were thoughts that his body would be taken to England for a funeral, but it was actually buried in Grytviken and the crew put up the cross because they wanted him to be memorialized.\"\n\nThe cross was stored in a crate ahead of its journey to Dundee\n\nIts remote location meant few people were previously able to visit the memorial. \"If you wanted to go down to South Georgia, the only way to do it is on a cruise ship. There aren't that many, and the season is quite short,\" said Ms Hinde \"We were approached by the South Georgia Heritage Trust, who had the cross in a warehouse after it was taken down in 2018 for conservation reasons. \"They just wanted to give people the space to see it.\" The cross was taken on a three-month journey on the RRS David Attenborough from Grytviken to Harwich, before being briefly stored at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. Ms Hinde said: \"Then we went down in a van and collected it, so it's been quite a journey. \"It was actually in a very good condition.\"\n\nThe cross stood at King Edward Point, South Georgia, for almost a century\n\nInterest in Shackleton's adventures remains high more than a century after his death. Ms Hinde said: \"I think a lot of people appreciate his spirit of adventure. \"He's probably best known for his Endurance expedition, where he rescued his crew after their ship had sunk in the Antarctic winter. \"His leadership is a thing that people come back to again and again - the adventures that he went on are incredible.\"\n\nSir Ernest Shackleton died on board his ship The Quest in January 1922\n\nErnest Shackleton was born in County Kildare, Ireland, in 1874. In 1901, alongside explorer Robert Falcon Scott, he got closer to the South Pole than any other European explorer. Shackleton's most famous mission was his plan to cross the South Pole on board his ship The Endurance. In 1915, the boat became trapped in ice, and his crew abandoned ship, crossing onto floating ice, where they decided they were going to live until they could be saved. In April 1916, Shackleton took five crew members in a small boat in search of help for the others, where they travelled 807 miles (1,300km) of ocean before reaching the island of South Georgia. The last voyage Ernest Shackleton took was on board the Quest in 1922. He had planned to explore Alaska and islands nearby, but lost his funding. Instead, he headed to the South Pole to explore islands around Antarctica but died of a heart attack on board the ship, aged 47.\n\nSophie Hinde said very few people had previously seen the cross in person, due to its remote location.\n\nThe Hope Cross is on long-term loan from the South Georgia Museum. Ms Hinde said: \"Antarctica from 1901 to 1904 is the main expedition that we talk about here. \"But actually, the early age of Antarctic exploration ran right until this last expedition, the Quest in 1922, so it rounds off the stories that we tell her quite nicely.\" Shackleton\u2019s granddaughter Alexandra will attend a private rededication ceremony to the cross later. She said: \u201cI am absolutely delighted to see the cross here in a city that my grandfather knew so well. \"Our family is very grateful to all who have made this possible.\u201d",
    "'This town is where goths feel safe and accepted'\n\nWhitby was chosen as the festival's host town due to its association with Dracula\n\nThirty years since the seaside town hosted its first Goth Weekend, Whitby is still a \"safe and accepting\" place, say regular visitors to the festival. Held annually in April and October, the gothic gathering began in 1994 and now attracts large crowds to Whitby's cobbled streets. Inspired by the town's association with Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, it started out as a one-off meeting of pen-friends in The Elsinore pub. This year\u2019s celebrations will take place from 1 November and include live music and stalls, with a 30th birthday party planned for 3 November.\n\nElaine Horton, owner of goth shop Pandemonium, said her business would not exist without the boost in trade from the two weekends. Her alternative store sells clothing, shoes, babywear, hair accessories, jewellery and gifts and first opened in 1999. Ms Horton said there was a large variation within the subculture. \"Believe it or not there are probably around 35 types of goth,\" she said. \"There are a lot of people who come into Whitby just for the architecture, they come to Goth Weekend because they like the clothing, they like the music, some people like all of it,\" she added.\n\nThe Sophie Lancaster Foundation said Whitby felt like a \u201csecond home\u201d\n\nMembers of The Sophie Lancaster Foundation charity have been attending Whitby Goth Weekend since the 20-year-old was killed in 2007. She died after a group of boys attacked her and her boyfriend in a park in Lancashire while they were dressed in gothic clothing. Two of them were convicted of murder. The foundation has a stall at the festival to raise money for its work, educate people and keep her memory alive. Elloise Dickinson, education and engagement manager, said the event was a \u201cspecial place for the foundation\u201d. \u201cThe Whitby goths have always been there for us,\" she said. \u201cWe meet people who would see Sophie in Manchester or know people who knew her and even those who don\u2019t come up and say: \u2018We resonate with her story.\u2019 \u201d Ms Dickinson said the town felt like a \u201csecond home\u201d for the foundation. \u201cOur heart is there,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a place like Whitby there\u2019s so much support. \u201cThe festival gives a chance for alternative people to come out in finery and express themselves and feel safe. \u201cIt\u2019s important for others to see alternative people look so amazing in a way they feel comfortable. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people as old as 80 or 90 but also children as young as four or five who are just getting into it. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to celebrate difference in culture and celebrate diversity.\u201d\n\n\"Dr Crank\", who runs Whitby Walks, says the weekend had become a \"worldwide event\"\n\n\"Dr Crank\", who runs ghost walks, said he had watched the goth festival grow into a \"worldwide event\". \u201cThe reason the goths like to come to Whitby, especially this time of the year, is it\u2019s atmospheric,\" he said. Dr Crank, who also holds Halloween walks and a Dracula-themed tour, added: \u201cYou get goths from all over the world coming to Whitby, we welcome them all. \u201cWhitby\u2019s a very accepting town and every year they bring colour \u2013 mainly black or purple.\"\n\nThe festival is held twice a year and welcomes visitors from around the world\n\nMerryn Wilderspin, an artist and designer from Malton, has created two Whitby Goth Weekend collections of her made-to-order designer bags. She said: \u201cI thought Whitby\u2019s goth and steampunk activities could make for interesting themes.\" Despite admitting she \u201ccan\u2019t falsely claim to be a die-hard goth\u201d, she said the weekend had a \u201cfun atmosphere\u201d and she loved being part of it. She said: \u201cGoth is so much to do with fashion and music, which are natural parts of my life. \u201cWith the collections, I thought people would like to have something they can use in an everyday sense that offers a goth flavour without it being too obvious.\u201d\n\nWhitby was chosen for the event because of its association with Dracula",

    "Jacques Billant said some people were rescued from the water but others were likely trampled to death in the boat\n\nFour people, including a two-year-old boy, have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, French authorities say. The authorities said they were found \"unconscious\" and were likely \"trampled to death\" in two separate boats that had engine failures. French interior minister Bruno Retailleau called the deaths a \"terrible tragedy\", adding that people smugglers \"have the blood of these people on their hands\". In one of the incidents, a French rescue service picked up 15 people, including the boy, and one person was airlifted to a French hospital with burns to their legs.\n\nThe prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, Jacques Billant, said one of the boats was off the coast of Boulogne-Sur-Mer in northern France which was carrying \"almost 90 people\" overnight. He said it got into difficulty after an engine failure and called French rescue services. \"A French rescue boat went to the scene and picked up 15 migrants, including an unconscious child. \"The medical team dispatched by helicopter was unable to save the two-year-old child, who was pronounced dead.\" According to the Boulogne-Sur-Mer prosecutor Guirec Le Bras, the young boy, who he said was born in Germany to a Somali mother, was \u201ctrampled to death\u201d. A person on the vessel with burns to their legs was airlifted to hospital, Billant added. The remaining passengers on the boat continued their journey, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nOn a separate overcrowded small boat, another incident happened overnight off the coast of Calais when \u201cmultiple engine failures led to a stampede and some migrants fell into the water but were rescued\u201d, Billant told journalists. \u201cThree people \u2013 two men and a woman \u2013 were then discovered unconscious inside this small boat,\u201d he added. Billant said they were all about 30 years old. \u201cThey were likely trampled to death during the stampede,\" Billant said. A statement by the French coastguard said 71 people were recovered on board, including the three people found unconscious. An investigation has been opened by the Boulogne-sur-Mer public prosecutor's office, the coastguard added. According to French authorities, 51 migrants have lost their lives this year while trying to cross the Channel to reach the UK. \"Our government will intensify the fight against these mafias who are getting rich by organising these crossings of death,\" Retailleau said in a post on X. UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, also posting on X, described the deaths as \"appalling\", adding that \"criminal smuggler gangs continue to organise these dangerous boat crossings\". \"The gangs do not care if people live or die - this is a terrible trade in lives,\" she said. She said she had been in touch with Retailleau on Saturday, and they had met in Italy at the G7 meeting earlier this week, where they had discussed the matter. She previously said that an action plan agreed at that meeting \"means new international joint investigative teams to pursue the gangs, finance and supply chains.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the country's prime minister, Michel Barnier, said France needed a stricter immigration policy. Barnier said he would be \"ruthless\" with people traffickers, adding that they \"exploit misery and despair\" and encourage undocumented asylum seekers to cross the Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously said he was \"absolutely determined\" to tackle the smuggling gangs facilitating the crossings but did not put a timeframe on that. Figures from the Home Office show there were 395 migrants on 4 October who arrived in the UK in small boats without permission to enter the country, and 59 arrived on 29 September. More than 25,000 people have crossed the Channel in 2024 so far. At least 194 migrants died attempting to cross the English Channel between 2018 and September 2024, according to estimates from the International Organization for Migration, which is part of the UN.",
    "Funeral held for toddler who died in Dungannon\n\nTavia Da Costa was due to turn two years old later this month\n\nThe funeral for Tavia Da Costa, who was due to turn two later this month, has taken place in Dungannon after she died at a house in Windmill Court in the town last Sunday. Hundreds attended the service at St Patrick's church in the County Tyrone town. On Saturday evening, a crowd of about 400 people gathered for a candlelit vigil organised by the Lisnahull Residents Group. Three people appeared in court in Belfast on Thursday charged in connection with her death.\n\nThe vigil on Saturday night was organised by the Lisnahull Residents Group\n\nA tin whistle was played at the start of the vigil and prayers were said, members from the East Timor community and local councillors also spoke briefly.\n\nIndependent Mid Ulster councillor Barry Monteith was one of the organisers of the vigil on Saturday. \u201cFor a crowd to turn out like this at such short notice, it shows the real Dungannon and that we\u2019re a community united in grief,\" he said. \u201cThere are people here from far and wide to put their arms round each other and support each other to find away through this.\n\nBarry Monteith said people had attended from \"far and wide\"\n\n\u201cBecause people have just been shocked and horrified after what happened, so it was important to come together tonight.\u201d\n\nRoy Setiawan, chair of the Timorese Association Inclusive Support, said people had attended the vigil to show their support\n\nRoy Setiawan, chair of the Timorese Association Inclusive Support, said the community was \u201cheartbroken\u201d. \u201cAs a community this has really touched us from the Lisnahull Community Association and we appreciate what have they have done, because it feels like everybody\u2019s loss,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to come together tonight commemorate and remember little Tavia, because we\u2019re all feeling the loss, but a lot of people are here to support her and her family.\u201d",
    "Satirical news publication The Onion has bought Infowars, the media organisation headed by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for an undisclosed price at a court-ordered auction. The Onion said that the bid was secured with the backing of families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, who won a $1.5bn (\u00a31.18bn) defamation lawsuit against Jones for spreading false rumours about the massacre. A judge in Texas ordered the auction in September, and various groups \u2013 both Jones\u2019s allies and detractors \u2013 had suggested they would bid for the company. Jones founded Infowars in 1999. He has vowed to continue broadcasting using a different platform.\n\nIn a rambling video message posted on Thursday morning, Jones called the takeover a \u201ctotal attack on free speech\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen but I\u2019m going to be here until they come in and turn the lights off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the tyranny of the New World Order, desperate to silence the American people, the mandate of Trump against all the lawfare \u2013 they don\u2019t care.\u201d The Onion plans to rebuild the website and feature well-known internet humour writers and content creators. \u201cWe are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website,\u201d said Ben Collins, a former NBC News journalist who is chief executive of The Onion\u2019s parent company, in a statement. The website also posted a jokey article, saying that Infowars \u201chas shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society\". The article went on to say that the satirical publication \u201chas outwitted the hapless owner of InfoWars\" and \u201cforced him to sell it at a steep bargain: less than one trillion dollars\". A lawyer for families of eight of the Sandy Hook victims said the bid had their support. \u201cBy divesting Jones of Infowars\u2019 assets, the families and the team at The Onion have done a public service and will meaningfully hinder Jones\u2019 ability to do more harm,\u201d lawyer Chris Mattei said in a statement. Robbie Parker, whose daughter Emilie died in the Sandy Hook attack, said: \u201cThe world needs to see that having a platform does not mean you are above accountability \u2013 the dissolution of Alex Jones\u2019 assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for.\u201d Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control not-for-profit organisation, said it had reached an agreement to advertise on the new site.\n\nJones was a fringe figure broadcasting in Austin, Texas in the 1990s and later built an audience of millions with a mix of opinion, speculation and outright fabrication. The company makes most of its money through an online shop selling vitamins and other products. Over time Infowars was increasingly embraced by Donald Trump\u2019s allies and his supporters. During his first run for president, Trump appeared on Infowars and told Jones: \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d The company\u2019s \u2013 and Jones\u2019s \u2013 financial difficulties stem from broadcasts made after the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Twenty young children and six school staff were killed in the attack. After the killings, Jones and guests on his broadcasts repeatedly called into question whether the massacre actually occurred, floating conspiracy theories about whether the murders were faked or carried out by government agents. At one point Jones called the attack \u201ca giant hoax\u201d and in 2015 he said: \"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured\u2026 I knew they had actors there clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors.\" Believers in the web of conspiracy theories that Jones spun harassed the families of the Sandy Hook victims, in some cases sending them pictures of their dead children or of gravestones and posting their personal information online. Some travelled to Newtown to \u201cinvestigate\u201d, and several people have been arrested in connection with harassment of the victims. Jones later acknowledged that the killings were real and insisted his statements were covered by US free speech protections. But relatives of the victims won defamation judgements against Jones and his company over his false statements. He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones\u2019s personal assets. This included a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns, in all totalling around $8.6m according to a court filing.",
    "Poorer patients missing surgery as they 'can't afford time off work'\n\nChief executive of the Western Trust Neil Guckian said it was a \"sad indictment of our society\"\n\nPatients from poorer backgrounds are missing hospital operations because they can't afford to take time off work, a leading health chief has said. Neil Guckian, chief executive of the Western Trust, described it as \"an indictment on society\". Giving evidence to the Stormont health committee, he said Do Not Attends (DNAs) were a major issue for the health service. People \"are foregoing their operation at the expense of maintaining their livelihood\", according to the chief executive.\n\nMr Guckian said he initially thought patient absence was due to people having to travel for appointments, but having done audits and phoned patients, he was told this was not the reason. \"I believe it is linked to social deprivation. People do not want to admit that they can't take days off work,\" he told the committee. \"That is a sad indictment of our society, so we have to have wraparound support to that.\" Mr Guckian also said that because patients were often waiting so long for a procedure, by the time they are seen their condition had deteriorated. That was one of the issues which the trust was dealing with through \"mega clinic\" sessions, aimed at ensuring patients were dealt with in a quicker way, he said. \"They might be a day case, but they need an in-patient clinic because they have actually deteriorated during the course of their waiting list.\" The chief executives of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts gave an update to the Stormont committee on Thursday. Mr Guckian said the health service could not afford to see industrial action because of the current dispute over pay reviews. He added pay levels for all healthcare workers needed to be addressed as the health service was haemorrhaging staff across the border into hospitals in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster on Friday, chair of the Stormont Health Committee, Liz Kimmins, said that the evidence was deeply concerning. \"We need to understand why this is happening and what can be done to ensure that everyone can attend appointments, taking the time off work for something that is important to their health,\" she stated. \"There needs to be a follow up with patients who don't attend as to why this is the case. \"The Department of Health are working hard to tackle waiting lists but there's more work to be done as there will be other patients on the waiting lists who will happily take their space, even if it is last minute,\" she added.",

    "Republicans have retaken control of the US Senate, after flipping seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana. The results guarantee the Republicans at least 52 out of 100 seats in the new chamber, with a handful of races still undecided. Jim Justice, West Virginia's current governor, won the seat vacated by former Democrat Joe Manchin, while Bernie Moreno in Ohio unseated Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown. In Montana, Democratic veteran Jon Tester lost to Republican Tim Sheehy. In the House of Representatives, Republicans so far are leading - though results are still expected from a number of races.\n\nYou need a modern browser with javascript enabled to view the interactive content in this page.\n\nIf the Republican Party controls the House, Senate and the White House, it would have broad power to pass laws and enact the president's partisan agenda. Republicans last won a majority in the Senate in 2018.\n\nIn Ohio, Brown was projected to lose to Moreno, a Colombian immigrant and former car sales magnate who portrayed the veteran politician as \"too liberal for Ohio\". The contest was called the most expensive Senate race in US history. Brown told supporters that the result was a \"disappointment but not a failure\", adding: \"I'm not giving up on our fight for workers and I know you won't either.\" The seat in West Virginia is projected to flip Republican. It was contested after the retirement of Manchin, who frequently clashed with members of his own party before turning independent. Justice had himself been a Democrat before switching parties to the Republicans at a Trump rally in 2017. In Montana, former Navy seal and businessman Sheehy was projected to defeat 18-year incumbent Tester, who was the last remaining Democrat holding statewide office there. The Republican majority could yet increase further as close races in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada are decided.\n\nJim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, won an open seat away from Democrats\n\nA total of 34 Senate seats were being contested on Tuesday. In Texas, Trump ally Ted Cruz fended off a robust challenge from former NFL player Colin Allred to win a third term. Democrats launched a concerted effort to beat Cruz, but the party has not won a state-wide election in Texas for more than 30 years. Republicans also retained Nebraska's seat for incumbent Deb Fischer, after a surprisingly fierce challenge from auto mechanic Dan Osborn, a registered independent. The Senate result immediately kicked off discussions about who would replace Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader, and therefore become majority leader, in the next legislative session. McConnell, 82, announced earlier this year that he was stepping down from the powerful role.\n\nOne possible candidate is Rick Scott, a Republican incumbent in Florida, who retained his seat despite a challenge by former Miami-area Rep Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who migrated from Ecuador as a child. Speaking at a victory rally early Tuesday evening, Scott correctly predicted that Republicans would seize the majority in the Senate, adding that he would be selected as Senate majority leader. \"Florida is the centre of the Republican Party of this country,\" he told the crowd. \"Washington can learn a hell of a lot from what we've done right here in this great state.\"\n\nDemocrats held a seat in Delaware, a state that President Joe Biden represented as a senator for 36 years, with a victory for fourth-term Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. In Maryland, the Democrats retained a seat vacated by Ben Cardin, with Angela Alsobrooks beating the popular Republican Governor Larry Hogan. They will become the first black female senators to represent their respective states. In New Jersey, Democrats retained a seat that was vacated by Bob Menendez, who resigned after he was found guilty of accepting bribes for political favours. Andy Kim, 42, will become the first ever Korean-American senator. In California, Rep Adam Schiff, who led the first of two impeachment investigations against Trump, retained a seat held by late Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein. Both parties are also vying for control of the House, although the balance of power there will not be known for several days. The vast majority of House elections are happening in \"safe districts\" - regions where one party is nearly certain to win. But a handful of other races in swing districts could determine who controls Washington DC. House races that could swing the balance are taking place a wide variety of states, with closely watched elections happening in California, New York, Washington, Maine and Alaska.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

However, despite Smith's creativity in attack and accuracy from the kicking tee, England are still on their worst run since 2018 after five straight defeats. \"I have found Marcus really open to discussions about the game,\" Strawbridge told BBC Sport. \"He is getting better and better at having a deeper understanding of the game and his role in it.\" Since his Premiership debut for Harlequins as an 18-year-old, regular eye-catching performances left many calling for Smith to be England's long-term option at fly-half. Now capped 38 times, he has started six Tests in a row for the first time since 2022, but five have resulted in defeats - four of which came down to the final play. England's opening try on Saturday against South Africa came when Smith opted against a drop-goal, darted to the blindside and set up Ollie Sleightholme for a run into the corner. Strawbridge says that England's attack allows for such improvisation, and is also confident Smith's game management is improving. \"In some environments I have been in we put all the pressure on the 10 like a quarterback in American Football - they make all the decisions, the calls and the plays. That isn't the case here,\" he added. \"We are spreading the decision-making and we are trying to sharpen that edge. Marcus' decisions are within that structure.\"\n\nStrawbridge joined England's coaching set-up on a full-time basis in April after spending four weeks in the camp as a consultant during the Six Nations\n\nThe last time England lost five straight games was under Eddie Jones, who returns to his former employers on Sunday as Japan boss. Having defeated Jones' side - in their most recent victory by 35 points in June - England go in as heavy favourites to end their miserable run. \"We have had growth this campaign,\" Strawbridge added. \"I get people from the outside finding that hard to believe, but this is a further opptortunity for us consolidate some of our practices in seeing things and executing things. \"This is a step, not a launching pad or a saving grace, in the development of a good, good Test team.\"",
    "Senior doctor 'appalled' at state of new kids' cancer ward - inquiry\n\nA senior doctor has told an inquiry she was \u201cappalled\u201d at the state of child cancer wards when a new \u00a3870m hospital opened in Glasgow in 2015. In evidence presented to the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry, infection control doctor Teresa Inkster said she felt \"something had gone horribly wrong\u201d. Dr Inkster was the lead infection control doctor for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde from April 2016 to September 2019. During that time the children's cancer wards were forced to close because of a spike in unusual infections.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating the construction of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) campus in Glasgow, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children. It was set up after a number of patient deaths including that of 10-year-old cancer patient Milly Main. Dr Inkster led the investigation into two cases of cryptococcus in 2019, a fungal infection associated with pigeons droppings. Two patients died after contracting the fungal infection while being treated at the hospital. In written evidence to the inquiry, Dr Inkster said on a walk round of the wards at the Royal Hospital for Children in July 2015 she found \u201choles in the ceiling\u201d, \u201cdust falling on her head\u201d with \u201cworkman drilling holes with the most immunocompromised children present\u201d. Dr Inkster said: \u201cIn my view, something had gone horribly wrong\u201d. She told the inquiry there had been issues with water damage, external and ventilation systems being \"poorly managed\". \"People don't understand the need to remove all of the mouldy material, they may just focus on the tile that the water is dripping from, they don't do full inspections of the ceiling void,\" she said. \"The material that is left is a perfect atmosphere for mould to grow.\" There were not \"sufficient accommodations\" for children with compromised immune systems Dr Inkster argued, adding that whole wards could have been \"protective environments\", not just the isolation rooms for the most vulnerable patients. \"I observed myself that it was very difficult for children to be confined to a room for the length of time they needed to be for bone marrow transplant, and I did see patients on occasion being let out of the room and into the corridor,\" she said. \"I can understand why.\"\n\nDr Inkster took over the role of lead infection control doctor after the resignation of her boss Prof Craig Williams in April 2016. In his evidence to the inquiry last month he denied allegations of bullying, saying other doctors had tried to undermine his position. Dr Inkster, however, described working in \u201can environment of suppression and fear\u201d where she was told by Prof Williams not to write things down. She said she and another infection control doctor (ICD), Christine Peters, had expressed concerns about what they were seeing in both the children and adults hospital. But the doctor, who joined the health board's infection prevention and control team as a consultant microbiologist in 2009, said they were not taken seriously. \u201cI felt that myself and Dr Peters were being labelled as difficult and risk averse,\" she wrote in her 391-page evidence submission. \"And that, that was all there was to see here, that it was personality issues rather than any actual genuine concern that there were patient safety issues about the issues we were addressing.\u201d In her statement, Dr Inkster also said by the autumn of 2015 it was \u201cclear that, at this point, there was an awareness by very senior staff that there were issues and there were meetings taking place.\u201d\n\nShe told senior counsel to the inquiry Fred Mackintosh KC that she had asked for water to start being tested at the hospital as early as 2015, but this idea was initially rejected. \"I faced resistance initially with that because, at the time, Health Protection Scotland had released the national pseudomonas [bacterium that can cause infections in multiple parts of the body] guidance and it did not recommend water testing,\" Dr Inkster said. \"It was different from the guidance in NHS England and Wales at the time.\" She pointed out that there were \"structural abnormalities\" in ward drains which allowed stagnation of the water, and nurses had reported \"black muck refluxing from the drains back into the sink\". This had been made worse by fitting filters in the taps. A 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman died after contracting a cryptococcus infection, linked to pigeon droppings, while being treated at the hospital. The inquiry heard that three other patients had tested positive for the infection. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde does not accept that three of the cases are associated with the hospital, nor that there was any causal link between cryptococcus neoformans infections and the presence of pigeon excrement at the hospital. An NHSGGC spokesperson added: \"The current Scottish Hospitals Inquiry hearings have yet to hear from various key staff. \"A number of NHSGGC staff will be able to provide evidence to respond to these issues and will endeavour to support the inquiry to fully establish the facts.\"",
    "Bolt drivers win right to holiday and minimum wage\n\nThousands of drivers working for ride-hailing and food delivery app Bolt have won a legal claim to be classed as workers in the UK rather than self-employed. The ruling means drivers could be entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage, which lawyers said could lead to compensation worth more than \u00a3200m. Bolt said it was reviewing its options, including grounds for appeal. It pointed out that the findings of the Employment Tribunal were confined to drivers who were not on multiple ride-hailing apps.\n\nAbout 15,000 current and former Bolt drivers took legal action against the Estonian-headquartered firm at a London employment tribunal. They argued they were formally workers under British law. Bolt said it had \"always supported\" the \"choice\" of drivers \"to remain self-employed independent contractors\". But the tribunal found that \"overwhelmingly, the power lies with Bolt\". \"There is nothing in the relationship which demands, or even suggests, agency\" on the part of the drivers, it said. The tribunal added that \"the supposed contract between the Bolt driver and the passenger is a fiction designed by Bolt \u2013 and in particular its lawyers \u2013 to defeat the argument that it has an employer/worker relationship with the driver\".\n\u2022 None Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage\n\nThe ruling is the latest on the \"gig-economy\", which is characterised by flexible but unpredictable work patterns. Leigh Day, the law firm representing the claimants, said the judgment confirmed \"gig economy operators cannot continue to falsely classify their workers as independent contractors... to avoid providing the rights those workers are properly entitled to\". It called on Bolt to compensate its clients \"without further delay\". Leigh Day said the ruling \"affects all of the 100,000-plus drivers who take on work through the Bolt private hire hailing app\". But Bolt said the Employee Tribunal's findings were limited to drivers who are not \"multi-apping\". The company said nine in 10 Bolt drivers use multiple apps to connect to customers. The legal case follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2021 that Uber drivers were not self-employed, but were workers entitled to rights including holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and breaks.\n\nThe GMB union said the Bolt ruling \"goes further than the landmark case against Uber\". Uber agreed to recognise the GMB in 2021 following the ruling. The Bolt judgement \"raises questions for the industry around waiting time and multi-apping,\" said Eamon O\u2019Hearn, GMB national officer. \"We believe workers rights around holidays should be universal and this ruling confirms that fact.\" He added the union would \"review the decision closely and engage with the industry to understand the implications for our members\u201d.",
    "Free shots and beer buckets in party town at centre of suspected methanol deaths\n\nHolly Bowles, left, was confirmed to have died on Friday, a day after British lawyer Simone White and Australian Bianca Jones\n\nFor Australian friends Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, it was their first big trip venturing out to explore the world. Like so many 19-year-olds, they were drawn to the romance of backpacking across South East Asia - where food is great, people are friendly and the scenery stunning. They had \u201csaved up enough money after school and university to have their overseas jaunt, as so many of our kids do,\u201d said their football team coach Nick Heath. \u201cAnd off they went.\u201d They ended up on 12 November in the riverside town of Vang Vieng in central Laos. The two checked into the popular Nana Backpacker Hostel - where guests often receive a free shot upon arrival. Days later both were on life support in hospitals in Thailand. Jones\u2019s death was announced on 21 November, and Bowles\u2019s a day later. The death of a British woman, 28-year-old Simone White, was also announced on Thursday. They are among six foreign tourists who have died from what is believed to be a mass incident of methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng.\n\nTwo Danish women, aged 19 and 20, died last week, while an American man also died. They have not been identified. It is unclear how many others have fallen ill, but a transnational police investigation is now underway into the deaths. Much of the scrutiny has fallen on the hostel where some of the victims were reportedly staying. The girls had taken free shots there before heading out for the night. The hostel manager has denied culpability, saying the same drinks had been served to at least 100 other guests that night who reported no problems. The manager was taken in by police for questioning on Thursday. Mr Heath, who spoke to media on behalf of Ms Bowles\u2019s family, said they knew it was methanol that caused the girls to fall ill. But \u201cno one really knows how and where it entered their system\u201d. To understand what happened, the BBC spoke to backpackers and a diplomat about the area. Our reporting found the town where travellers fell ill remains a party hotspot despite past efforts, with some success, to clean up its image, and that while the risk of methanol poisoning is known among consulates and tourism operators, travellers appear largely ignorant.\n\nVang Vieng - a tiny town on the Nam Song river surrounded by limestone mountains and paddy fields - is known for its scenery. It is also known as a party town - a reputation Laos officials have been trying to shed over the past decade. A four-hour bus ride from the capital Vientiane, it has long been the stopping point on the Banana Pancake Trail backpacking route between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam before heading north to the ancient temples of Luang Prabang. In Vang Vieng, hostel bunks are advertised at less than \u20ac10 (\u00a38) a night, while a bucket of beer can cost half that. Drugs like marijuana and mushrooms are in ready supply, openly advertised at cafes and diners. During the early 2000s and 2010s the town was famous for hardcore partying and as a spot for riding inflatables down the local river. But after several tourists were injured or died, efforts were made at raising safety standards. \u201cTo combat the river tubing deaths they demolished a bunch of the riverside bars that were selling buckets of vodka to people floating by,\u201d one Western diplomat in the region told the BBC.\n\nVang Vieng in Laos are popular with backpackers travelling through South East Asia\n\nLaos officials aimed to re-centre the town as a spot for eco-tourism rather than just a hub for the young and drunk. \u201cAnd it worked,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019s actually changed a quite a lot in the past decade, they\u2019ve cleaned it up, it\u2019s way more modern than it used to be.\" But because of that: \u201cI think it can be very easy for young travellers to miss that this is still a very poor country with lax regulations and safety standards.\u201d The diplomat said methanol poisoning - where alcoholic drinks are contaminated with a toxic compound - is well-known among consulates and tourism operators. Consulates are fairly regularly having to deal with cases of tourists who have fallen ill from dodgy drinks, the diplomat noted. South East Asia is documented as the worst region for methanol poisoning. Local producers making cheap alcohol often will not correctly reduce the toxic level of methanol produced in the process. Thousands of incidents are recorded every year in the region,, external according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). But for tourists, awareness around poisonous alcohol is low. British backpacker Sarisha told the BBC's Newsbeat programme that people did not seem to consider the risks of free drinks when she was recently staying at Nana Backpacker. Like most other hostels, happy hours were a daily staple at the venue as well as free shots of local vodkas as courtesies, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very party city,\u201d she said.\n\nTourists still in town are now taking extra precautions after the shocking deaths. On Friday, Miika, 19, a Finnish backpacker staying at a hostel just 10 minutes walk from Nana Backpacker, told the BBC he and his friends had arrived in town two days ago. They were now only ordering bottled beers and rethinking river tubing because shots were included. \u201cNow because we know about this, we didn\u2019t really want to go there,\u201d he said. British woman Natasha Moore, 22, told the BBC she cancelled her booking for Nana Backpacker after hearing about the deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s just so scary, I feel so overwhelmed\u2026 it feels like I\u2019ve escaped death, almost like survivor's guilt\", she said in a TikTok video warning other travellers. Her group arrived in the town two days after the poisoning, where \u201cit was still kind of hush hush, nobody really knew too much about what was going on\". She knew many travellers decided to skip the town and said there were signs in the hostel warning to be careful about drinks. She said she \"can't even count how many free drinks\" she had on her travels, but over five nights in Vang Vieng, she and her friends had no free drinks or spirits, only bottled alcohol. \u201cI feel so, so sad and upset for all the friends and family and the people still in hospital. It's just so unfair, we were just trying to have a good time,\" she said. \u201cWe've worked hard to save up to go travel, like it's such a brave thing to do, and then something like that can happen.\u201d",

A heavy defeat by New Zealand saw India's net run-rate plummet, but they still took 18.5 overs to chase just 106 against their rivals. It was a comfortable chase in the end with such little scoreboard pressure, but Fatima Sana's two wickets in two balls in the 16th over, with 26 runs still needed, kept Pakistan in the hunt. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur showed composure with 29 from 24 balls, though she had to retire hurt with two runs required, leaving Sajeevan Sajana to hit the winning runs from her first ball. The nerves had increased because there was such little intent or urgency throughout the modest chase, with the usually aggressive opener Shafali Verma making 32 from 35 balls and Jemimah Rodrigues adding 23 from 28. Bowlers dominated in both innings, with no batter looking particularly comfortable in timing the ball as seamer Arundhati Reddy starred with 3-19 for India. Nida Dar top-scored with 28 from 34 balls for Pakistan but they lost wickets regularly, and failed to put a decent partnership together to put India's bowlers under the pump. In contrast, India managed to keep wickets in hand, which made their approach even more perplexing as they crawled to 25-1 after the six-over powerplay without hitting a boundary. But they are off the mark and though they will be favourites in their next match against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, are still under huge pressure to reach the semi-finals with defending champions Australia still to come in their group. Pakistan are also still in contention but also face a significant challenge as Australia are their next opponents on Friday.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIndia were under significant scrutiny coming into their second match after they were stunned by New Zealand, with all of their matches being essentially must-win because of the fact heavy favourites Australia are also in their group. It may have been gritty and they made hard work of it, but the tournament so far has not favoured a particularly free-flowing style of cricket, with New Zealand's 160 the only total of more than a run a ball so far. Harmanpreet marshalled her bowlers expertly after losing the toss, with leg-spinner Asha Sobhana's two easy dropped chances the only blemish in an otherwise very professional effort. The wickets were shared, with seamer Renuka Singh Thakur removing Gull Feroza in the first over to peg Pakistan back, before Shreyanka Patil, Deepti Sharma and Reddy worked their way through a nervous-looking middle order. The captain could only watch as her openers tentatively prodded their way through the powerplay, with Smriti Mandhana first to fall for seven from 16 balls. And while the total never felt beyond their control, it felt tense and frustrating throughout before Harmanpreet's arrival as the captain decided to set an example, using her feet and running hard between the wickets to finally score at a strike-rate of beyond 100. She was injured while scrambling back into her crease after Muneeba Ali missed a stumping, and seemed to hurt her neck or shoulder, so India will be hoping for a swift recovery because an in-form and confident Harmanpreet, with the added incentive of a point to prove, could go a long way in deciding whether they make it out of the group.\n\nSmriti Mandhana, standing in for captain Harmanpreet Kaur: \"I think it's too soon to say anything [about Harmanpreet]. She's with the medical staff, but hopefully it's not too bad. \"Our bowling team was disciplined, they followed our plans but a better start with the bat would have been nice. We will take momentum from this game.\u201d England bowler Tash Farrant on BBC Test Match Special: \u201cIt was a convincing win for India in the end but a baffling one as well because we thought that, after keeping Pakistan down to that low total of 105, they were going to come out all guns blazing and try to get that total as quickly as they could. \u201cThey have got their first win on the board, but I don't think it will have put much fear into the other teams they are going to face in the group stages.\u201d\n\u2022 None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "Two people died and six were injured in the blast\n\nA second body has been found following an explosion which also killed a seven-year-old boy. The victim, believed to be a man in his 30s, was found in the remains of three houses destroyed on Violet Close in Benwell, Newcastle. The blast, which happened at about 00:45 BST on Wednesday, destroyed six flats along the street. An investigation by emergency services is under way and gas service workers remain at the scene.\n\nFormal identification of both of those who died is yet to take place, Northumbria Police said. Five adults and a child were also taken to hospital with varying degrees of injuries, with all but one discharged following treatment. A man aged in his 30s remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition. Officers also confirmed there were no reports of people related to the properties still missing.\n\nFloral tributes have been left at the scene\n\nCordons around the site are \"expected to be in place for some time\", police said. Supt Darren Adams said the force was \"committed to providing answers to what has happened\". It said housing officers had ensured all those living nearby and who had been evacuated had a place to stay. Some were with friends and family while others were in temporary hotel accommodation. The authority said it was working to secure \"suitable long-term options\".\n\nSeveral community centres in the area have opened their doors to support people affected. The Reverend Chris Minchin of Benwell and Scotswood Team Parish, said people had been making donations, including baby clothes, because a lot of young families had been affected. He said many people caught up in the explosion had to leave their homes in their pyjamas, \"grabbing\" pets as they fled. One of those living nearby, Jodie Holmes, said she was \"just drifting off to sleep\" when she heard a \"boom\". She said: \"We got up and went outside. You could hear the screams, crying.\"\n\nJodie Holmes volunteered at the community centre housing people who had been evacuated\n\nMs Holmes went to volunteer at the nearby community centre which opened \"within minutes\" of the explosion. She said 60 to 70 residents were there overnight. \"Everyone was in shock,\" she said. \"Kids were sleeping under the tables on blankets.\" The Red Cross gave out mobile phone chargers and food at the evacuation centre. Volunteers have since been sorting donation boxes to give to the families affected. Meanwhile, West End Women and Girls Centre also opened up to offer food and a \"warm welcome\".",
    "Workers at Meta have reportedly been sacked for abusing the tech firm's meal voucher system, such as using it to buy toothpaste and washing powder. Other breaches of the policy included sharing the vouchers with others or going over budget, according to people who said they work at Meta. There are differing accounts over how much warning, if any, the owner of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp gave the workers before firing them. Separately, the company has reportedly cut jobs across the business. Meta has been contacted for comment.\n\nMeta staff are given $25 (\u00a319) for lunch, $20 for breakfast, and $25 for dinner in vouchers which are meant to be used for ordering food from Grubhub, the US name for takeaway website Just Eat. Posts on anonymous work social message board Blind appear to confirm elements of the story, originally reported by the Financial Times. One user wrote that more than 30 people were fired last week because they used the credits for \"non-food items, shared credits with people, or went above budget\". Examples of the non-food items bought included toothpaste, toothbrushes and wine glasses. \"They were given a warning to stop which most of them did, but were still fired three months later even after stopping,\" the user said. Some repeated the claim the staff were warned, though other users wrote that there were no warnings. Separately, the company has also reportedly made job cuts at WhatsApp, Instagram and Reality Labs, its virtual reality business responsible for the Oculus headset. These cuts are not related to the issues surrounding the voucher system. Jane Manchun Wong, a former security engineer at Meta, said on Wednesday that she had lost her job as part of these wider layoffs. \"I\u2019m still trying to process this but I\u2019m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Ms Wong was hired just over a year ago as a software engineer after making 2022's Forbes 30 under 30 list. The layoffs were first reported by Verge, with a spokesperson telling the tech publication: \"A few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\"",
    "Paramedics who attended Dawn Sturgess' partner after he fell ill feared he was suffering from nerve agent poisoning, but were overruled by police, an inquiry heard. Ms Sturgess, 44, was inadvertently exposed to the deadly nerve agent Novichok in Amesbury in June 2018. Paramedics told the inquiry they initially misdiagnosed the mother-of-three with opiate-poisoning due to an overlap of symptoms. The inquiry was also told \"more could have been done\" to train staff on \"misdiagnosis awareness\".\n\nBy the time Ms Sturgess' partner Charlie Rowley become ill later that afternoon, paramedics raised concerns this could be nerve agent poisoning, but were effectively \u201coverruled\u201d by Wiltshire Police, the hearing was told. A member of the critical care paramedics, Keith Coomber, told the inquiry he administered naloxone to Ms Sturgess but said he did not notice if it had any effect on her as he was busy. He added if Ms Sturgess had not had an opiate overdose it was \"not going to do anything bad but it\u2019ll help reverse... if it was\". Wayne Darch, who was head of emergency operations at the South Western Ambulance Service in 2018, told the inquiry \"more could have been done\" to train staff on \"misdiagnosis awareness\".\n\nThe inquiry heard the vial carrying the nerve agent contained \"enough poison to kill thousands of people\"\n\nIt is understood the nerve agent had been hidden inside a designer perfume bottle, which Ms Sturgess\u2019 partner unknowingly gave to her. Lead counsel Andrew O\u2019Connor KC told the inquiry she suffered from heart failure because of the Novichok poison. In the end, he adds, the brain injury Ms Sturgess sustained from a lack of oxygen during the initial period was the \"immediate cause\" of her death. The overriding question posed by Mr O\u2019Connor at the inquiry is: \u201cWas the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess preventable?\u201d Mr Darch told the inquiry that poisoning from organophosphates, a toxic chemical compound, can come from several sources including pesticides, fertiliser, and flammable retardants.\n\nMr Darch said his ambulance crews often attended opiate-related overdoses and had confused the overlapping symptoms with nerve agent poisoning\n\nHe added: \u201cA number of our clinicians will go a whole career without witnessing or attending an organophosphate or nerve agent poisoning, whether accidental or deliberate. \u201cWe responded to the symptoms that we believed were of an opiate overdose nature. It was some hours later that it became known this was not an opiate-related incident. \u201cMy perspective is that at the time we did the best we could with what we had available to us.\u201d\n\nJust four months prior to her death, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal had been poisoned with the same nerve agent, roughly eight miles away in Salisbury. The pair had gone for lunch at a pub before they were both found collapsed \"in a serious condition\" on a shopping centre bench. A report at the time stated ambulance staff had similarly misdiagnosed the pair, and the actual cause of their illness was not revealed until \"15 hours later\". Fortunately, both made a full recovery and are currently living under protection.\n\nSkripal and his daughter were suffering from the effects of a toxic chemical, which had been left on the doorknob of his home\n\nMichael Mansfield KC, representing the family of Dawn Sturgess, raised the question of what provisions had been made to protect the public following this initial attack in March. Local emergency workers appear not to have been warned to look out for the fact that symptoms between drug overdoses and nerve agent poisonings can be easily confused - meaning it was not on their immediate radar when Ms Sturgess fell ill. Mr Mansfield also referenced an internal document sent by the Department of Health and Social Care ten days after the Salisbury poisonings, titled 'Risk of Secondary Incident'. It contained a list of the worst-case scenarios, one of which was deemed the \u2018accidental discovery of a discarded agent\u2019 elsewhere. However, the letter was advised \"not to be forwarded further than necessary\", and Mr Darch insists he never saw it.\n\nMr Mansfield said staff and the public should have been made aware after the Salisbury poisonings that there was a potential risk of further harm\n\nMr Mansfield said: \u201cOne of the problems after the Salisbury attack was a mindset, that because Novichok or nerve agent poisoning was rare or virtually unknown, that it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Mr Darch said he was responding on the advice of Public Health experts at the time that the \"risk was extremely low\". Dep Ch Con Paul Mills, also presenting evidence at the inquiry, was the senior Wiltshire Police officer in charge of the Novichok response. He explained: \u201cIt was my understanding at that point in time, that this was an isolated incident. \"That Mr Skripal had been targeted and there was no more information intelligence which indicated there was a wider potential threat for a further attack. \"In hindsight, I think we should have put some advice and guidance out to staff, reaffirming their training and the types of symptoms that may present in a secondary incident,\" he added.\n\nBBC reporter Dan O'Brien has been attending the inquiry at Salisbury Guildhall. \"The afternoon session heard from a paramedic and an emergency responder who both attended to the 999 call Charlie Rowley made when Dawn became unwell after exposure to the nerve agent in the perfume bottle. \"Her heart had stopped - they believed a cardiac arrest linked to a neurological episode. They gave her naloxone, used for drug overdose patients. \"After the Skripal nerve agent poisoning in Salisbury four months earlier, it had been flagged that one could be misdiagnosed as the other - but that had not been communicated to emergency staff. \"They did not see need to use another type of medicine - DuoDote - which all ambulance crews had carried on board since 2017, designed to treat exposure to nerve agents and chemical poisoning like fertilisers. \"No one has criticised the quality of care of these first responders themselves today, but there have been challenging questions for their leaders. \"Communicating the risk of misdiagnoses was not the only issue raised today. \"Worst-case-scenario advice issued at high levels of government warning of the risk to emergency workers and the public of potential further incidents due to the discarding of the material had not been passed on to local ambulance and police bosses.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Wiltshire\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

    "Ministers are giving magistrates new sentencing powers in an effort to ease record delays to criminal trials, despite the fact that they are likely to temporarily push the prison population back up. Magistrates in England and Wales will be able to jail offenders for up to 12 months from November to stop cases clogging up crown courts. The plan was first tried by the former Conservative government before being scrapped as jails filled, but Labour says its version will work long-term. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told MPs that it will ultimately help slash the record number of suspects being held waiting a trial.\n\nThe move is already facing a backlash from criminal lawyers who view it as a sticking plaster for a chronic lack of cash in a crisis-ridden system. Magistrates in England and Wales have historically been limited to sentencing offenders to a maximum of six months for a single offence. More serious cases were left for judges in crown courts. But there is a backlog of around 68,000 cases in those higher courts and a record 17,000 suspects on remand waiting for a trial. That backlog was primarily caused by cuts before the pandemic, but exacerbated by the 2020 national shutdown and a later strike by barristers. Last month, as the prisons reached capacity, the government began an emergency plan to let some offenders leave jail on a monitored licence after serving 40% of their term behind bars. The scheme aims to buy the system breathing space as the new government looks at major reforms to how sentencing should work.\n\nMs Mahmood told MPs that while the early release scheme was now working as planned, there was still an acute problem in jails holding too many remand prisoners. She said that by giving magistrates the power to decide cases that would lead to jail sentences of up to 12 months, the record remand population would begin to fall. In turn, with fewer suspects having to go to crown courts, judges would gain an extra 2,000 days a year to deal with the most serious cases and start to reduce the unprecedented delays. Critics say that the Conservatives' earlier attempt at this plan, between 2022 and 2023, failed because it led to more people in jail with very little change in the backlogs. The modelling for the new government's projections will be published when the new rules are formally presented to MPs. The BBC understands that official projections suggest the short-term population rise could turn out to be as little as 100, if the plan succeeds in getting more remand cases through the courts. Outlining the plan to the Commons, Ms Mahmood said ministers had had to make tough decisions that were ducked by their predecessors. \u201cThis Government inherited a criminal justice system in crisis, with dangerously overcrowded prisons and victims waiting far too long to see justice,\u201d she said. \u201cThis marks a further step towards addressing the deep challenges in our criminal justice system, both reducing the record remand population in our jails and delivering swifter justice for victims.\u201d But the plan has already been met with dismay by criminal barristers. Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \u201cThis will simply make things worse. This is a knee-jerk reaction, done without consulting, once again, the criminal barristers or solicitors who deal every day with these cases. \u201cThis suggestion has been tried before but removed very quickly. \u201cDoubling magistrates\u2019 maximum sentencing powers will only increase pressure on reduced prison space, by speedily raising the much bigger sentenced prisoner population.\u201d Mark Beattie, chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, said that its members welcomed the new power to help deliver swifter justice. \u201cI know our members and colleagues will take up this increased responsibility with professionalism and integrity and will - as always - strive to deliver the highest quality of justice in their courts,\u201d he said.",
    "Many people who take up vaping have never been regular smokers\n\nThe number of adults in England to have started vaping despite never having been regular smokers has reached one million, scientists estimate. This is a sharp increase on 2020, with disposable vapes having been available since 2021. The rise is driven mostly by young adults - with about one out of every seven 18-24-year-olds who never regularly smoked now using e-cigarettes. While some may have benefited by taking up vapes instead of traditional cigarettes - the trend could be worrying, experts say.\n\nLead researcher, Dr Sarah Jackson, at University College London (UCL), said the public-health impact of the \"substantial rise\" in vaping among people who have never regularly smoked depended on what they would otherwise be doing. \u201cIt is likely that some would have smoked if vaping were not an available option,\" she said. \"In this case, vaping is clearly less harmful. \"However, for those who would not have gone on to smoke, vaping regularly over a sustained period poses more risk than not vaping.\u201d\n\nResearchers looked at surveys of about 150,000 adults in England between 2016 and 2024. Respondents agreeing with the statement: \u201cI have never been a smoker - ie smoked for a year or more,\" were counted as \"never regular smokers\". And between 2016 and 2020, only 0.5% of these vaped. But by April 2024, this had risen to 3.5%, with more than half aged between 18 and 24. Over the last few years, these \"never regular smokers\" who took up vapes tended to be younger, more were women, and more were drinking at increasing levels, than in the past, researchers say. The study, published in the journal Lancet Public Health, external journal and funded by charity Cancer Research UK, also found overall vaping figures among adults were levelling off.\n\u2022 None Disposable vapes to be banned for child health\n\nSenior researcher, Prof Jamie Brown, at UCL, said: \u201cThese findings are a reminder that action is required to try to minimise vaping among young people who have never previously smoked. \"However, a balancing act is required to avoid deterring smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit.\" Current government plans to ban disposable vapes were unlikely to be the solution, Prof Brown suggested, as popular brands had already launched reusable products that looked and costed almost the same. \u201cA sensible next step would be to introduce stricter regulation around product appearance, packaging and marketing,\" he added\n\nHazel Cheeseman, chief executive of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said the findings could be a cause for concern and suggested focusing on reducing the appeal of vapes would be the best way to limit the use of vapes in non-smokers. \"The aggressive marketing of products to young people means the government urgently needs to bring back the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, to regulate vape flavours, marketing and branding,\" she said. Peter Hajek, professor of clinical psychology, at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cThe just-released figures from the Office for National Statistics show that UK smoking prevalence is under 12%, an all-time low. \"If much less risky alternatives are allowed to continue to compete with cigarettes, smoking - and heart disease, lung disease and cancers that it causes - will continue to decline as well. \u201cThe UK and USA, which allow vaping, have seen significantly faster declines in cigarette sales and in smoking among young and low-income people than Australia, which bans vaping. \"\n\nDo you vape but have never smoked?

Some of the worst scenes were in the area around Jablanica, a town on the main route between the cities of Mostar and the capital, Sarajevo, about 70km (40 miles) to the north-east. A number of other people have been reported missing and a state of emergency has been declared. Development minister Vojin Mijatovic said the country had witnessed a terrible disaster and appealed for calm.\n\nThe area worst hit by flash floods and landslides was around Jablanica\n\nSearch and rescue work continues as more than a dozen people remain unaccounted for. On Sunday, two more bodies were found in the village of Donja Jablanica. Heavy rain apparently triggered a landslide from a quarry above the village that buried houses, with water levels rising to the roofline of some buildings. Rescuers were clearing the mud from inundated houses by hand. Teams from Serbia, Croatia and North Macedonia had arrived to support, and EU countries were also sending help. On Saturday, officials from the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton said 13 deaths had been confirmed in the area, rather than 16 as earlier reported. In the town of Fojnica, three other deaths were confirmed. Rivers burst their banks after an overnight storm and aerial photos showed many towns and villages left inundated. Roads, bridges and railway tracks were washed away or blocked by debris, while landslides left houses buried in rocks and earth as high as their upper storeys.\n\nSome of the worst scenes of flooding with in Jablanica and nearby villages\n\nThe main M-17 route, which runs alongside the River Neretva was covered in debris close to Jablanica and a 17km-stretch of railway was badly damaged between nearby Ostrozac and Grabovica to the west. One 200m stretch of track was left hanging in the air by a landslide close to the river south of Jablanica. The local authority in Herzegovina-Neretva Canton warned drivers to avoid dangerous roads around Jablanica. Further east along the Neretva river, one homeowner told Bosnian media that water had flooded house at 03:30 on Friday and that they barely managed to save their son before escaping to neighbours and seeing their house collapse. Meanwhile, 20km to the west of the capital around around Kiseljak, a torrent of water flooded the streets, leaving cars submerged.\n\nThe flooding was not confined to Bosnia. In neighbouring Montenegro, roads were washed away leaving the village of Komarnica cut off. Water levels were also rising in some of Croatia's rivers, and the government in Zagreb said there was a risk of some areas in the city of Karlovac being flooded close to the Kupa river. Much of Central Europe was hit by floods last month, with some of the worst devastation in Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said one four-day period had been the rainiest ever recorded in the region. They said the floods had been made much worse by climate change. Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The last five years were on average around 2.3C warmer than the second half of the 19th Century, according to the Copernicus climate service.",
    "Life of Janey Godley, Glaswegian pub landlady who became street-fighter of comedy\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nJaney Godley, who has died aged 63, turned an early life full of pain and tragedy into a successful comedy career. A tough upbringing in the east end of Glasgow was the thread which ran through her humour. Often angry, she specialised in wringing laughs out of the most unlikely material. Her act mirrored the city that shaped her: working-class, foul-mouthed, simultaneously angry and sentimental. She delivered her comic broadsides at high speed, jabbing her points home like a street-fighter. For her fans, she was one of them - and as her reputation grew so did her influence. The former pub landlady became close friends with Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, after her videos voicing-over the FM's Covid press conferences became a viral sensation.\n\nShe was born Jane Godley Currie on 20 January 1961 in the Shettleston area of Glasgow, the youngest of four children. Both her parents were addicted to alcohol and the family home was both chaotic and very poor. As a young child she was sexually abused by an uncle. Thirty years later in 1996, she and her sister went public to talk about the abuse after their evidence convicted David Percy. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Interviewed at the time, she said: \"We waited 30 years but we did it, and we did it together. Anyone who has been abused knows you cannot shake off the guilt. But the guilty one was Percy.\" There was more tragedy. In 1982 her mother Annie was found dead in the River Clyde. Godley was convinced she had been murdered by her violent boyfriend though the man was never charged, despite the family's calls for an investigation. By then, Godley had married and was running a pub with her husband in the Calton area of Glasgow. They had a daughter, Ashley Storrie, who would later follow her mother into comedy.\n\nAshley Storrie followed her mum into comedy\n\nHer in-laws became an integral part of her comedy act. She often spoke of their criminal connections and it was a family dispute that led to her taking to the stage in her mid-30s. The schism forced them to leave the pub and left them homeless and out of work. She had been performing at occasional open-mic nights but began taking it more seriously. Years of honing her comic patter behind a bar helped and she quickly became established on the comedy circuit. Her stage act was uncompromising. In 2019 she spoke to the Guardian about her material. \"I spoke about my ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: 'You shouldn't talk about that.' But I'm so glad I did. \"The amount of people that came up to me and said: 'I was abused and I've never laughed before'.\"\n\nJaney Godley was close to former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\n\nAs her fame grew she wrote a memoir and novel and became a regular on panel shows. She appeared with Billy Connolly and the late Antony Bourdain, and played a barmaid in the film Wild Rose. Two things introduced her to a global audience and brought her into the world of politics. In 2016 she was photographed at the Turnberry golf resort holding a sign with an offensive word, protesting the visit by the club's owner, President Trump. The picture went viral. Then, during the Covid lockdowns, she began creating videos in which she voiced-over Nicola Sturgeon's media briefings, portraying the first minister as a plain-talking, occasionally foul-mouthed figure, exhausted by the demands of the pandemic and exasperated by the media's questions. A committed supporter of independence, she had appeared on stage with Alex Salmond and was praised by Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nGodley was a committed and enthusiastic supporter of Scottish independence\n\nThat connection was tested in September 2021 when comments she had posted on social media a decade before came back to haunt her. She was dropped as the face of a Scottish government health campaign and admitted the tweets had \"terrible, horrific undertones\". Two months later, Godley revealed she had ovarian cancer. She documented her illness and treatments on social media and by touring. For a while she was considered clear of the disease but in December 2022 she announced that it had returned. She had been told she could die within the year but continued working. She made a BBC radio programme about her condition and remained a presence on X, formerly Twitter. She was a contributor to BBC programmes including Have I Got News For You and Breaking the News. More recently she made a BBC documentary following her 2023 tour called Janey. In April that year she won the inaugural Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow Award. He said: \"She's a great girl, a great comedian and an extraordinary life story.\" Godley said: \"I can't believe I've won this. I have won an award from a man that I've admired since I was a child.\" Holding up the prize, she said \"This is going to be my tombstone.\"",
    "In a warming Arctic, polar bears are spending more of their time on land\n\nAs the Arctic warms, polar bears face a growing risk of contracting viruses, bacteria and parasites that they were less likely to encounter just 30 years ago, research has revealed. In a study that has provided clues about how polar bear disease could be linked to ice loss, scientists examined blood samples from bears in the Chukchi Sea - between Alaska and Russia. They analysed samples that had been gathered between 1987 and 1994, then collected and studied samples three decades later - between 2008 and 2017. The researchers found that significantly more of the recent blood samples contained chemical signals that bears had been infected with one of five viruses, bacteria or parasites.\n\nWildlife biologist Karyn Rode (here with a sedated wild polar bear) and her colleagues collected blood samples from wild bears to monitor the animals' health\n\nIt is difficult to know, from blood samples, how the bears\u2019 physical health was affected, but wildlife biologist Dr Karyn Rode from the US Geological Survey said it showed that something was changing throughout the whole Arctic ecosystem. The researchers tested for six different pathogens in total - viruses, bacteria or parasites that are primarily associated with land-based animals but have been recorded before in marine animals, including species that polar bears hunt. The study covered three decades, Dr Rode said, \u201cwhen there had been a substantial loss of sea ice and there\u2019s been increased land use in [this population of polar bears]\". \u201cSo we wanted to know if exposure had changed - particularly for some of these pathogens that we think are primarily land-oriented.\u201d The five pathogens, as disease-causing agents are collectively called, that have become more common in polar bears, are two parasites that cause toxoplasmosis and neosporosis, two types of bacteria that cause rabbit fever and brucellosis, and the virus that causes canine distemper. \"Bears in general are pretty robust to disease,\" explained Dr Rode. \"It's not typically been known to affect bear population, but I think what it just highlights is that things [in the Arctic] are changing.\"\n\u2022 None There are about 26,000 polar bears left in the world, with the majority in Canada. Populations are also found in the US, Russia, Greenland and Norway\n\u2022 None Polar bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with climate change a key factor in their decline\n\u2022 None Adult males can grow to be around 3m long and can weigh close to 600kg\n\u2022 None Polar bears can eat up to 45kg of blubber in one sitting\n\u2022 None These bears have a powerful sense of smell and can sniff out prey from up to 16km away\n\u2022 None They are strong swimmers and have been spotted up to 100km offshore. They can swim at speeds of around 10km per hour, due in part to their paws being slightly webbed\n\nStudies with collar cameras have revealed what polar bears eat during the ice-free summer, as well as capturing surprising social interactions\n\nIn the US, polar bears are classified as a threatened species; scientists say the biggest threat to their future is the continuing loss of sea ice habitat, which they depend on as a platform from which to pounce on their marine prey. Previous research using collar cameras on bears has shown that, as they spend more of the year on land - when there is no available sea ice to hunt from - the bears are unable to find enough calories. Dr Rode explained that polar bears are top predators: \u201cOur study suggested that they're getting their exposure to some pathogens primarily through their prey species. \u201cSo what we saw as changes in pathogen exposure for polar bears is indicative of changes that other species are also experiencing.\u201d The findings are published in the scientific jou, externalrnal PLOS One, external.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "Teen who killed Holly Newton can be named - judge\n\nA judge has ruled Holly Newton's murderer can be named as her ex-boyfriend Logan MacPhail\n\nFifteen-year-old Holly Newton was murdered by her \"jealous\" ex-boyfriend, it can now be revealed. Holly was repeatedly stabbed in an alleyway in Hexham, Northumberland, by Logan MacPhail in January 2023. MacPhail, who was 16 at the time, had anonymity during his murder trial but ahead of sentencing, Judge Sir Nicholas Hilliard KC lifted reporting restrictions following an appeal by media groups, including the BBC. Holly's parents said their daughter's killing should be classed as a domestic violence offence rather than a knife crime.\n\nHolly Newton's killer will be sentenced at the end of October\n\nMacPhail, now 17, had turned up uninvited at Holly's home in Haltwhistle the night before the killing and stalked her through Hexham for almost an hour before he attacked. The pair met at army cadets in Consett and were in an \"on-and-off\" relationship for 18 months, which ended days before the killing. Holly's family said he was controlling and prosecutors described the relationship as \"toxic\". Holly's mother Micala Trussler had arranged a meeting with Northumbria Police to discuss her fears about him for the evening of 27 January, but Holly was killed hours before it could take place.\n\u2022 None 'I instantly knew my daughter's ex had killed her'\n\nMacPhail left his school in Gateshead at lunchtime and took a bus to Hexham. That morning, Holly told friends he was \"basically stalking\" her and feared he would be waiting outside her school, Queen Elizabeth High.\n\nHolly Newton had complained of her ex-boyfriend stalking her\n\nMacPhail messaged a friend of Holly's, lying about where he was and asking her to \"trick\" Holly into meeting him. After Holly left school with friends, MacPhail, wearing a cap and snood to conceal his face, tailed her round town for more than 45 minutes. CCTV footage showed his pursuit before he confronted her at a bus stop outside Pizza Pizza, on Priestpopple, at about 17:00 GMT.\n\nThey spoke for several minutes before Holly followed him into an alley where he launched a vicious attack which several people tried to stop. At his trial, he claimed he wanted to return some of Holly\u2019s possessions - slippers, clothes and teddy bears - but he had none of these with him.\n\nMacPhail initially told the murder trial his mind was \"blank\" during the attack and he was trying to kill himself with the knife, although the court heard he had no injuries. He then admitted deliberately stabbing her, later retracting his confession.\n\nMacPhail (in the red box) followed Holly (in the yellow frame) for almost an hour before attacking her\n\nHolly had 36 knife wounds to her head and body and died from catastrophic blood loss. The 8cm (3in) blade of the kitchen knife broke during the attack. Another youth who intervened was stabbed four times, with MacPhail also found guilty of his wounding.\n\nThe BBC applied for the reporting restriction, which was put in place because MacPhail was under 18, to be lifted. Mr Justice Hilliard said MacPhail had been convicted of \"grave crimes\" which were of local and national concern\" but the \"key factor\" of the killer's relationship with Holly could not be reported during the trial \"lest it might identify him\". The judge said it was \"impossible to have a full and proper understanding of the case and of why the defendant behaved as he did without knowing this factor\". He said there was \"great public concern\" about young people carrying knives and \"violence to women and girls\" and legitimate debate was aided by the public knowing the \"full detail of the offences\". A two-day sentencing hearing is due to begin on 31 October.",
    "Emergency services remain at the scene of the collision on Wednesday\n\nA man who died after the train he was travelling on collided with another train in mid Wales has been named locally as Tudor Evans. It has also been revealed that a driver of one train was \"quite badly injured\" and a conductor suffered a fracture, Transport for Wales (TfW) has confirmed. Four people were seriously injured in the crash near Llanbrynmair, Powys, on Monday evening, and a further 11 required hospital treatment, according to the Rail Accident Investigations Branch (RAIB). The line will be shut until at least Friday, and Network Rail said it would look at \"immediate lessons\" to stop any future crashes before it reopens.\n\nMr Evans had been travelling home on the 18:31 westbound service from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth on Monday evening when it hit a stationary train heading from Machynlleth to Shrewsbury. He was in his 60s and from Capel Dewi in Aberystwyth. Paying tribute, Iestyn Leyshon said he was \"extremely saddened\" to hear of the death of his friend, who was travelling home from a holiday in Italy. Mr Leyshon, from Aberystwyth, told the Newyddion S4C app, external he had known Mr Evans for about 20 years but got to know him well over the past four years through their shared passion for mountain biking. \u201cIt pains me to think that he and his wife had just begun to travel after years of work and then this tragedy happens,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll never see him on his bike on the Elenydd [an upland area of mid Wales] again.\u201d\n\nRIAB inspectors near the site of Monday evening's collision\n\nTfW's chief operating officer Jan Chaudhry-Van Der Velde also gave his sympathies to the family. He added that a driver of one of the trains was \"quite badly injured\" in the crash and taken to hospital in Shrewsbury, while a conductor suffered a fracture. Both the injured driver and conductor have received medical care and \"are on the road to recovery,\" he said. Mr Chaudhry-Van Der Velde did not say which of the trains the driver and the conductor were on, but confirmed the injured driver did not have time to leave the cab before the impact. He also said the trains' \"black boxes\" will be retrieved so all information can be passed to the investigators to help understand the cause. The crash happened on the Cambrian line in a rural location with a single track, close to a passing loop where trains travelling in opposite directions can pass each other. The RAIB deployed a team of inspectors to the site of the crash and said initial evidence suggested the collision occurred at a speed of approximately 24km/h (15mph). On initial inspection, the RAIB found that the train may have entered into wheel slide when braking.\n\nThe line between Machynlleth and Shrewsbury will remain closed until Friday 25 October\n\nThe investigation is continuing and is likely to continue for at least the next 24 hours, said Network Rail route director Nick Millington. He described the investigation as \"complex\" and said he was \"unable to speculate on if leaves on the tracks contributed to the crash\" but control and communication systems on the trains \"were being scrutinised\". Network Rail and TfW said the Cambrian line between Machynlleth and Shrewsbury will remain closed until at least the end of Friday. They thanked the community and said the investigation will move to a recovery operation to remove the affected trains over the coming days. A full report would take several months to be processed, said Mr Chaudhry-Van Der Velde.\n\nIt will be months before a full report will be finalised says TfW\n\nTransport Minister Ken Skates said the Welsh government's \"prime concern\" is safety. Politicians sent their thoughts to train crash victims during prime minister's questions on Wednesday. Speaking in the House of Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner sent her \"condolences to those affected by the train crash in Powys\". Deputy leader of the opposition Oliver Dowden echoed her comments about the crash. A passenger on the westbound train spoke of being knocked out by the impact after hearing \"emergency brakes slam on, then the screeching\". Bethan Evans, 23, was on the last leg of her journey when the collision took place. She said the crash had flung people out of their seats into the aisle, and her belongings were also thrown in the aisle. UK government Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said she was \"incredibly sorry\" to hear about the crash and safety on the railways is her \"absolute priority.\" She added: \"We are working at pace with Transport for Wales and Network Rail to understand what happened and how we can better prevent it going forward.\"",
    "A thick blanket of smog has derailed normal activity for most people\n\nAt first, you cannot see it but you can smell it. It smells like something is burning. And it intensifies as the temperature drops. Then the smoke and fog start to envelop you and the city around you. Now you can see it. You are walking through the smoke, a thick ceiling of it hanging overhead. If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air. Your throat might start to feel itchy and sore. As it gets worse, you start sneezing and coughing. But it's worse for others: children, the elderly, those with breathing difficulties. The hospitals know to expect the influx. Lahore and its 13 million residents have now been choking for a week; the air quality index has passed the 1,000 mark repeatedly this month - anything above 300 is considered hazardous.\n\nPakistani officials have scrambled to respond to the crisis - its scale unprecedented even in a city which deals with smog at this time each year. Schools are closed, workers have been told to stay home and people urged to stay indoors - part of a so-called \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d, which has also seen motorbike rickshaws, heavy vehicles and motorbike parking banned from hot spot areas. By the end of the week, Lahore High Court had ordered all the markets in the Punjab province to close by 20:00 each night, with complete closures on Sundays. Parks and zoos have also been shut until 17 November. The problem, according to Nasa scientist Pawan Gupta, is that pollution levels in the city \u201ctypically peak in late November and December\u201d. \u201cSo this is just beginning. The worst pollution days are probably still ahead of us,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe smoke that has enveloped Lahore, in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province, can be seen from space - as can part of the cause. Satellite images from the US space agency Nasa shows both the thick layer of smog and the multiple concentrations of fire in the region between the Indian capital, Delhi, and Pakistan\u2019s Lahore. The same image, six weeks earlier, shows clear skies and - crucially - far fewer fires. A major cause of the smog is the fires which are caused by the burning of stubble after harvest by farmers in both Pakistan and India - a quick way to clear their fields ready for the next crops.\n\nPakistan authorities accuse Indian farmers of causing 30% of the problem\n\nThis year, Nasa estimates it will count \u201cbetween 15,500 and 18,500 fires \u201d, according to Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Morgan State University, higher than most years. According to Pakistan\u2019s environment protection authorities, around 30% of Lahore\u2019s smog comes from across the border in India. The Indian government has this year doubled fines for farmers caught stubble-burning as it tries to deal with the issue. But much of Lahore\u2019s air pollution comes from its five million motorbikes and millions of other vehicles\u2019 exhausts. On Friday, Lahore's high court identified heavy traffic emissions as the main cause of the smog, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. Then there are the industries in the city\u2019s outskirts - like the coal-fired brick kilns - adding even more pollution to the air. And in the final months of the year, it all combines with cold air flowing down from Tibet, creating the smog which is currently sitting over the city.\n\nMany people, like this vegetable vendor, have no option but to go out and earn their living in smog\n\nThe state's high court has laid much of the blame on vehicle emissions\n\nIt is clear the toxic air is making people sick. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI), a value of 50 or below indicates good air quality, while a value above 300 signals Hazardous air quality. The WHO guidelines say the average concentration of PM2.5 level should be below five. Abid Omar, founder of Pakistan\u2019s Air Quality Initiative, which collects data from 143 air quality monitors across the country, says the readings in Lahore \u201chave hit beyond index on every day in November\u201d. \u201cSome locations in Lahore have exceeded 1,000,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cOn Thursday we had one reading of 1,917 on the AQI scale.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, it was widely reported 900 people had been admitted to hospital in Lahore with breathing difficulties. \u201cMore and more people are coming with complaints of asthma, itchy throats and coughing,\u201d says Dr Irfan Malik, a pulmonologist at one of the biggest hospitals in Lahore. He has already seen a surge in patients complaining of respiratory tract illnesses - \u201cparticularly worrying because we have not yet seen our first cold wave of the winter season\u201d. The danger is a constant concern for Lahore resident Sadia Kashif. \u201cLike every mother, I want to see my children run and play without fearing pollution,\u201d she tells the BBC. \u201cI see my children struggle with coughs and breathing problems these days, and it is a painful reminder that our air has become extremely toxic.\u201d But the current \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d has left her unimpressed. \u201cIt is easy for the government to shut down school rather than taking real steps to address the crisis,\u201d says Kashif.\n\nEmissions from brick kilns around Lahore also contribute to toxic air\n\nFor years, authorities have struggled to find a solution to Lahore\u2019s pollution problem. The government hopes short fixes will provide reprieve, but says long term solutions - like improving public transport - will take time. In the meantime, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced this week she intends to write a letter to her counterpart in Indian Punjab to invite them to engage in \u201cclimate diplomacy\u201d, since it impacts both regions. Delhi says it is yet to hear from Pakistan on the issue.\n\nOfficials are using a number of short-term measures like spraying water to bring down dust particles\n\nHowever, Omar points out air pollution is not a seasonal problem but a persistent issue. \u201cLahore is much more polluted than Delhi with pollution episodes that last longer and reach higher peaks,\u201d he notes. And it is getting worse, he believes. As per his own analysis of data, October has seen a 25% rise in pollution level compared to the same period last year.

    "What the farmers' protest tells us about their argument with the government\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in central London, many with their children in tow\n\nThe farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children. They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation. For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters. As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster. They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy. I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.\n\nI love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too. And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it. This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts: Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation. It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion. That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.\n\nSecondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different. The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing. Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax. And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp. Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money. Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others. And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich? Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds. These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich. Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do. The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign. Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change. You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Influencers risking death in hurricanes for clicks and cash\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWhile millions of people in Florida fled Hurricane Milton, Mike Smalls Jr ventured into the violent winds in Tampa, Florida, holding a blow-up mattress, an umbrella and a pack of ramen noodles. He went outside Wednesday evening as the storm pounded the US state and livestreamed on the platform Kick. He told his online audience if he reached 10,000 views, he would launch himself and his mattress into the water. Once he hit the threshold, he took the plunge. Then he got worried: \u201cThe wind started picking up and I don\u2019t know how to swim\u2026so I had to grab on to the tree.\u201d The area was under an evacuation order - meaning residents had been advised by local officials to leave their homes, for their own safety. Mike\u2019s hour-long stream from Tampa Bay has more than 60,000 views on the streaming platform Kick, and has been seen by millions after being clipped up and posted on other social-media platforms, including X. Live streaming - filming yourself in real time - has become increasingly lucrative for content creators looking to make quick money. But these streams can involve dangerous stunts, as content creators try to stand out in an increasingly competitive environment. Many people have criticised Mike's behaviour on social media, suggesting he\u2019s risking his life for clicks. He made it safely - and told me he'd do the risky stunt again, \u201cif the price is right\u201d. When asked about the backlash, he admits what he did was \u201ccontroversial\u201d and acknowledges that some might think he is risking not just his life, but the lives of those who might have to save him. But, he added: \u201cFrom a content creator standpoint, people like to see kind of edgy things.\"\n\u2022 None 'The tornado was inside our house' - Florida reels after Milton\n\u2022 None 'It's eerie to see its power' - Florida woman documents 20 hours in hurricane\u2019s path in messages to BBC\n\u2022 None Helene is deadliest mainland US hurricane since Katrina The Tampa Police Department said in a statement: \u201cIgnoring mandatory evacuation orders puts lives at risk. When individuals disregard these warnings, they not only jeopardise their own safety, but also create additional challenges for first responders who are working tirelessly to save lives. \"Intentionally placing oneself in harm's way could divert critical resources and delay vital rescue operations for others.\" Hundreds of people have died during this year\u2019s hurricane season, which has devastated parts of the US south-eastern coast. Millions had been forced to evacuate as Hurricane Milton, which at its peak was measured as a category 5 storm, made landfall on Wednesday along Florida's Gulf Coast. At least 16 people have died in the storm, millions are still without power and thousands had to be rescued by first responders as water overtook homes. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have bookended an exceptionally busy period of tropical weather in the US. In less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed - not far off from what the Atlantic would typically see during an entire year.\n\nMike Smalls Jr floated on a mattress during one hurricane and pitched a tent under an overpass for another\n\nMike is one of a number of content creators on social media platforms, including Kick and TikTok, who have been livestreaming and making money from pulling reckless stunts and risking their lives in hurricanes. Livestreaming content is Mike\u2019s full-time job, he says. Previous stunts posted on his profile include setting fireworks off inside a bedroom and winding up staff in fast-food restaurants. His plan for livestreaming Hurricane Milton was: \u201cGet some nice clips, and then, if things get too wild, I can, just, you know, track my little five, 10-minute walk back home,\u201d he added. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d exposed himself to danger. A few weeks before Milton struck, he went out into Hurricane Helene - which also hit Florida - carrying a tent as a prop and livestreamed for more than five hours. He filmed himself on his phone holding up the tent in an underpass, saying he was \u201cgoing to survive the hurricane. Why? To entertain the people\u201d. Just metres away, the ocean was crashing over barriers. \u201cIt's my job just to entertain and think of creative things to entertain my chat. And if people want to, you know, if they're inspired by what I do, I respect it,\" he said, adding you have to gauge and \"do things at your own risk\". Platforms like Kick offer incentives: money for the number of views streamers get and donations from people who like what they\u2019re doing. Smalls Jr did not specify how much money he earned from this particular livestream, but said the metrics vary from streamers, with some making $300 to $400 per hour. He added he made enough from his latest stream to pay a few bills.\n\u2022 None No, Hurricane Milton was not 'engineered'\n\u2022 None Explainer: Why is Hurricane Milton causing so many tornadoes in Florida\n\nIt might appear, Mike says, that he\u2019s doing anything for views, but he says he takes safety very seriously. Despite not knowing how to swim, he insists that he assessed the risks. He speaks with bravado after surviving the natural disaster: \u201cI stayed here, and I didn\u2019t die and I\u2019m chilling.\" When asked to respond to specific questions on Smalls Jr and the platform\u2019s responsibility, Kick said it is \u201ca fiercely creator-first platform, and we do not influence the content our creators chose to stream. However, if that content breaches our Terms of Service, or is in any way illegal, then we can impose a ban or suspension\". They did not comment when asked about whether Smalls Jr's action breach their specific community guidelines which detail: \"Safety First: Prioritise safety for yourself, your audience, the public and anyone else involved.\" TikTok told the BBC that their monetisation guidelines lay out how some content is not eligible to earn money through LIVE features, including \u201ccontent that tricks or manipulates others\u2026 exploits controversial issues to bait engagement, or exploits the suffering of vulnerable people\u201d. Mike\u2019s profile - and his hurricane content - is still available. When asked about endangering the lives of emergency workers, Smalls Jr said he knows what he's getting himself into. \"Don\u2019t save me,\" he said. \"If I do another hurricane? All right. You ain't got to say nothing. I do not want to put your life at risk. No.\u201d",
    "US swing state voters: 'You have a big say on what happens in the entire world'\n\nIn US elections, it's not only who you vote for that matters - just as important can be where you live. The 2024 presidential race will likely come down to seven key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. With tight margins expected, the people that live in these states are the most sought after by political campaigns. As Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump vie for their attention, here's what swing state voters had to say about the at-times stressful role they play.\n\nThis small business owner from western Pennsylvania is a registered Democrat who plans to vote for Harris. I\u2019m out in the rural parts of the state and there's a lot of Trump support out here. But there's also a lot of people that at a certain point... there's certain things that just aren't acceptable. Just the way a lot of us are raised out here, there's things that he's done that it's just not right. [The political advertising] is annoying more than anything else because everybody knows at the end of the day, the advertisements are packed full of lies. We're potentially playing kingmaker here. It is kind of nerve-wracking knowing that we're going to play such a big role because there's a lot of people that are just so burnt out about everything... It's very strange knowing that your neighbours are probably going to have a really big say in what happens in the entire world for the next four years.\n\nAndy lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The retired Marine plans to vote for Trump, who he backed in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. One neighbour across the street might have two Trump signs and then the neighbour next door might have four Harris signs. It's like a battle of who can out-sign the other person. To be at the forefront of the voting every year is cool in a sense that it puts us on the map, but not necessarily always for the best things. I recently moved back [to Pennsylvania] in 2018. When I was coming up to visit my now-wife, I saw Trump signs everywhere in 2016 and I thought: He's going to win. In 2020, I saw less Trump signs and I just got a vibe that there's no way he's going to win. Now, it's 50-50. I have no idea what's going to happen.\n\nThis independent voter has lived most of her life in Wisconsin. The 74 year old is retired and plans to vote for Harris. We are constantly bombarded with political ads on TV... I did see a big, lighted Trump sign when I went shopping. I was sort of shocked by it. It\u2019s a huge sign. I'm just very suspicious about what's going on with a lot of the people in the ads. It's gotten just much worse. The ads have gotten horrendous... distortion is so over the top. I'm definitely voting for Harris and I'm worried because it seems that MAGA [Trump's Make America Great Again movement] can really distort things and confuse people so easily.\n\nThis engineer from the swing state of Michigan is a Democrat who is planning to vote for Harris in November. I've never voted Republican once in my life and I'm still getting mailers in my mailbox addressed to me on practically a daily basis from the Republican Party. It is non-stop, incessant up here and it's exhausting. I want to say that it's really disheartening [to carry the weight of a swing state] because I personally believe in more of a ranked-choice voting style and not necessarily the electoral college. Being part of a state where it is a little bit more neck and neck and more decisive, it's one of those places where I can understand people really need to go out to make their voices heard. But it shouldn't just be focused on this state. Every state should have a similar amount of people wanting to get out, vote and make their voices heard.\n\nJonathan is a teacher who became a US citizen this year. He plans to cast his first vote for Trump. I generally don\u2019t understand - very little changes when a Republican or a Democrat becomes president. I don\u2019t quite understand the hysteria. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many people my age who I hang around with who are desperate for either candidate. Trump talks about the treatment of migrants versus the abortion issue and the treatment of the unborn. I land on Trump being a lesser evil than Kamala Harris in regards to that. I barely watch any typical American television. We probably get more mail in the house, but that\u2019s because now I\u2019m registered to vote so I\u2019m seeing more. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly more prevalent.\n\nThis independent voter backed Biden in the last presidential election and plans to vote for Harris this year. Biden only narrowly won Arizona in 2020. It seems to me that the Trump voters are more on public display. They have their flags. They have their signs. They have their bumper stickers. I don't know if they're proud or they're trying to convince everybody else to do something, but it seems more prevalent that you see that. I've seen a few Harris signs and I like them. But I think that the people who support Harris are not as in your face. I sometimes get nervous because I want Harris to win, but I say to myself: \"I can do one thing. I can only do one thing and that's put my vote in and that's all I can do.\"\n\nThis independent voter is a greenskeeper at a Michigan golf course who plans on reluctantly backing Trump in the election. I live in a rural area, so it's very, very Trumpy up here. It\u2019s almost embarrassing because we get a lot of tourists up here and it's like: You guys are going to put so much Trump stuff on your walls? I have mentioned to my wife that I'm the one the campaigns are aiming at. I'm an independent voter in a swing state. I just view myself as a drop in a bucket when it comes down to it. I understand the way it's working out with the electoral college and I'm in a swing state, so my vote is a little more unusually valuable than it normally would be. But I try not to think about it that way. I'm just a regular guy casting my vote like everybody else.\n\nThis 34-year-old teacher in the swing state of Georgia is an independent voter who plans to vote for Harris. I'm definitely anxious. I know this is a really tight knit race between our two candidates. Political ads are everywhere. Every streaming service, every YouTube video, everything has ads. I've noticed that the Harris-Walz campaign is definitely putting out more advertising than I've noticed from the Trump-Vance campaign here in Georgia. I think it's exciting. I'm excited to see Georgia being a battleground state. For so long, it was staunchly red and staunchly Republican. To have this kind of conversation and be able to know that my vote matters a little bit more and that it's more important than it may have been traditionally is exciting. It's firing me up to get involved in the political process.\n\nThis legal assistant from Beaver, Pennsylvania - the swing state with the highest number of electoral votes - is a Democrat who will be voting for Harris. I'm trying to remain optimistic, but I'm still pretty anxious, because it is Pennsylvania and you're surrounded by the division everywhere. I guess that's what continues to make me anxious living in Pennsylvania and knowing how important Pennsylvania is for these federal elections. I hate to see how purple it is right now. It feels like a responsibility to be from a state like this. The conversation about being in Pennsylvania and the burden of how many delegates we have and all of this - it's really wild.\n\nIn the lead-up to election day, BBC Voter Voices is hearing from Americans around the country about what matters to them.

    "A song from a film featuring popular Bollywood duo Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol came out on top\n\nA blockbuster film track has been voted the UK's favourite noughties Bollywood tune. BBC Asian Network asked listeners to pick their Ultimate 00s Bollywood song from a shortlist of 50 tracks. The list was picked by a panel including station presenters Haroon Rashid, Nikita Kanda, Gagan Grewal and Vallisa Chauhan, along with industry experts Asim Burney, Natasha Retnasingam and music producer Farooq Got Audio. Many of the songs on the list such as Kal Ho Naa Ho's title track, Desi Girl from comedy romance Dostana and Teri Ore from comedy action Singh is Kinng are considered to have soundtracked people\u2019s significant life moments.\n\nBut there could only be one winner: Bole Chudiyan from the iconic film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Released in 2001, the track is remembered for being the signature sound of the family drama movie featuring some of Bollywood's biggest names such as Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Hrithik Roshan. Composed by Jatin-Lalit and written by Sameer Anjaan, the song also features five powerhouse vocalists - Amit Kumar, Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan and Kavita Krishnamurthy.

    "Welsh dentistry 'no example' to England\n\nLast month, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told the Labour Party Conference the \"UK government will take inspiration from Wales on dentistry\" due to reforms\n\nThe idea that Welsh dentistry is an example to England is \"laughable\", a representative of the sector has said. Labour politicians have said Wales has created 400,000 appointments over the past two years. But the British Dental Association (BDA) said that did not take into account the needs of individual patients, while one said he had been suffering dental pain for years. Health Secretary Jeremy Miles said ministers were working with the BDA to reform dentistry contracts to \"focus more on patient needs\".\n\nDental pain sufferer Matty Parry: \"It\u2019s horrendous how people can't get a dentist\"\n\nMatty Parry from Old Colwyn, Conwy county, said he had been pushed from one dentist to another while having dental pain for five years. He is still trying to register for treatment but has been told by one dentist that could mean another two-and-a-half years of waiting. \"It's a shambles,\" he said. \"It\u2019s horrendous how people can't get a dentist. \"They probably need to do more courses, they need to promote it more, to train people up.\" He said paying for treatment was \"unreal\". \"I know people that have spent thousands of pounds on treatment, when really should it be that much?\" Last month, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told the Labour Party Conference the \"UK government will take inspiration from Wales on dentistry, where reforms have already unlocked almost 400,000 appointments in the last two years\". But the latest available figures from the Welsh and UK governments show how dental treatment levels have recovered since Covid. England completed 85% of the average number of courses of treatment being done pre-Covid, but in Wales that figure was much lower, at 58%.\n\nDr Russell Gidney from the BDA said: \"The Welsh dental service is struggling to cope\"\n\nDr Russell Gidney, who runs a dental practice in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, and is a leading member of the BDA, said colleagues were abandoning their NHS contracts because of the targets they were being set, and the financial clawbacks they face if they do not treat enough patients. He said it meant meeting targets were more important than giving people the treatment they need. \"The Welsh dental service is struggling to cope,\" he said. \"There are patient numbers being seen but, because practices are being pushed towards numbers of patients - although that statistic looks good - actually, what they're able to deliver on most patients, is suffering. \"It really is whitewashing the problems that are happening underneath.\" On Wales being held up as an example to England, Dr Gidney said: \"Fundamentally, I find it laughable. \"We've seen more clawback applied to practice since Covid. \"We see more practices hand back their contracts every year than we saw in several years pre-Covid. \"Dentists aren't happy because they can't take care of their patients. \"They can't make the business work as they want to, and fundamentally, where it carries on as it is, it is causing the patients to suffer as well.\"\n\nDr Helen Howson from the health think tank, the Bevan Commission, said the idea of cooperation in all areas of health could bring benefits. \"Partnership and collaboration will actually be a critical part of us finding the solutions we need, and working together will be important,\" she said. \"I think now we have a much more conducive environment to innovate and share and learn together, and that positive and constructive dialogue with all partners, whether it's England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or our international partners, can only be a good thing.\" On Sunday, Health Secretary Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that, while the number of patients receiving treatment had increased in the past 18 months, with 120,000 having received urgent treatment, \"dentistry isn't where we want it to be\". \"What we have done is to reform the dental contract with the BDA in order to focus more on patient needs rather than those regular six monthly check-ups which most people don't need,\" he said. \"The task now is to see what further reforms we can make.\" The Welsh government said changes introduced since 2022 have improved access for around 500,000 people. It said it was working with the BDA to \"explore how reform of the national dental contract can encourage dental practices to work together at a local level\".",
    "BBC apologises to Abbington but her claims only partly upheld\n\nAmanda Abbington was paired with Giovanni Pernice on last year's series of Strictly\n\nThe BBC has apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, but cleared him of the most serious allegations. BBC News has been told that while complaints of verbal bullying and harassment were upheld, claims of physical aggression were not. The Sherlock actress called the BBC's apology a \"vindication\" of her complaint and said she hoped others would now feel \"more confident\" that they would be believed. Pernice said he was relieved that allegations that he was threatening and abusive \"were found not to be true\".\n\nIn its statement on Monday, the BBC said that the production team did take steps to address the issues at the time but acknowledged that \"ultimately, these were not enough\". \"This is why the measures we have taken to further strengthen our existing protocols are so important,\" it said. Abbington had previously accused Pernice of being \"unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean\" during their rehearsals, which he had always strongly denied.\n\u2022 None Strictly: The Story Behind the Headlines\n\nThe BBC said it takes allegations of bullying and harassment \"very seriously\", adding the review into Abbington's complaints had taken time \"due to its complex nature\" and in order to ensure \"a rigorous and robust process\". \"We have assessed the complaints and we have upheld some, but not all, of the complaints made,\" it said. \"We want to apologise to Amanda Abbington and to thank her for coming forward and taking part. We know this would not have been an easy thing to do.\"\n\nAmanda Abbington withdrew from Strictly Come Dancing in October 2023\n\nIn recent media interviews, Abbington said she first raised concerns about Pernice's behaviour with Strictly producers on her third day, and had \"many\" more discussions with programme bosses. She eventually dropped out in week six, expressing her \"deepest regret\" at having to leave the show for \"medical\" and \"personal reasons\". She later lodged a formal complaint about Pernice. The actress has since claimed the BBC had known about his behaviour for years. She has also said she and her family had received death threats after she spoke out. Charlotte Moore, chief content officer for the BBC, told BBC News that it was \"terrible\" Abbington had been subjected to online abuse, and personally apologised to Abbington twice. BBC News has been told the review looked into 17 complaints and six were upheld but we have been unable to independently verify this. The statement itself did not go into detail about the nature of the complaints. But a source told BBC News that those upheld related to verbal bullying and harassment. The most serious allegations of physical aggression were not upheld. When asked by BBC News for more information about the complaints, Moore said: \u201cI'm not able to go into further detail on that, and there are very good reasons for that. \"It's probably worth me just laying out the confidentiality of a complaints process, which I think is absolutely integral to the complaints process, and confidentiality needs to be respected out of fairness to everybody involved.\u201d\n\nResponding to the BBC's statement, Abbington said that coming forward \"was not an easy thing to do\". \"In the days, weeks and months since I contacted the BBC, I\u2019ve been accused of being a liar, a troublemaker and of being 'mad and unstable'. \"I\u2019ve also received rape and murder threats and a bomb threat was sent to my place of work. My family and children have also been subjected to threats and intimidation. \"Despite this vile abuse, I\u2019ve never regretted coming forward, and today\u2019s apology from the BBC is a vindication of my complaint. \"It\u2019s not just a vindication for me, it\u2019s a vindication for the other people who have contacted me since I made my complaint to express concerns about their own experiences on Strictly Come Dancing. I hope those who have felt unable to speak out now will be more confident that they will be listened to and believed.\"\n\u2022 None A timeline of how the Strictly saga has unfolded Abbington added that the BBC had invited her to meet with senior management and that she would be considering this. \"This apology means a great deal to me. So too does the fact that the BBC have acknowledged the steps that were put in place to support and protect me and past contestants were \u201cnot enough\u201d. \"What matters most now is that lessons have been learned and that the BBC makes the changes they\u2019ve promised, to ensure others don\u2019t experience the same ordeal that I and others like me did.\" In a statement, Pernice said: \u2018I\u2019m glad the review has finally come to an end. I'm relieved that the allegations that I was threatening and abusive were found not to be true. \"The majority of the false allegations have been thrown out by the review. It has been an extremely difficult year, reading story after story and not being able to say anything in return as I respected the integrity of the review, which the BBC asked everyone to do.\" He added that he loved his time on Strictly and made \"amazing memories\". \"I\u2019m grateful to all those who have supported me at this time \u2013 I really don\u2019t know how I would have got through this with out the love and belief of my family, friends, colleagues and fans.\" The BBC announced a string of new measures in July, include introducing chaperones in all rehearsal rooms, as well as including two new welfare producers on the show. Earlier this year, the BBC confirmed that Pernice would not return to the Strictly professional line-up for the new series. The new series of Strictly Come Dancing launched on BBC One earlier this month. Pernice has now joined his native Italy's talent dance show, Ballando con le Stelle.",
    "Sum 41 singer alleges abuse by ex-manager in new memoir\n\nSum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley has alleged in a new memoir that he was abused for years by the Canadian rock band's former manager. In the memoir, Whibley accuses the band's first manager, Greig Nori, of grooming and sexually abusing him starting when he was a teenager. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, external, the singer says he kept the dark side of the relationship secret from his bandmates for years.\n\nSum 41 are a multi-award winning punk band formed in 1996 that have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. Whibley's memoir, Walking Disaster: My Life Through Heaven and Hell, which was published on Tuesday, documents the ups and downs of the band's early start in the Toronto music scene and its rise to international stardom. Its beginning was aided in part by Mr Nori - then in his 30s and the frontman of a popular Canadian indie band. He met Whibley after a show and begin to mentor him. Mr Nori later became the fledgling band's manager. Whibley said one night, Mr Nori suddenly, \"passionately\" kissed him in a bathroom stall at a rave, surprising and confusing the then-18 year old, who was high on ecstasy at the time. He alleges Mr Nori coerced him into an unwanted sexual relationship that lasted about four years. \"Greig kept pushing for things to happen when we were together,\" he writes in the memoir, according to the Toronto Star. \"I started feeling like I was being pressured to do something against my will.\" When the physical relationship ended, Whibley, now 44, alleges Mr Nori continued with verbal and psychological abuse. Whibley alleges he revealed the relationship to his former wife, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne, who said: \"That's abuse! He sexually abused you.\" The couple were married from 2006 to 2009. The Sum 41singer told the Toronto Star , externalin an interview that he thought the relationship with Mr Nori would be \"a deep, dark secret I was going to take to my grave\". \"But I didn't know how to tell the story [of the band] without it, because it was so intertwined with everything that was going on in my life back at that point, almost on a daily basis.\" The band parted ways with Mr Nori in 2005. Mr Nori told the Globe and Mail that Whibley's claims were \"false allegations\", and said he had retained a defamation lawyer. The BBC has reached out to Mr Nori for comment. In a statement to the Toronto Star on Thursday, Mr Nori said that: \u201cThe accusation that I initiated the relationship is false. I did not initiate it. Whibley initiated it, aggressively.\u201d He said the relationship eventually \"faded out. Consensually\". Whibley told the LA Times he did not warn Mr Nori about the allegations in the memoir before it was published. \u201cI\u2019ve had an inner battle, like, \u2018Why do I want to tell him? Because I feel like I\u2019m supposed to? Because he still has this thing over me?'\" he told the newspaper. Sum 41 are currently on their farewell world tour and will be disbanding after 28 years together.",

The fruit cake was found under a bed in a suitcase, 77 years after the original 9ft (2.7m) cake was dished out to 2,000 guests. It was gifted by the then-Princess Elizabeth to Marion Polson, the housekeeper at The Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh from 1931 to 1969. \"It's a real little find, a little time capsule of glorious cake,\" said James Grinter, of Colchester-based auction house Reeman Dansie.\n\nThe cake, initially expected to fetch \u00a3500, was sold to a bidder from China who purchased it over the phone.\n\nThe cake was still in its original presentation box when it was discovered by Ms Polson's family\n\nMs Polson was given a slice as a token of thanks for purchasing the newlyweds a \"delightful\" dessert service.

    "The four Tory leadership candidates made speeches in Birmingham\n\nThe four Conservative leadership hopefuls have set out their visions for reforming the party after its historic defeat in the general election this year. Tom Tugendhat, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch tried to woo members in speeches to their party\u2019s conference in Birmingham. Cleverly said the party needed to be \u201cmore normal\u201d to win back voters who deserted them for Reform UK. Tugendhat pledged a \u201cnew Conservative revolution\u201d that focused on delivering better public services. Jenrick called for a \u201cnew Conservative Party\u201d and promised \u201can effective freeze in net migration\u201d, while Badenoch said she would \u201creprogramme the British state\u201d based on \u201crenewed Conservative principles\u201d.\n\nThe Tory leadership contest has dominated the conference as the party seeks to recover from its worst-ever performance at a general election in July. In a break with tradition, the four candidates closed the conference with their speeches to the party faithful, rather than outgoing Conservative leader Rishi Sunak. After being grilled by delegates and the media for days, the four would-be leaders will be whittled down to two in a vote by Tory MPs next week. Conservative members will then pick the new leader from the final two in a final vote, with the result announced on 2 November. In their speeches, each candidate attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and said their party could win the next general election under their leadership, but not without changing its direction.\n\nTom Tugendhat spoke about his experience in the military\n\nTugendhat, who was up first on the conference stage, said there had not been enough \u201csubstance\u201d in the Tory leadership campaign. A former security minister, he talked up his experience in the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and how that would make him an effective leader. He made a direct appeal to voters who abandoned the Tories for Reform, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The truth was, he said, many who shared Conservative values did not vote for them. He said the Tories needed to \"focus on what the British people need and be absolutely ruthless about delivering it, from health care and immigration to security and education\". \u201cWe need a new Conservative revolution,\u201d he added. \u201cThat's what Margaret Thatcher did. That's what we must do again, and we can do it.\u201d\n\nJames Cleverly said his party should copy former US President Ronald Reagan\n\nCleverly opened his speech by saying \u201csorry\u201d to Conservative activists for the result of the general election, on behalf of Tory MPs. But in an upbeat speech peppered with jokes, the former home and foreign secretary said he knew from his past life in business what it felt like to fail and get back up again. He said his political hero was former Republican US President Ronald Reagan and suggested the Conservative Party should follow his example. \u201cLet\u2019s be enthusiastic, relatable, positive, optimistic,\u201d Cleverly said. \u201cLet\u2019s be more normal.\u201d He said Reform UK was just a \u201cpale imitation\u201d of his party and stressed there would be \u201cno mergers, no deals\u201d. And to enthusiastic applause, he called for the abolition of \u201cbad taxes like stamp duty\u201d and more housebuilding.\n\nRobert Jenrick has focused his pitch on his plan to slash immigration\n\nJenrick - the bookies\u2019 favourite to win - said he would rebuild \u201ca new Conservative party\u201d, an echo of New Labour in the 1990s. The former immigration minister admitted the last Conservative government \u201cfailed to deliver the strong NHS, the strong economy and, yes, the strong border we promised\u201d. In language used by Reform UK MPs, Jenrick outlined five changes the party must make to challenge Labour, including \"securing our borders\u201d and \u201cdefending our culture\u201d. He said he would introduce \u201can effective freeze in net migration\u201d and leave the European Convention on Human Rights, an international treaty. Jenrick, who voted to remain in the 2016 EU referendum, promised a British Bill of Rights to \u201cfinish the job\u201d begun by Brexit, and an increase in defence spending, funded by cutting overseas aid.\n\nLast to speak was Badenoch, who pledged a \u201creboot\u201d of the British state as she attacked what she branded \u201cagressive identity politics\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d. Speaking about her upbringing in Nigeria, Badenoch said she valued \u201cConservative freedoms\u201d and had \u201cseen what happens when a country loses sight of those principles\u201d. The former business secretary argued that the UK\u2019s system of government was \u201cbroken\u201d and her party needed to go back to \u201cfirst principles\u201d to fix it. \u201cIf I become leader, we will immediately begin a once in a generation undertaking,\u201d she said, promising a \u201ccomprehensive plan to reprogramme the British state\u201d. Her plan, she said, would focus on reforming international agreements, human rights laws, the Treasury, the Bank of England, the civil service and NHS. She said her campaign was about \u201crenewal\u201d in time for the next general election, adding: \u201cWe have it in our power to make the 2030s a golden decade.\u201d In the party\u2019s first conference out of government for 15 years, the round of speeches followed the same format that propelled David Cameron into pole position for the leadership in 2005. In that conference, Cameron spoke without a full text of his speech, while this time all but Jenrick used a teleprompter.",
    "A Texas Supreme Court has said the execution of Robert Roberson - a Texas man who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter - can proceed. He was set to be the first person in the US to be executed for a murder related to \"shaken baby syndrome\", but legal challenges, prompted by some public outcry, paused the execution at the last minute last month. The Texas Supreme Court's decision means a state court judge will set a new execution date. Roberson has long maintained his innocence. His lawyers say new evidence shows the child died of complications from pneumonia.\n\nJust hours before Roberson, 57, was set to be executed on 17 October, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Texas House of Representatives issued a subpoena for him to testify in a hearing that would take place after his execution date. A Travis County judge then issued a temporary restraining order to stop the execution going ahead before the hearing took place. But on Friday, weeks after that subpoena was issued, the Texas Supreme Court said that group of lawmakers did not have the authority to override Roberson's scheduled execution with a subpoena and the execution should now move forward. The lawmakers' last-minute attempt last month followed Roberson pleading for leniency. He also lost multiple appeals in state courts. A Texas parole board rejected Roberson's bid for clemency and Texas Governor Greg Abbott declined to halt Roberson's execution as well. With their subpoena, Texas lawmakers said they planned to address questions surrounding Roberson's case and new scientific developments that could impact his conviction. While scientific experts and Phil McGraw, the television host known as Dr Phil, spoke at the hearing, Roberson did not. The state's attorney general refused to allow Roberson to appear in person at the hearing for security reasons. The legislature also refused to have Roberson appear virtually because he has autism and he is not familiar with modern technology after spending 20-plus years in prison. Among the topics discussed at the hearing was Texas' junk science law, which lets inmates challenge convictions based on later discredited science. Mr McGraw was among the people who said that law might have affected Roberson's case. Roberson was originally sentenced to death in 2003 for the death of his daughter, Nikki Curtis. A post-mortem examination found she died of injuries from abuse but Roberson says his daughter fell out of her bed and when he returned hours later she was not breathing. He took her to an emergency room where she was pronounced dead. While medical staff immediately suspected abuse, Roberson's lawyers argued his daughter was prescribed medicines that are no longer given to children because they can cause serious complications and that, along with the fall, was the cause of her death. In 2023 an appeals court agreed there was insufficient evidence to overturn Roberson's conviction. The Supreme Court declined to hear his case. \"Shaken baby syndrome\" - now called abusive head trauma - is usually diagnosed after finding evidence of retinal haemorrhage, brain swelling and bleeding in the brain. While the diagnosis is broadly accepted by the medical community, a recent report highlighted the need to thoroughly examine other causes before concluding injuries were due to abuse.",
    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nSara Sharif\u2019s father will be in the \u201ccircles of hell for eternity\u201d for what he did to his daughter, a court has heard. Urfan Sharif had previously admitted at the Old Bailey that he was \u201ca cruel father\u201d and that he had beat Sara, but he said that he did not mean to seriously harm her. The 42-year-old has denied murder and causing or allowing the 10-year-old\u2019s death. Sara\u2019s stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have also denied the charges. The court previously heard that Sara had been hooded, burned and beaten during more than two years of abuse before her body was found with dozens of injuries at the family\u2019s home in Woking, Surrey, last year.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Mr Sharif previously accepted \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Sara's death, but denied intending to kill her. On his client\u2019s shock admissions, Mr Mian KC said it came as \u201ca total surprise\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat happened to Sara was awful and that must be the understatement of the year. It was savage, it was brutal. \u201cYou may think quite rightly and deservedly so that that man will never forgive himself. He will be in the circles of hell for eternity. \u201cHe\u2019s undoubtedly guilty of something, but the question for you members of the jury is of what, and that\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to unpack yourselves.\u201d\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nA post-mortem examination found Sara had suffered injuries including \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water before she died on 8 August 2023. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC previously said a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. Mr Mian KC said the fractures Mr Sharif caused were healing by the time of her death and were not a \u201csignificant contributory factor\u201d. Meanwhile, Ms Batool\u2019s barrister Caroline Carberry KC rejected Mr Sharif\u2019s description of the stepmother as a \u201cpsycho\u201d, stating the only psychopath in the courtroom was him. \u201cThe sole perpetrator of the violence that led to Sara\u2019s death is Urfan Sharif,\u201d she told the jury. She pointed to his admissions under cross-examination that he hit her in the face and head repeatedly with a bat and pole two days before her death.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "'I was scammed out of \u00a375k by Martin Lewis deepfake advert'\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Des lost \u00a376,000 after falling victim to a scam advert on Facebook\n\n\"It's quite difficult for me to have to sit in the same room as you\", money saving expert Martin Lewis says as Des Healey, a kitchen fitter from Brighton, walked into the BBC Radio 5 Live studio. Like many other people, Des had fallen victim to a scam advert on Facebook which used a deepfake of Martin along with tech billionaire Elon Musk promoting a non-existent bitcoin investment scheme. Facebook owner Meta, recently announced they would be introducing facial recognition technology to try and crack down on scammers who fraudulently used celebrities in adverts. Martin says he has the \"weird accolade\" of being the most scammed face in Britain. \"I've spent my entire career trying to help consumers, and these criminals, thieves, organised crime people have perverted my reputation,\" he said on his BBC Sounds podcast. Martin tells Des how hard it is to meet somebody who has been taken in by the scam using his image, knowing they \"trusted what I was doing\" to put the money in - ultimately costing Des \u00a376,000.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Martin Lewis speaking in July 2023 when the deepfake scam first came to light\n\nIt was August 2023 and Des had been on Facebook when he spotted the fake advert for the investment scheme, falsely claimed to be fronted by the duo. Artificial intelligence (AI) had been used to manipulate Martin's real voice to make it look like he was doing a TV interview from his house, endorsing an investment scheme by Musk. \"I have witnessed you a few times on TV stating that you never put your name to these things,\" Des tells Martin, \"so why on that particular day it sold it to me, I do not know... I really don't\".\n\nAs a self-employed tradesperson, Des says he saw the advert as an opportunity to \"earn a few extra bob\" before Christmas in a short period of time while his own business wasn't busy. After replying to the advert with his contact details, Des was phoned within 10 minutes and put in touch with a man who claimed to have over 20 years' experience as a financial adviser. Calling himself Carl, he set up an account for Des with Revolut, an e-money firm which has nine million customers in the UK, and took a \u00a31,000 investment. Des was told by Carl \"profitable months\" were coming up and they would \"earn a hell of a lot more\" if they invested his money \"as soon as we can\". Shortly after the initial investment, it appeared that Des had the money returned to his Revolut account, although it is unclear if the screen Des was seeing was in fact that account or a fake page, controlled by the scammer. Trusting Carl, Des then transferred \u00a35,000 into the Revolut account, which was the entirety of his life savings. \"To get the \u00a35,000 back, you had to invest \u00a310,000,\" Des explains, \"I wasn't allowed to withdraw anything until the day that he tells me I can\". The \u00a35,000 Des transferred was then moved out of the Revolut account by the scammer under the guise that it was being invested.\n\nDes took out further loans to cover the money he thought was being invested\n\nDes ultimately ended up taking out four loans with four separate providers totalling \u00a370,000 in order to keep investing. It was then when his son listened to one of the phone calls with Carl and raised concerns after hearing music in the background. He recalls his son asking: \"What bank or call centre would be playing a rap song?\" before warning his dad to go to the police after suspecting \"this isn't right\". Reflecting on how he became victim of a scam, Des says it were as if a \"spell was cast upon me\".\n\nMartin says Des is \"brave and admirable\" for speaking out and telling his story as \"a warning flag\" for others. He adds that scammers are \"psychologically adept at manipulating us, use huge online and intellectual resources in order to steal our money... falling for scams does not make you a mug - makes you a victim, but it doesn't make you a mug\". Offering his tips for avoiding becoming a victim of a scam, Martin says beware of \"urgency\". \"The more urgent and the less people you can tell - the more secret, the more likely it is to be a scam,\" he says.

    "Active Club's members have regular 'training meets' at locations across the UK\n\nAn extreme right-wing group with links to a violent white supremacist collective has been recruiting young men to support its efforts to \"revive\" what it called England's \"warrior culture\" by masquerading as a sports club, a BBC investigation has found. Active Club (AC), which hails World War Two Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as a hero, claims to be \"peaceful and legal\" and focus on male friendship and fitness. However, it is connected to the Rise Above Movement (RAM), which played a key role in the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Extremism expert Alexander Ritzmann said it was using \"the image of a sports club\" to build a \"militia\" intent on \"organised violence\".\n\nThe group claim to be 'focused on the future' but members regularly use Nazi symbology\n\nSince the creation of the first AC in late 2020, it has been estimated that more than 100 clubs have been created in the US, Canada and Europe. The group arrived in the UK in 2023 and has since set up branches in Northern Ireland, Scotland and various regions of England, including the North West, the Midlands, London and East Anglia. An investigation by BBC North West found AC groups in the UK had upwards of 6,000 subscribers on the encrypted social media app Telegram. Telegram has closed the group's England page on at least four occasions, but the latest incarnation - established in mid-August - has almost 1,600 subscribers.\n\u2022 None Images of members wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the term Waffen-SS, the name of the Nazi combat branch during World War Two\n\u2022 None Messages in the wake of the Southport stabbings encouraging people \"not to sit idly by\"\n\u2022 None Guidance on how to avoid police detection in the riots that followed those stabbings Neo-Nazi fighting clubs going by the AC name have been promoted since 2020 by American far-right activist and RAM founder Robert Rundo. Mr Rundo, who was arrested in Romania in 2023 at the request of the US authorities, was one of a number of people accused of rioting and conspiracy in relation to violence across the US in 2017.\n\nOn Adolf Hitler's birthday the group posted that they were celebrating 'the birthday of a hero'\n\nIn a 30-minute telephone call which was secretly recorded by the BBC, a national organiser said AC wanted \"guys who take things seriously\". After questioning the journalist about their ethnicity, fitness, stance on religion, boxing or martial arts ability and ability to drive, he claimed the group, which only recruits men who are \"white and of European heritage\", had \"guys literally everywhere, in every region of England\". \"We're trying to build a mass movement of strong, able-bodied, capable guys,\" he said. He added that the group was \"peaceful and legal\" and wanted to avoid getting shutdown because its members \"couldn't save their families and their friends and their people if they\u2019re in jail cells\". However, messages posted by AC page administrators often included reference to future violent conflict and the need to \"revive the warrior culture of our nation\". One post also called for members to \"get on the streets\u2026 or risk your bloodline being scrubbed from existence\".\n\nThe group emphasise the need to be fit and strong and regularly post images of young men posing\n\nAlexander Ritzmann, a researcher with international organisation The Counter Extremism Project and an adviser to the European Commission\u2019s Radicalisation Awareness Network, said he had \"never seen a network in right-wing extremism grow so fast\". He said AC was a \"sophisticated operation\" and warned if the movement was \"allowed to continue to operate and multiply, the likelihood for targeted political violence will increase\". He said its objective was \"to build some sort of militia that hides behind the image of a sports club, while actually preparing for organised violence\". \"When they commit violence, members and groups will not publish a manifesto afterwards,\" he said. \"This is different from other kinds of extreme right terrorism, where, after the attack a manifesto with all kinds of explanations and theories is published.\" He said if AC did go on to commit violent acts, they would do it \"in disguise\" and would not \"leave any information behind about their real intention\". \"They might want to make this look like a pub fight or a fight on a bus or train... to avoid being exposed,\" he said.\n\nHere their members take a training meeting to Pen y Fan and Corn Du in the Brecon Beacons\n\nIn a piece of research published earlier in 2024, anti-extremism campaign group Hope Not Hate alleged that AC had members who have made bomb threats and marched with the now-banned neo-Nazi terror group National Action. For an act to formally be treated as terrorism by UK authorities, it must meet a series of legal tests in the Terrorism Act 2000, which include it involving serious violence or damage to property, having the aim of intimidation and being for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause. Nick Aldworth, a former detective chief superintendent and UK counter-terrorism national co-ordinator, said AC's UK posts had been \"carefully crafted to intentionally avoid engaging with legislation and they deliberately make calls to action that ask for non-violence\". \"However, their intent is openly contradicted by symbols and imagery implying violent acts and connections to Nazism,\" he said. He said the posts \"stop short of engaging with the Terrorism Act\", but what they did was \"provide a body of evidence to support possible future proceedings should there be other material or actions that cross the offending threshold\".\n\nThe group claim not to do 'political protest' but here members from their North West branch hold banners over a motorway flyover near Liverpool\n\nNigel Bromage, who runs the anti-radicalisation charity Exit Hate after more than two decades in neo-Nazi groups, said the rise of AC in the UK was \"worrying\". He said the organiser who spoke to the BBC was \"talking about building a mass movement, so this isn\u2019t about small numbers\". \"This is about recruiting a large number of people who are going to be physically fit, who are going to obey a lot of rules and regulations and they\u2019re going to be disciplined,\" he said. \"When they\u2019re saying they aren't violent, that\u2019s just a disclaimer to cover themselves. \"Why are they training? Why are they getting fit? Why are they talking about being so serious? \"I think all that is the hint at what they\u2019re really about, which is preparing for their mythical race war that they believe is going to happen.\"\n\nRobert Rundo was said to have been at a 2017 rally in Charlottesville that shocked the US\n\nA Counter Terrorism Policing representative said the scale of the extreme right wing terrorist threat in the UK had \"steadily evolved over the past two decades\". They said their officers' \"increasing casework\" was driven by the \"rising numbers of young people being drawn into the ideology through social media and online platforms\". They said the unit carefully considered \"information and intelligence relating to individuals and groups who promote extreme views\" and should activity \"cross into our area of responsibility... we will act swiftly and without hesitation\". \"There is no doubt that our dependence on digital spaces and networks is also having a profound effect on how extreme views may be formed, how individuals become radicalised, and how they can be recruited to extreme groups or organisations,\" they said. A government spokesperson said religious and racial hatred had \"absolutely no place in our society\". They said the government was \"working to tackle the threat posed by extremist ideologies and respond to growing and changing patterns of extremism across the UK\". AC did not respond to the BBC\u2019s request for comment. Telegram has been approached for comment.",

The death toll has continued to rise since Hurricane Helene - which was later downgraded to a tropical storm - tore across the region. As of Tuesday, 135 people had been confirmed dead across six states, a figure that is expected to grow. At least 40 of those dead were in the west of North Carolina, where 300 roads remain closed, hampering recovery operations, as well as the delivery of much needed food and water.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an old flat red-brick building in Statesville, two hours east of the city of Asheville, North Carolina, was filled with roughly 50 volunteers working to get supplies to the hardest-hit areas of the state. The previously empty room now had stacks of items, ranging from toilet paper to dog food. Several cases of much-needed water were also piled around, towering as high as some of the volunteers. \u201cThis all happened since yesterday at 11:00,\u201d Beth Kendall, who helped organise the efforts, told the BBC, pointing around the small, cramped space covered in piles of donated goods. \u201cThe community response has just been amazing.\u201d Many have seen reports of people still missing, Ms Kendall said. \u201cOn social media, you see lots of people that you know that are still looking for loved ones.\u201d Others shared descriptions of the destruction around their state, stories of neighbours and friends whose livelihoods vanished in a day. \u201cTwo of my wife\u2019s friends live in Asheville. One was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, lost everything. So she moved to Asheville,\" said resident Dennis Spring. \"Looks like she\u2019s wiped out again. \u2026 She has no drinking water. No gasoline. The food in her fridge has rotted.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Inside a donation centre for those impacted by Hurricane Helene\n\nThere was perhaps nowhere harder hit than Buncombe County, an area in the west of the state that includes Asheville. \u201cWe have biblical devastation,\u201d Ryan Cole, an emergency official in the county, told the BBC on Monday. \"This is the most significant natural disaster that any one of us has ever seen.\" Though some of the floodwaters in the region have receded, large swathes of North Carolina remain immobilised by the effects of the storm.\n\u2022 None Why was Hurricane Helene so damaging? The extreme weather has also forced the closure of quartz mines in Spruce Pine, a tiny town about an hour north-east of Asheville, home to the world\u2019s largest-known source of high-purity quartz.\n\nThe Spruce Pine quartz is critical for the production of semiconductors - the foundation of modern computing, necessary for devices like laptops and smartphones to function. \u201cIt does boggle the mind a bit to consider that inside nearly every cell phone and computer chip you\u2019ll find quartz from Spruce Pine,\u201d Rolf Pippert, mine manager at The Quartz Corp, a leading supplier of high-quality quartz, told the BBC in 2019. Mitchell County - which contains Spruce Pine - sits about 96km (60 miles) from Buncombe. It was hammered with more than 2ft (609mm) of rain between Tuesday and Saturday, the Associated Press reported. As of Monday, officials from Mitchell County - where Spruce Pine sits - said in a statement that the county had \"no electricity service, cell service, or internet connectivity\". \"Mitchell County experienced a catastrophic 500-year flood,\" Mitchell County said. \"A good bit of the county infrastructure has been either damaged or destroyed by floodwaters and uprooted trees and downed power lines caused by the storm.\" Both Sibelco and The Quartz Corp said they stopped operations on Thursday, the day before the centre of Helene passed over Mitchell County. In separate statements, both companies said their priority was the health and safety of their employees. In an email to the BBC, Quartz Corp's head of communication May Kristin Haugen said it was \"impossible\" to determine when they would resume operations. \"We are currently assessing the damage at all plants but our ability to operate again will also greatly depend on surrounding infrastructure,\" she said. Despite the closures, Ms Haugen said she was not concerned about shortages in the short or medium term. \"Everybody has learnt through Covid the importance of sizeable safety stocks,\" she said. President Joe Biden is expected to visit North Carolina on Wednesday. The president said he would visit Georgia and Florida \"as soon as possible\" to survey damage there as well.

    "Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said jails \"are on the point of collapse\"\n\nScrapping short prison terms is among a number of ideas set to be considered by an upcoming government review of sentencing. Ministers are interested in proposals to toughen up community orders as an alternative to jail, to reduce the number of offenders in prisons. David Gauke, a former justice secretary and Conservative MP, is the frontrunner to head the work, the BBC has been told by multiple sources. The review will be announced later this month and is expected to make recommendations to ministers next spring. As justice secretary in 2019, Gauke said there was a strong case for scrapping jail terms of less than six months. The BBC has approached Gauke for comment.\n\nShabana Mahmood, the current justice secretary, is known to want to toughen community sentences, which could involve strict conditions and punishments but no time behind bars. Several government sources pointed to advances in technology, such as sobriety tags monitoring alcohol use, that could be used more widely to detain criminals in their homes. One source argued community orders could be tougher than prison because those convicted could not spend \"23 hours a day on drugs\u201d. Ministers are also exploring international examples of reducing crime in Texas and Louisiana, where prisoners can reduce their sentences by earning credits for good behaviour. Officials also pointed to New York, where offenders convicted of drug-related crimes can be sent on a treatment programme. If they complete it, they can have their charges dismissed or reduced. It comes as prisons across the country are struggling to deal with overcrowding after the number of offenders behind bars hit a record high. The Labour government has been exploring options to relieve the immediate pressure on prisons, and has already released some offenders early to free up space. But further emergency measures to stop prisons breaching capacity will be needed next year, sources have told the BBC.\n\nMinisters had hoped the existing early release scheme would buy them 12 months. But the riots this year mean prisons are expected to be full again next summer, before any changes to sentencing can be made. In the long term, ministers want to consider sentencing changes that could reduce crime. Ending or moving away from short sentences could have a particular effect on the number of women in jail, after the Prison Reform Trust found last year that over half (58%) of jail terms given to women in 2022 were for less than six months. Ministry of Justice figures show, external more than half of adults (57%) released from prison sentences of less than 12 months went on to reoffend. One Ministry of Justice source said the government would be encouraging the reviewer \u201cto follow the evidence in terms of how sentencing can cut crime\u201d. \u201cPrisons are creating better criminals, not better citizens,\u201d the source said. A solicitor who was seen as being on the centrist wing of the Conservative Party, Gauke could be viewed as a contentious choice to lead the review. In 2019, he made a series of speeches to call for a shift away from short prison sentences and towards punishment in the community. But Gauke\u2019s successor, Robert Buckland, said he did not believe abolishing short sentences was the right way forward.\n\nDavid Gauke talked about reforming sentencing when he was justice secretary\n\nLord Woolf, a former chief justice of England and Wales, told the BBC he thought Gauke would be a \u201cvery good person\u201d to lead the sentencing review. He said the government should consider launching a public inquiry into the penal system. \u201cI think there is ignorance over what prisons can achieve,\u201d he said. He wrote a report about the Strangeways prison riot in 1990 and has consistenly highlighted the problems of prison overcrowding since then. The retired barrister was one of five former lord chief justices who signed a paper, external that blamed \u201csentence inflation\u201d for the lack of space in prisons. \u201cThe public want longer and longer sentences,\u201d Lord Woolf said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t know that\u2019s self-defeating and it\u2019s a very expensive policy.\u201d Tory leadership contender Kemi Badenoch criticised Labour for \"taking short-term decisions and putting the public at risk\", adding she wanted to tackle the \"root causes\" of prison overcrowding. Robert Jenrick, the other remaining candidate in the leadership contest, said Labour was showing a \"soft-on-crime approach\", and repeat offenders needed \"massively tougher sentences\" to protect the public.\n\nOther previous justice secretaries - including Ken Clarke - have talked up changes to sentencing, only to be stymied by political opposition or the electoral calendar. The previous Conservative government\u2019s attempt to bring in \u201ca presumption that custodial sentences of 12 months or less be suspended\u201d was dropped after the general election was called earlier this year. Speaking at Labour\u2019s conference last month, Lord Timpson, the prisons minister, said community sentences need \u201cto be trusted more by the courts\u201d as an alternative to jail. He suggested previous prisons ministers had not always followed the evidence on \u201cthe best way to stop reoffending\u201d. The government has not made any decisions on potential changes to sentencing policy and will not do so until it has considered the recommendations of the review. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cThe lord chancellor has confirmed plans to launch a review into sentencing that will focus on protecting the public and reducing reoffending. \u201cWe will soon be in a position to announce the terms of reference for this independent review and confirm its chair.\u201d",

    "Alison Kelly was asked why she had not considered concerns raised by doctors about Lucy Letby as a safeguarding matter\n\nThe head of safeguarding at the hospital where Lucy Letby killed babies has told a public inquiry she had \"good intentions\", despite failing to escalate concerns about the nurse. Alison Kelly was director of nursing and executive lead for safeguarding at the Countess of Chester Hospital when Letby murdered seven infants and tried to kill seven others. Senior consultant Dr Stephen Brearey told Ms Kelly in May 2016 that there were concerns about Letby's links to unexplained deaths on the unit, the inquiry heard. However Ms Kelly said at the time she \"just didn't see it as a safeguarding concern\".\n\nThe Thirlwall Inquiry, which is examining how Letby was able to commit her crimes, heard Ms Kelly did not submit a safeguarding referral to the local safeguarding board until March 2018. Giving evidence at Liverpool Town Hall on Monday, Ms Kelly said: \"There was no articulation of the actual issues, nobody had seen her do anything. \"There was terms used like 'gut feeling' and 'drawer of doom' which didn't pinpoint any issues to do with Letby, so on the basis of that, I didn\u2019t have any facts or evidence that I could base my decisions on.\"\n\nConcerns about Lucy Letby (pictured) did not reach the police until 2017\n\nBarrister Nicholas de la Poer KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked why Ms Kelly did not report the concerns raised by doctors to NHS England in July 2016. She said the decision not to do so \"was a really fine balance\" and she saw the concerns reported by doctors as \"hearsay\". However she accepted that, looking back, it was a safeguarding issue and she should have responded accordingly. \"But neither did anybody else,\" Ms Kelly pointed out. \"I take my duties very, very seriously... but I was still relying on the teams from the unit upwards to bring any safeguarding concerns to me and nobody did.\"\n\nMr de la Poer asked her if she was \"deliberately\" trying to \"withhold\" information about someone possibly harming babies. Ms Kelly replied: \"No, as I have said, on reflection there were actions that I didn\u2019t get right but the actions I did take were done with good intentions.\" The inquiry heard Ms Kelly's safeguarding referral came in March 2018, almost a year after Cheshire Police was first called to investigate unexplained deaths and collapses on the unit. Ms Kelly accepted the referral was \"not detailed enough\". Mr de la Poer asked: \"Is it because you had a feeling of hostility towards the consultants and you didn\u2019t think the police investigation was going anywhere?\" Ms Kelly said: \"That's not true.\" Mr de la Poer also suggested things had become \"acrimonious\" between doctors and nurses and that a \"culture of fear\" had developed. \"I would not say a culture of fear,\" Ms Kelly said. \"I think there were challenges with the relationships, I think the trust had broken down and I think on reflection we could have done more to support the clinicians, certainly in a pastoral perspective.\"\n\nDr Stephen Brearey (pictured) said he had mentioned Lucy Letby to director of nursing Alison Kelly in 2015, which she denied\n\nShe agreed that while it was \"not unheard of\" for a nurse to deliberately harm patients, it had not been \"in the forefront of my mind\". Ms Kelly went on: \"I think at the time I was relying on my senior nursing team to give me assurances on Letby, particularly Eirian Powell (unit ward manager) who knew her best. \"I would not know individual nurses on an individual basis.\" She said the consultants were still not expressing clearly why they thought Letby was harming babies, which she found \"quite frustrating\". Last week at the public inquiry, Dr Brearey recalled saying \"oh no, not Lucy, not nice Lucy\" at a meeting with Ms Kelly in July 2015. This followed the discovery Letby had been present for the deaths of three infants weeks earlier. \"That was not said at the meeting,\" she told the inquiry on Monday. \"Lucy Letby\u2019s name was not mentioned at all.\" Ms Kelly told her barrister, Kate Blackwell KC, that she did not hear from Dr Brearey again until May 2016 when he told her a nurse had been moved to day shifts after being linked to a number of incidents. Ms Kelly said the executive team were \"constantly asking questions\" of the clinicians about evidence and had requested more information. She said she learned in March 2017 that consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram had witnessed an incident in February 2016 in which Letby had been beside the cot of a baby girl known as Child K. She told the inquiry: \"We were shocked that we had not been told that before.\" Ms Kelly started her evidence by expressing her condolences to all of the families affected by Letby's crimes. Letby, then 34, was convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others, including two attempts on one infant, between June 2015 and June 2016. She is serving 15 whole life sentences. The public inquiry is now in its 11th week and is expected to sit until early 2025.",
    "Family say Harshita Brella will not be forgotten\n\nThe family of Harshita Brella released a new photo of her as part of their tribute\n\nThe family of Harshita Brella, whose body was discovered in the boot of a car, has said she will never be forgotten.

Ms Brella's husband, Pankaj Lamba, 23, of Sturton Walk, Corby, is being treated by police as a prime suspect and is believed to have fled the country.

On 13 November Northamptonshire Police visited Ms Brella's home on Skegness Walk, Corby, over concerns for her welfare. When officers could not locate her, a missing person investigation was launched, which led to the discovery of her body in the boot of a car on Brisbane Road, Ilford. Earlier this week, police released images of Mr Lamba in the Ilford area and appealed for information from anyone who may have interacted with him. His current whereabouts is unknown. On Thursday detectives investigating Ms Brella's death released a CCTV image of her walking with Mr Lamba on the night they believe she was killed. The picture shows the pair walking together near Corby's boating lake on 10 November.

    "Banks will have the power to pause payments for up to four days to give them more time to investigate fraud, the government has said. Currently, transfers must be processed or declined by the end of the next business day, but the new law will allow an extension of three more days. For years, banks have needed to have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud before being able to investigate but have also faced pressure from customers who want payments to be made instantly. The long-proposed new regulations will come into force at the end of October - later than originally planned.\n\nThe previous government's draft legislation had proposed giving banks the new powers by 7 October, but now they will take effect from the end of the month.\n\nFraud is the most common offence in the country, accounting for a third of all crime in England and Wales. Criminals have stolen billions of pounds through romance scams or by impersonating a genuine trader to trick victims into transferring money. Banks have lobbied for permission to take longer to agree to payments, to allow them to investigate suspicious transfers. The new law will give them time to look at unusual spending patterns, contact a customer, and investigate further before the money is transferred. Ben Donaldson, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, thinks the new law will be used \"fairly sparingly\". \"This is really relevant to cases of investment fraud and romance fraud where there is psychological manipulation of the victim,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nSome groups have said the powers should be used in a careful and targeted way. The Society of Licensed Conveyancers said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that a four- day freeze could be catastrophic for people who are buying a home and have to transfer large amounts of money quickly. But Mr Donaldson said: \"We will only use this power where we\u2019ve got reasonable grounds to suspect it is a fraud.\" Banks will need to inform customers when a payment is being delayed, explain what the customer needs to do in order to unblock the payment and pay compensation if the delay lands the customer with extra charges. The rules will come into force a few weeks after the introduction of a stricter mandatory scheme on fraud compensation. Those new powers, which come into force on Monday, will see fraud victims receiving up to \u00a385,000 in refunds from banks within five days of an authorised push payment scam. The maximum compensation has been reduced from a previous proposal of \u00a3415,000.",

However a jury of nine men and three women at Bristol Crown Court took 18 hours 45 minutes to find the group guilty of both murders. As the jury foreman returned the verdicts none of the defendants showed any reaction from the dock. Members of Mason and Max\u2019s families, who were sitting in the public gallery, cried as the guilty verdicts were given. Other relatives cheered and punched the air.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The mothers of Max and Mason say they are having to learn to live without their sons\n\nSpeaking outside court Leanne Ekland, Max's mum, said: \"Today\u2019s outcome doesn\u2019t change the fact that two families go home without their boys. \u201cBut we can now hopefully begin to process and remember them both and the happy memories both families have of Max and Mason.\" Speaking to the BBC, the boys' mums said that their sons were taken from them in a way that changed their lives forever.\n\nAntony Snook, 45, and Riley Tolliver, 18, were found guilty of murdering the boys\n\nMason's uncle, David Knight, said that his nephew was \"so loving and caring\". He described how with his death, their family will never be complete. \u201cHe will always be in our hearts. \"These animals took away a son, a brother, a nephew, an uncle, and a grandchild,\" he said.\n\nDuring the trial, the court heard Max and Mason each received fatal stab wounds from two machetes. One of the weapons used had a blade length of 42cm (16.5in), while a second was 41cm (16in). The jury was told how Max and Mason had been wrongly identified as being responsible for throwing bricks at a house in the neighbouring Hartcliffe area earlier that evening. The five accused had set off from Hartcliffe heading to Knowle West \u201chell-bent on revenge\u201d, Ray Tully KC told the court. Snook drove down Ilminster Avenue and when the group saw Mason and Max in the street they wrongly believed they had spotted those responsible for the attack. Mr Tully added: \u201cThey were entirely wrong about that. Max and Mason had absolutely nothing to do with any earlier incident and no connection whatsoever with those events.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. CCTV captured the moments before the \"horrific\" stabbing\n\nSnook claimed he \"didn't know\" the teenagers were going to kill the boys when he drove them to the area in his Audi Q2. Mr Tully said the four younger defendants were all armed and argued all five people were responsible for their deaths, which the jury accepted. During the trial, the jury was shown CCTV captured from Mason\u2019s home. It showed the Audi slow down as it passed Max arriving at Mason\u2019s home in Ilminster Avenue shortly after 23:00 BST on the Saturday night. The car then drives out of frame, and Max and Mason leave the house together. Seconds later, the same camera captures the Audi reappearing and four people jump out, chasing the boys down the road, before inflicting the fatal injuries in an attack lasting 33 seconds.\n\nMembers of the community rushed to Max and Mason who collapsed in the street to try and save them before paramedics arrived. The friends died in hospital within 15 minutes of each other in the early hours of Sunday morning. Det Supt Gary Haskins, head of Avon and Somerset Police's major crime investigation team, said: \u201cThese were two boys going about their business just out being friends. \"They were cut down in the prime of their lives. They must have been absolutely petrified. \"They were attacked for no reason whatsoever by individuals they didn\u2019t know. \"Unfortunately in the course of running away from their attackers they sustained injuries... so severe sadly they succumbed to those injuries. They were unsurvivable injuries.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: The moment Antony Snook is arrested for murder\n\nDet Supt Haskins said that within 59 minutes of the attack on Max and Mason, Snook was in custody. \"He [Snook] was the adult who could have changed the course of this incident. \"He\u2019s the one that could have stopped this from happening.\u201d He added: \"These individuals, as a collective, went after those two boys. \u201cThey armed themselves together, they travelled together, they travelled back from the attack together, and they were intent on causing harm to whoever they came across.\u201d Hours after the attack, one of the teenagers was caught on CCTV returning to a property in Hartcliffe carrying a McDonald\u2019s meal. \u201cChillingly for me, what we do know is they even stopped off at McDonald's after attacking those two boys,\u201d Det Supt Haskins said. \u201cI think it speaks volumes really. Two beautiful boys lost their lives, and they went to McDonald's for an early morning breakfast.\u201d",

    "Tesla boss Elon Musk has unveiled the firm's long-awaited robotaxi, the Cybercab, at the Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California. The futuristic-looking vehicle, featuring two wing-like doors - and no pedals or steering wheel - deposited Mr Musk in front of an audience eager to hear details about a project he considers key to Tesla's next chapter. At the event, billed \"We, Robot,\" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides. However, investors have so far not shared his enthusiasm - Tesla's share price fell after markets opened in the US on Friday morning. The value of its stock was down more than eight percent, trading at around $219, at 11:45 Eastern Time (16:45 BST). Meanwhile shares in ride-hailing rivals Uber and Lyft - which have their own autonomous ambitions - were each trading up to 10% higher. Questions are being asked about Mr Musk's prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time \"before 2027\", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines. \"I tend to be optimistic with time frames,\" he quipped during the event. He said the Cybercab - which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (\u00a323,000). However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is. \"It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,\" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester. \"Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn't seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,\" he added.\n\nMr Musk also said he expected to see \"fully autonomous unsupervised\" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year \"with permission where ever regulators approve it.\" But that approval is far from guaranteed. \"It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,\" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University. Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles. By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles. But the research community \"is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,\" Mr Samaranayake said.\n\nThe cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally been due, external for release in August. This summer, in a post on X , external, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important. Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.\n\u2022 None Robotaxi tech improves but can they make money? Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened. Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees. Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a \"Robovan\" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time. The sleek shuttle \"could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,\" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.\n\n\"Can you imagine going down the streets and you see this coming towards you? That would be sick,\" Musk told attendees as Tesla's Robovan rolled into Thursday's event.\n\nAnother analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead. \"Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,\" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out. \"Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,\" Caldwell added.\n\nThe deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiary Cruise being suspended in San Francisco after a pedestrian was knocked down. But the sector continues to expand. Waymo said, external in early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology. Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers. It announced, external a multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August. Chinese tech company Baidu is also reportedly, external looking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China - where the vehicles are active in several cities.",

    "Among the ten thousand men and women marching past the Cenotaph at this year\u2019s Remembrance service, there were six surviving veterans of D-Day. They are now so few that they were outnumbered by the eight former prime minsters, lined up at the annual commemoration in London\u2019s Whitehall. This summer saw a major international event marking the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings, with a small army of world leaders and accompanying media. Here under low, grey autumn skies the six remaining representatives of that huge and heroic moment, the men who were actually there, went quietly past in wheelchairs, with a collective age of 595 years.\n\nIt included 101-year-old Joe Randall, who was aged 20 at D-Day, and who had helped build temporary airfields for the invasion force liberating Europe from Nazism. There\u2019s an immense poignancy to such moments, literally watching history moving out of sight.\n\nWith a military band playing marches, the Spirit of Normandy group were brought past the Cenotaph, part of a long stream of veterans paying their homage, each bringing their own memories as they laid their wreaths. Like a marathon runner determined to cross the line, the very last veteran in the march-past had got out of a wheelchair and was helped on to a walking frame, so he could walk upright past the Cenotaph. It was a slow, stubborn defiance of the passing years, paying his respects his own way, when all the other groups had finished, cheered on by the crowds nearby on the pavement. The youngest contingent was also an emotional moment, in a different way from the ranks of grey-haired ex-military marchers. There were children and young people, from nine years old and upwards, who had lost a parent in the armed forces, brought together by the Scotty\u2019s Little Soldiers charity. All those years of missing a loved one still to come.\n\nBereaved children of armed forces personnel also took part in the march past\n\nThere\u2019s an irresistible sense of the importance of time at such events. Big Ben tolling out across Whitehall. The eleventh hour, the two-minute silence. The band keeping time, the marchers keeping step. The autumn leaves on a Whitehall empty of traffic. For a few moments people even did the unthinkable - putting down their mobile phones. Leading events was King Charles and what was he thinking about his own past year? He has carried on working despite suffering from cancer. On his 76th birthday this week he will be out supporting food banks. As he stared solemnly straight ahead at the Cenotaph, was this his own commitment to public service, duty and endurance? Catherine, the Princess of Wales, was looking down from the Foreign Office balcony, recovering from her own year of health problems. Much has changed since she stood there last year.\n\nThe Princess of Wales watched on from the balcony of the Foreign Office\n\nIt's been a different kind of upheaval this year for the politicians present. Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch were laying wreaths for the first time as prime minister and leader of the opposition. It was a day to remember previous wars, but the new ministers must have been thinking too of the conflicts raging today and wondering about where they could lead. Behind where Sir Keir was standing, a Ukrainian flag was hanging limply over the Foreign Office building, without any wind to make it fly. For all of those present, the royals, the veterans, the political leaders, the crowds, the focal point for Remembrance is the Cenotaph, the memorial standing in the middle of Whitehall.\n\nIt becomes a kind of altar as well as a monument, as Whitehall temporarily becomes a mixture of a church, military parade ground and national shrine. Part of the Cenotaph's power is its plainness. There's almost no ornamentation or religious imagery. That might help it fit in with a modern, eclectic, multi-faith world, with representatives of more than 20 different religions and beliefs gathered around it. The Cenotaph as we see it now is a permanent structure made from Portland stone, but it began as a temporary, wooden structure. There were people who thought it shouldn't be on Whitehall, as it might get in the way. And perhaps that's its point. It's there to get in the way, a sometimes awkward reminder, to make people remember if they were ever tempted to forget.",
    "22 killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut, Lebanon says\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Rescuers dig through rubble in central Beirut after fresh Israeli strikes\n\nTwenty-two people have been killed and 117 injured in Israeli air strikes on central Beirut on Thursday evening, Lebanon's health ministry said. BBC reporters heard loud explosions echoing from the site of the strikes in Bachoura, a small Shia area in the capital. Rescuers were seen digging through rubble at the scene. Ambulances rushed many injured to the American University hospital. Media outlets are quoting security sources as saying that Wafiq Safa - a close ally of assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the apparent intended target of the latest strikes - survived. Neither Israel's military nor Hezbollah have commented.\n\nSmoke and fire rise over Beirut after Israeli air strikes\n\nThe Israeli strikes hit residential buildings in Bachoura's two densely packed neighbourhoods, Nweiri and Basta. They came after two relatively calm days in the Lebanese capital, which has felt unusual after intensive strikes in recent weeks. There was no warning beforehand, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not commented. This is the third time Israel has launched air strikes on the city outside of the southern suburb of Dahieh, where it has struck repeatedly, killing Hezbollah commanders and destroying munitions caches. One woman outside the hospital, who did not want to be named, said she was in the building next-door to the blasts. She said a building which was hit was entirely residential, and about four or five floors high. One of her relatives was being treated for head injuries. The Beirut attack came hours after two Indonesian peacekeepers were injured in southern Lebanon when an Israeli tank fired at a watchtower, according to the UN. An observation tower at a UN base in Naqoura was directly hit, causing the peacekeepers to fall, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said in a statement. Unifil is a peacekeeping mission created in 1978, monitoring hostilities and helping to ensure humanitarian access to civilians in southern Lebanon. The UN said Israeli forces had \"repeatedly hit\" UN positions in the last 24 hours. Israeli soldiers are also accused of deliberately shooting at the cameras and lights at two other Unifil bases. The IDF said its troops had fired from the area around the base after ordering members of the base to remain in \"protected places\". Both peacekeepers were not seriously injured but remain in hospital, the UN said, adding that deliberate attacks on its peacekeepers were a \"grave violation of international law\". In a separate incident, Israeli soldiers fired at a base in Naqoura, \"hitting the entrance to the bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, and damaging vehicles and a communications system,\" the UN added. An Israeli drone was also spotted flying above the bunker entrance. Also in Naqoura, Hezbollah said it fired rockets at Israeli soldiers on the ground and used guided missiles to destroy a tank heading towards the area, leading to casualties. There are now four divisions of Israeli soldiers fighting inside Lebanon as it continues its ground operations against Hezbollah, launched on 30 September. A spokesperson for Unifil told the BBC on Thursday the force was \"alarmed\" and \"deeply concerned\" by the Israeli army's activity in the area where peacekeeping troops are based. Positions hit by Israeli forces are well known as UN sites, Andrea Tenenti said, adding it would be important to have a discussion with Israeli authorities \"to understand what happened\".\n\nUnifil has been operating in southern Lebanon, between the so-called \"Blue Line\" - the unofficial boundary separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights - and the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) to the north. Last week, Unifil refused to leave its positions near the Blue Line after being ordered to do so by the IDF. There are about 10,000 Unifil military peacekeepers in Lebanon, from 50 contributing countries. There are also about 800 civilian staff. Indonesia, where the injured peacekeepers are from, supplies more than 1,200 troops to Unifil, more than any other country. The defence minister in Italy, which contributes more than 1,000 troops to Unifil, said the incidents were \"intolerable\" and must be \"carefully and decisively avoided\".\n\nAround 190 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel by Hezbollah on Thursday, the IDF said. Earlier on Thursday, the Lebanese ministry of public health said an Israeli air strike on the village of Karak in eastern Lebanon had killed four people, injuring 17. Lebanon\u2019s government says as many as 1.2 million people have fled their homes over the past year. Hostilities in the region have escalated steadily since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people. A further 251 were taken to the Gaza Strip as hostages. Since 7 October, nearly 42,000 people have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Different lives - Harris and Trump as you've never seen them before\n\nThroughout an election campaign, US voters are bombarded with images of the two candidates - speaking from podiums, greeting rally crowds and stepping down aircraft stairs. Here's a different visual perspective of who they are and where they've come from. Long before they even knew what the White House was... Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are pictured above both aged three. Decades apart, Democratic presidential nominee Harris spent her early years in Oakland, California, and Republican nominee Trump was raised in the New York borough of Queens.\n\nHarris (left in the left-hand image below) and her sister Maya (centre) were primarily brought up by their Indian mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and social activist. Trump's father Fred Trump was the son of German immigrants and his mother Mary Anne MacLeod Trump was born in Scotland. They enrolled him in the New York Military Academy at age 13.\n\nHarris spent five years at high school in Montreal, Canada, where her mother took up a teaching job at McGill University. She later enrolled in the historically black college, Howard University in Washington DC.\n\nTrump has said his five years at the academy, which began in 1959, gave him military training and helped shape his leadership skills. He later sat out the Vietnam War due to deferments - four for academic reasons and one due to bone spurs.\n\nFrom an early age, Harris was taught by her mother the importance of the civil rights movement and she attended the annual Martin Luther King Jr Freedom March in Washington in 2004. After earning a degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Trump became favoured to succeed his father at the helm of the family business.\n\nHarris returned to California, where she rose swiftly to the top of the state's criminal justice system - taking a job as its attorney general - and used that momentum to mount a successful run for the US Senate in 2016.\n\nAt the same time as she entered Congress, Trump was stepping into the White House for the first time, having stunned the world to defeat Hillary Clinton. Three years later Harris ran a lacklustre presidential campaign, but was picked by the victor of the Democratic race, Joe Biden, to be his running mate. They proved to be the winning ticket, defeating Trump and Mike Pence.\n\nThe end of the Trump presidency and the start of the Biden-Harris term were marked by Covid lockdowns, mask mandates and social unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nHarris struggled at times to make her mark as vice-president, but found her voice in 2022 when the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion. President Biden was happy for her to become the White House champion for the pro-choice movement. It was Trump who had made the Supreme Court more conservative, paving the way for the abortion ruling. During his time in the Oval Office, he also took the US out of the Paris climate accord and took steps to reduce immigration.\n\nHarris's debut international visit as vice-president was to Guatemala in 2021, as part of the responsibility she was given to reduce the numbers of Latin American migrants reaching America's southern border with Mexico. Foreign policy issues that have dominated her time in office include the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump's first visit overseas as president was to Saudi Arabia in 2017. Trump advocates isolationist policies that involve disentangling his country from foreign conflicts and promoting American industry.\n\nHarris is married to Doug Emhoff (pictured below), who campaigns regularly on her behalf. She is stepmother - or \"Momala\", as she says - to Emhoff's children from his first marriage, Cole (left) and Ella (right). Various members of Donald Trump's family have played roles in his political career, though appearances in the 2024 campaign by his wife, former First Lady Melania Trump, have been limited. With his first wife, Ivana, Trump had three children: Donald Jr (second left in the lower picture), Ivanka (second right) and Eric (right). He had a daughter, Tiffany (left), with his second wife, Marla Maples. He married his third wife Melania (third left) in 2005, with whom he has one son, Barron.\n\nHarris entered the 2024 presidential race relatively late in the process, replacing Joe Biden who pulled out. She made history as the first black and Asian-American woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket, and went on to give a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. In the same election, Donald Trump earned the rare distinction of earning a third presidential nomination from his party. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - sporting a bandaged ear after surviving an assassination attempt during the campaign.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Crime up 10% over past year in England and Wales, ONS says\n\nCrime experienced by individuals and households has generally decreased over the last decade.\n\nCrime experienced by individuals and households in England and Wales increased 10% over the past year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Robbery, violence with injury and fraud increased notably in the 12 months up to June 2024 \u2013 returning to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the number of shoplifting offences recorded by police rose by 29% to reach a 20-year high. The ONS cautioned that the previous year \u2013 up to June 2023 \u2013 included periods of Covid restrictions, so it was too early to tell if the change represents a short-term fluctuation or the start of a new trend. The agency also noted that crime has generally decreased over the last decade.\n\nDame Diana Johnson, minister for crime, policing and fire, said \"too many town centres have been decimated by record levels of shoplifting, and communities have been left shaken by rising levels of knife crime, snatch theft and robbery\". \"This cannot continue,\" she said, and vowed to boost policing and toughen the law on shoplifting.\n\nOver the past year, there were an estimated 9.2 million incidents of what is described as \"headline crime\", which includes theft, robbery, criminal damage, fraud, computer misuse, and violence with or without injury. Overall, these offences rose 10%, according to the latest ONS Crime Survey., external Robbery hit an estimated 139,000 incidents, compared with 60,000 the previous year. Violence with injury rose to 562,000 incidents, up from around 376,000. Overall, violence is some two-thirds lower than in the 1990s. Consumer and retail fraud also increased by 19%, reaching approximately 963,000 incidents. There was no significant change in sexual assault offences last year. However, these offences have increased over the last decade \u2013 making them a notable exception to the decline in crime experienced by individuals in that period. Meanwhile, shoplifting offences recorded by the police hit their highest level since records began. A total of 469,788 of these offences were recorded in the year to June 2024, compared with 365,173 in the previous year. Shoplifting offences had already hit a record high in April. Theft from an individual also increased 20%. Among violent crimes, homicides fell 3%, down from 578 to 562. Knife crime was up 4% year-on-year, but remains 2% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Recorded crime figures are not seen as a good indicator of general trends, but are used to give insight into lower volume but higher harm offences reported to the police. The ONS advised that changes to recorded crime may be partly a consequence of changes in police activity and recording practices.",
    "Russian forces took over the city of Volnovakha within weeks of the invasion of Ukraine starting in 2022\n\nA Russian court has sentenced two Russian soldiers to life in prison for killing a family of nine in occupied Ukraine, in a rare example of the country holding its troops to account for alleged war crimes. The entire Kapkanets family were killed in their home in the Donetsk region last year by Anton Sopov, 21, and Stanislav Rau, 28, prosecutors said. Among the victims were two children aged five and nine. The family had been celebrating a birthday at the time, Ukraine's ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said a day after the killings. Some details of the case are unclear, such as whether the soldiers pleaded guilty, as the trial was held behind closed doors due to military secrecy, Russian media reported.\n\nSopov and Rau were convicted of killing 53-year-old Eduard Kapkanets, his wife Tatiana, their adult sons with their wives, a nine-year-old granddaughter, a four-year-old grandson and a more distant relative of the family. Ukrainian officials at the time said they believed the family was murdered for refusing to give up their house to the Russian troops. State news agency Tass reported that the men had been convicted for murder \"motivated by political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred\". The Ukrainian city of Volnovakha was captured by Russian forces just weeks after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Most of the town has been destroyed. Russia denies all allegations of war crimes in Ukraine, despite well-documented evidence to the contrary. This includes the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol which had been sheltering hundreds of people in March 2022 and the killing of hundreds of people in the town of Bucha that month. Russian forces are also accused of running a network of torture chambers across occupied Ukraine, where civilians and prisoners of war are tortured and in some cases killed. The UN has accused Russian forces in Ukraine of rapes, \"widespread\" torture and killings and the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant for Vladimir Putin's arrest.",
    "No tax rises in payslips for 'working people', vows minister\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. No higher taxes in payslips after Budget - Labour\n\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said \"working people\" would not see higher taxes on their payslips following Wednesday's Budget. During the election, Labour promised not to increase National Insurance, income tax or VAT on working people but ministers have since come under pressure to define exactly who that covers. Appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson said the manifesto pledge referred to people \"whose main source of income is the income they earn from going out to work\". She avoided saying if she thought business owners could be considered working people.\n\nConservative shadow science secretary Andrew Griffith accused Labour of coming into government on \"a false prospectus that things would be easy\". \"They essentially lied to the British people in terms of their plans,\" he added. Shortly after coming into power, the Labour government accused the Conservatives of leaving a \"\u00a322bn black hole\" in public finances. In order to avoid cutting public spending, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce some tax rises when she sets out the Budget next week.\n\nThe government is looking at increasing tax on asset sales, such as shares and property, changes to inheritance tax and freezing income tax thresholds. Continuing the previous government's freeze of tax thresholds would see more people move into higher tax bands and could raise an estimated \u00a37bn for the government. Speaking on Sunday, Phillipson said she could not give specific information on what would be in the Budget but said: \"When people look at payslips they will not see higher taxes. \"That is a very clear commitment.\" She added that the government wanted to \"break the doom loop of ever higher taxes on working people and lower growth\". Asked if she, as a minister earning up to \u00a3160,000, counted as a working person, she replied: \"My income derives from my job and I\u2019ll pay whatever taxes are required of me.\"\n\nOn whether a small business owner making a profit of \u00a313,000 would count as a working person, she said she could not go into specific details about \"who may or may not be captured in tax measures that may or may not happen in the Budget\". She said she understood people's frustration but added: \"They haven't got long to wait.\" She reiterated the government's message that ministers faced \"tough choices\" following the \"inheritance\" left by the previous Conservative government. On the same programme, Griffith accused the government of behaving \"at the very least like the worst form of dodgy car hire firm, conjuring up small print that never existed\". The chancellor is also expected to increase the National Insurance rate for employers in the Budget and lower the threshold for when employers start paying tax, in a bid to raise \u00a320bn. Businesses argue that the hike would make it harder to hire staff, hindering the government's aim of boosting growth. The increase could also hit employees if employers opt to reduce pay rises. In addition to offering some hints about what might be in the Budget, the government has also provided details about what spending will be announced. Ministers have pledged \u00a31.4bn to rebuild 50 schools in England a year and \u00a344m to help foster carers and kinship, which is where a child is raised in the care of a friend or family member who is not a parent.\n\nFormer Bank of England economist Andy Haldane said: \"The distinction between working people or not makes no real sense. \"The truth is, it is very unlikely over the course of this Parliament we won't almost all be paying a bit more to close the gap. \"In the land of hard choices, it was always going to be a bittersweet Budget. \"The bitter bit is the tax pill, which will be big, and the sweet part is the investment.\" Before the July general election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank accused both main parties of a \"conspiracy of silence\" over public finances. IFS director Paul Johnson said \"eye-wateringly tough choices\" would be needed if the government wanted to stick to a self-imposed rule that debt must be falling as a proportion of the size of the economy in five years' time.",
    "People across Cuba were left in darkness after Hurricane Rafael caused a blackout\n\nOfficials in Cuba have begun restoring power after the country suffered a nationwide blackout on Wednesday caused by Hurricane Rafael, the country's president says. Hurricane Rafael brought strong winds of up to 185km/h (115mph), causing a shutdown of the country's electricity system for the second time in just weeks. At least 70,000 people were evacuated from their homes before the storm made landfall on Wednesday with warnings of storm surges, flash flooding, and mudslides. No fatalities have been reported.\n\nPresident Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel said the provinces of Artemisa and Mayabeque as well as the capital Havana were severely hit. \"Every step from this point forward is geared towards recovery. Together we will do it,\" he added. The western parts of the country saw widespread flooding and damage to properties brought on by the hurricane. Most of the country's 10 million population are still without power. In Havana, residents used shovels, brooms and buckets to clear rubbish, mud and branches as they assessed the damage on Thursday. Fallen electricity pylons lined the motorway from the capital's west to Artemisa, and towns along the route were strewn with branches and debris from damaged homes. One Artemisa resident said people were having to \"improvise\" to deal with the power cuts. \"If you don't have gas, you have to improvise with coal,\" Elias Perez said. \"Yesterday my wife and I got by with coal. It's a mess, but we have to keep going.\" Last month, millions in Cuba were left without power for four days after issues with the country's old energy infrastructure caused a blackout. That blackout also coincided with Hurricane Oscar, a less powerful category one storm that left a trail of destruction along the island's north-eastern coast. Natalia Martinez, also from Artemisa, said: \"We know how to survive, we're in the dark all the time, you know.\"\n\u2022 None Whole of Cuba loses power as Hurricane Rafael hits",
    "Bowen: US threat to cut Israel military aid is sign of anger at broken promises\n\nThe US says it will be watching to see that Israel's actions on the ground in Gaza match its statements on aid\n\nThe first aid in two weeks has gone into northern Gaza following a letter from the US that gave Israel 30 days to boost humanitarian access, or risk having some military assistance cut off. The letter is the Biden administration\u2019s most detailed public criticism yet of the way Israel has blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza. It was signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and was supposed to be private, until it was leaked to Israeli journalists, external. It is a blueprint for an entirely different approach by Israel to the aid operation in Gaza - expediting it, rather than imposing restrictions. The letter is a line-by-line examination of Israel\u2019s obstruction of aid deliveries \u2013 and the way its forcible relocation of civilians has exposed 1.7 million Palestinians to serious risk of disease. It even challenges Israel\u2019s long-standing attack on UNRWA, the UN agency that looks after Palestinian refugees. The US is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about proposed new laws that would \u201cremove certain privileges and immunities\u201d. An Israeli government minister wants to confiscate UNRWA\u2019s headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem to use the land for a Jewish settlement. The US says it acknowledges Israeli concerns about UNRWA, but that restrictions on it would \u201cdevastate\u201d the humanitarian effort in Gaza and the education and welfare of tens of thousands of Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe letter cannot have made easy reading for its two recipients, Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defence minister, and Ron Dermer, its minister of strategic affairs, who is one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s closest advisers. That is not just because the letter details the \u201cUS government's deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza\u201d. It also contains a reminder, that is also a threat, that US laws restrict arms transfers to countries that block the distribution of American aid. Gallant set the tone of Israel\u2019s approach to humanitarian aid flows to Gaza two days after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. He announced a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of the Gaza Strip. No fuel or food would be allowed in, he said. \u201cEverything is closed... We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\u201d Pressure, not least by the Americans, forced Israel to moderate Gallant\u2019s plan, but the aid coming in has never been consistent or adequate. In recent months, though, restrictions have been tightened, which seems to have prompted the letter. It is a sign of the exasperation and anger inside the Biden administration that Israel has not kept its promises to keep aid flowing into Gaza. The European Union\u2019s chief diplomat and leading human rights groups have already accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. In May, Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, accused Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant of starvation of civilians as part of his application for the court to issue arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Both men rejected the allegation. When Netanyahu spoke at the UN General Assembly in New York on 27 September, he dismissed accusations that Israel was starving Gazans as \u201can absurdity\u201d. He presented a version of Israel\u2019s role in the Gaza aid operation that is diametrically opposed to the one described in Blinken and Austin\u2019s letter. For Netanyahu, the accusations were another sign of antisemitism at the UN and its institutions. Israel, he said, was beset by \u201clies and slanders\u201d. \u201cGood is portrayed as evil, and evil is portrayed as good.\u201d \u201cWe help bring in 700,000 tonnes of food into Gaza. That\u2019s more than 3,000 calories a day for every man, woman, and child in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe hard facts in the US letter are a stark contrast to his emotive rhetoric. Some of them focus on restrictions Israel imposed in September, while Netanyahu made his claims in New York.\n\u2022 None \u201cThe amount of assistance entering Gaza in September was the lowest of any month during the past year\u201d - in other words, since before Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks last year\n\u2022 None The US is particularly concerned by \"recent actions by the Israeli government - including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September\u201d The Americans also criticise the way Israel slows the delivery of aid by imposing onerous rules, and make a number of specific demands:\n\u2022 None They want the removal of the restrictions on the use of closed lorries and containers, and to increase the number of vetted drivers to 400. UN agencies say that a shortage of drivers and lorries has made getting aid into Gaza much harder\n\u2022 None Israel must tighten and speed up security and customs checks. Aid organisations say cumbersome rules are used to slow deliveries down\n\u2022 None The Americans want aid to be funnelled through the port of Ashdod in an \u201cexpedited\u201d route to the Gaza Strip. Ashdod is a modern Israeli container port a short drive north of Gaza. After Israel refused to let it be used, the US spent an estimated $230m (\u00a3174m) on a floating pier for aid deliveries into Gaza that broke up in bad weather before it could make a difference\n\u2022 None Israel should also remove restrictions on deliveries from Jordan Israel argues that Hamas steals aid and sells it at inflated prices. The Americans do not directly engage with that, except in a single sentence that acknowledges there has been \u201cincreased lawlessness and looting\u201d. Front and centre in the letter is Israel\u2019s squeeze on Gaza. Their criticism extends way beyond the mechanics of getting aid into Gaza. It demands an end to the isolation of northern Gaza, where ultra-nationalists in Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet want to replace Palestinians with Jewish settlers.\n\nThe UN's humanitarian chief says all essential supplies are \"running out\" in Gaza\n\nConcern about northern Gaza has increased since Israel started its current offensive there. The army\u2019s actions have resembled parts of a plan put forward by a group of retired officers, led by Giora Eiland, a major-general who used to be Israel\u2019s national security adviser. Eiland says he wanted a deal to get the hostages back and end the war early on. But as that didn\u2019t happen, he believes more radical action is necessary. Israel has already separated northern Gaza from the south with a corridor along Wadi Gaza that bisects the territory. Eiland told me that his plan was to open evacuation routes for a week to 10 days so that as many of the 400,000 or so civilians left in the north leave. Then the territory would be sealed, all aid supplies cut, and everyone left inside would be considered a legitimate military target. A version of the plan appeared to be in place at Jabalia camp in the north, after it was sealed off by Israeli troops, tanks and drones. The Blinken-Austin letter insists that there can be \u201cno Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians from northern to southern Gaza\u201d. Aid agencies should have \u201ccontinuous access to northern Gaza\u201d and should be able to enter it direct from Israel rather than taking the hazardous and often deadly route from the south. Orders to evacuate must be cancelled \u201cwhen there is no operational need\u201d. Israel has forced 1.7 million civilians, many of whom fled northern Gaza, into a narrow strip of land along the coast between al-Mawasi and the town of Deir al-Balah, where the letter says \"extreme overcrowding exposed the civilians to a high risk of contracting serious diseases\". The Americans want the pressure to be eased, for civilians to be allowed to move inland before the winter. BBC Verify has established that Israel has also bombed what it says are Hamas targets in an area it calls a humanitarian zone.\n\nAbout 1.7 million Palestinians are sheltering in the Israeli-designated al-Mawasi \"humanitarian area\"\n\nThe letter had immediate results. For the first time since the beginning of October, Israel has allowed in convoys of lorries carrying aid, though not yet on the scale requested by the US. Whether the letter can end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, particularly in the absence of ceasefire, is another matter. Israel has been given 30 days to remedy matters. The US presidential election happens within that time frame. Before polling day, the US would not restrict weapons shipments to Israel, especially given the fact that the Israelis are on the brink, potentially, of a much wider war with Iran. If Vice-President Kamala Harris wins, the Biden administration will be able to keep up the pressure on Israel until the inauguration in January. It is likely to be a different story if former President Donald Trump gets his second term. Based on Trump\u2019s previous four years in office, Netanyahu is likely to feel he has much more freedom to do what he wants as he runs down the clock on Joe Biden\u2019s time in the White House. Biden has been widely criticised, in his own Democratic Party and further afield, for not using the leverage that should come with America\u2019s position as Israel\u2019s most vital ally. Without US military and diplomatic support Israel would struggle to fight its wars. The letter looks like a serious attempt to impose pressure. In the last year of war, Netanyahu has often ignored US wishes. A turning point came at the UN General Assembly in late September, when the US, UK and other allies of Israel believed they had talked Israel into accepting a 21-day truce in Lebanon to make time for diplomacy. Instead, Netanyahu\u2019s speech doubled down, rejecting a truce and escalating the regional war. From his hotel in New York, he ordered the assassination of the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. Some senior Western officials complain that the Biden administration has been \u201cplayed\u201d by Netanyahu. The letter is a belated attempt to redress the balance. Biden has been convinced he can best influence Israel by offering unconditional support. He advised Israel after 7 October not to be blinded by rage, as he said America was after the al-Qaeda\u2019s 9/11 attacks. But his wishes have often been ignored by Netanyahu. Whether or not Israel listens to America\u2019s demands on Gaza, as Biden enters his last lap as president, it is clear that his attempt to stop the spread of the Gaza war across the Middle East has failed. And as for the letter, it will be too little, too late for all those civilians in Gaza who have suffered, and for those who have died, as the result of months of restrictions in humanitarian aid imposed by Israel.",

    "'I can't say what my face will do in two hours'\n\nAmy Green, from Leeds, has suffered from Bell's palsy since it first struck seven years ago\n\nWhen Amy Green first saw Tulisa Contostavlos on I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, she said it was \u201clike looking at a mirror image\u201d of herself. Though the two women look different, they have both suffered from Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition affecting about 100,000 people in the UK. Amy quickly recognised how Bell\u2019s palsy had affected Tulisa's face, saying \"there's volume that lacks in her face, which is very similar to mine\". Amy, 42, said she welcomed the star's appearances on prime-time TV as it would help raise awareness. \u201cYou can't get a bigger platform than I'm a Celebrity to talk about things, so it's wonderful she's in there,\" she said. Tulisa, 36, first spoke about having Bell's palsy on Olivia Atwood\u2019s So Wrong It's Right podcast, during which she said her initial attack had happened when she was 24. She explained she was given steroid injections and left with swelling before her face dropped and remained drooped for seven months, during which time she said she hid in her house. She added she had since undergone a series of surgeries to balance her face. However, appearing on the current series of I'm a Celebrity, Tulisa has received criticism about her appearance from some viewers, prompting broadcaster Rylan Clark to urge people on X not to \"make jokes about her\".\n\nFor Amy, from Leeds, the condition hit seven years ago after a stressful period at work. \u201cI was exceptionally busy. I was doing 60-plus hours a week and I had a second job. Something had to give - and it was me,\" she explained. She said she first noticed something was wrong while at the hairdresser one day. \"I remember looking at myself in the mirror and thinking I didn't feel like I was there. I'd felt a little unwell in the run-up to it. I'd had like headaches and pain. \"I\u2019d gone to bed on the Sunday night thinking I just needed some rest. Then I woke up with a really droopy face and my eyes sort of wide open. \"It got progressively worse throughout the day, so my face dropped a lot more. My speech started to be slurred.\" Amy said her doctor soon diagnosed her with Bell's palsy. It took her more than 18 months to recover, and she said that even seven years later there were still areas of her face she cannot move. \u201cI think I was one of the unlucky ones. It doesn't always take as long to recover for many people,\" she said. \u201cSometimes I could go to bed and it looked one way, and then I'd wake up and it looked a completely different way the next day.\u201d\n\nAmy says her parents has been very supportive throughout her experience\n\nAccording to the NHS, external, Bell's palsy is a condition causing temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles in one side of the face, with symptoms varying from person to person. The weakness on one side of the face can be described as either a partial palsy, a mild muscle weakness, or a complete palsy, which is no movement at all. It can also affect the eyelid and mouth, making it difficult to close and open them. Amy said that while she understands why Tulisa chose to undergo several bouts of surgery to deal with the effects of Bell's palsy, she had decided against them. \u201cI was offered Botox, but I decided not to take it because I don't think it's the right thing. \"You're trying to match your other side all the time and I can't tell you what this side of my face is going to do in two hours, let alone in two days. \u201cSo, I chose physical therapy to try and loosen up this side of my face and try to encourage it to come back with stretches.\u201d Amy said the experience of having Bell's palsy had changed her life in many ways: she cannot drink unless it is through a straw; she has to be more careful about getting rest; and she said eating fast food can be a challenge. \"One time I was trying to go to McDonald's with nieces and nephews,\" she said. \"I tried to eat something there and I had to bring my own cutlery so I could kind of cut it up and, like, eat a burger. \"But food was never going to stop me. I'm far too much of a foodie.\"\n\nAmy said she was lucky to have a big support network - including help from charity Facial Palsy UK - but colleagues and strangers have not always been so kind and, like Tulisa, she has also experienced negative feedback after going on TV. \"I appeared on TV during the election a couple of years ago. Every single time I go on TV, you can guarantee somebody says something about my face,\" she said. \"And I just think sometimes it's quite cruel, isn't it, that people think they can have that conversation?\" However, Amy said she thinks having Bell's palsy had made her a stronger person. \"I think it's made me more empathetic. It's opened up my eyes, pun intended, to understand disabilities for other people.\" Amy said when \"everything kind of fell apart\", she had decisions to make - and she concluded: \"I can help and I make that a bit better for others.\" \"You know, I'll wallow for a while and then pull my big girl socks up and get on with it,\" she explained. \"So, yeah, it's been tough, but it certainly could have been worse.\" Meanwhile, Amy said she can only praise Tulisa for going on I'm a Celebrity and raising awareness about a condition which affects so many people. \"It's kind of really nice to have that,\" she said. \"I think it's just good they give a platform to things like that. I wish her all the best.\" Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here, external.",

In all but two states, the presidential candidate with the most individual votes from the residents there wins all the state\u2019s electoral college votes. If both candidates win all the states that history - and the polls - suggest are almost certain to vote for them, it will leave Kamala Harris 44 votes short of victory and Donald Trump looking for 51 more votes to become president. The swing states hold 93 votes between them. Both candidates will need to win at least three swing states to get them over the line. There are many different swing state combinations that could take either past 270 - but some are more likely than others. In the scenarios below, we look at how both candidates might get across the line - and what happens if neither of them does.\n\nThe three swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are part of the Rust Belt \u2013 former heartland of the US manufacturing industry. That industrial heritage means many voters in these states have traditionally been union members with a long history of voting for the Democrats \u2013 and the Democrats have taken all three states in seven of the last eight presidential elections. When they did flip for Donald Trump in 2016, they all flipped together. So history would suggest that one candidate will likely take all three states \u2013 and taken together they provide a sizable block of votes. If all the other states vote as expected, and Kamala Harris can win all three Rust Belt states, then she will win the election. If Donald Trump swept up these three states again, he would still need to pick up at least one state elsewhere. For Harris the key to these states \u2013 as with many states across the country \u2013 is to pile up votes in and around the cities by ensuring that black, minority and college-educated voters turn out on election day along with middle-class voters in the suburbs \u2013 particularly white women. Trump's strength in these states is the opposite. He won the 2016 election by amassing huge winning margins in the rural areas of these states \u2013 appealing to those voters outside the cities. Trump is hoping he can find even more votes in rural areas this year and his campaign is focusing on persuading younger men who may have never voted before to get to the polls. If they turn out in large numbers, it could further bolster his white working-class vote in the Rust Belt. Pennsylvania is the biggest prize of the 2024 swing states with 19 electoral votes. If Kamala Harris can win Pennsylvania plus one more from this Rust Belt group, she leaves Donald Trump needing close to a clean sweep of all the other swing states. With Pennsylvania, Harris could pass 270 by winning just three swing states overall. Nevada doesn't have enough electoral college votes for this scenario, but Pennsylvania and any other two would be enough. This is Pennsylvania's presidential election. The other states just live in it. According to some projections, the candidate who wins Pennsylvania has upwards of a 90% chance of winning the White House. It's that important. Pennsylvania, in a way, is a microcosm of the United States. It has big cities dominated by Democrats and Republican-friendly rural areas. Its demographic makeup is similar to the country overall. It has new technology companies and old industries; energy extraction and agriculture. A candidate can't be a one-trick pony and win in Pennsylvania. It is the place that both campaigns have been investing the most time and resource. And polls almost universally show the state sitting on a knife's edge.\n\nThe three swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are part of the Rust Belt \u2013 former heartland of the US manufacturing industry.

And polls almost universally show the state sitting on a knife's edge.\n\nThe states in the southern US are often referred to as the Sun Belt for the obvious reason that they have a hotter climate than those in the north. There are four swing states in the south at this election: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Between them they could deliver 49 electoral college votes to a candidate who won all four. As with the Rust Belt, Harris would likely become president if she won all four. If Trump swept all the swing states in the Sun Belt, he would still need to pick up one more state. However, though the margin of victory would be more comfortable than sweeping the Rust Belt, it feels an unlikely path to victory for Harris as the Democrats haven\u2019t won all four of these states since Harry Truman was elected in 1948. Unlike the Democrats, Republicans do have a history of sweeping these states. Since the Civil Rights Act upended the political map in the 1960s: Presidents Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Bush Jr each won all four of these states at one or more elections. There are two key groups that could help decide the results in the Sun Belt: black and Latino voters. In both Georgia and North Carolina a large percentage of eligible voters are black. Harris will hope she can match Joe Biden\u2019s performance with those voters; he won 92% of all black votes across the US in 2020, but some recent polls have suggested Harris is struggling to hit similar numbers. Arizona and Nevada have fast-growing Latino populations and for a long time, Democrats assumed an increase in Latino voters in any state would automatically increase their chances of winning. But Donald Trump surprised many by making in-roads with Latino voters at the last two elections, with his perceived strength on the economy being particularly attractive. However, Republicans are concerned that widely-reported comments about Puerto Ricans and other Latinos by speakers at Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, which leant heavily on racist stereotypes, could undo some of those gains. Donald Trump held North Carolina in the last two elections and it wasn\u2019t considered a swing state until Kamala Harris took over the Democratic ticket. If Trump failed to hold North Carolina, his route to the White House becomes much harder as he would need to win at least two of the Rust Belt states and two more in the Sun Belt. The state has only voted for the Democratic candidate once since 1980 \u2013 for President Obama in 2008. But there is a chance Harris could take it if she can inspire black voters to turn out, as they did for Obama, and she picks up votes from the recent influx of college-educated voters. Campaign aides for Harris believe that around 10% of voters in all seven battleground states are still persuadable, and they haven't given up on changing hearts and minds in an election where the slightest shift in a swing state could have major electoral implications. In North Carolina, a state Democrats still believe they can flip despite an uphill battle, Harris has focused on Republican college-educated, suburban women who are turned off by the former president's rhetoric. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has grown more confident about Georgia and North Carolina, and the former president has also set his sights on becoming the first Republican presidential nominee to win Nevada since George W Bush won it in 2004.\n\nThe states in the southern US are often referred to as the Sun Belt for the obvious reason that they have a hotter climate than those in the north.

However, Republicans are concerned that widely-reported comments about Puerto Ricans and other Latinos by speakers at Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, which leant heavily on racist stereotypes, could undo some of those gains. Donald Trump held North Carolina in the last two elections and it wasn\u2019t considered a swing state until Kamala Harris took over the Democratic ticket. If Trump failed to hold North Carolina, his route to the White House becomes much harder as he would need to win at least two of the Rust Belt states and two more in the Sun Belt. The state has only voted for the Democratic candidate once since 1980 \u2013 for President Obama in 2008. But there is a chance Harris could take it if she can inspire black voters to turn out, as they did for Obama, and she picks up votes from the recent influx of college-educated voters. Campaign aides for Harris believe that around 10% of voters in all seven battleground states are still persuadable, and they haven't given up on changing hearts and minds in an election where the slightest shift in a swing state could have major electoral implications. In North Carolina, a state Democrats still believe they can flip despite an uphill battle, Harris has focused on Republican college-educated, suburban women who are turned off by the former president's rhetoric. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has grown more confident about Georgia and North Carolina, and the former president has also set his sights on becoming the first Republican presidential nominee to win Nevada since George W Bush won it in 2004.\n\nAt the last two elections the winning candidate - Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 - won six of the seven 2024 swing states. Trump missed out on Nevada by only 27,000 votes, and Biden lost in North Carolina by around 75,000 - having improved on Hilary Clinton\u2019s total there in 2016 by over 100,000 votes. A small difference in turnout could have seen Trump or Biden sweep all these states, and at this election it's possible either candidate could do the same. Neither of them has a decisive lead in the polls in any of the seven swing states at the moment but the margin of error in each poll means one of them could be further ahead than it appears. If polls have underestimated support for Trump like they did in 2016 and 2020 then he could well end up winning all seven swing states and even picking up another state or two elsewhere in the country. But equally, if pollsters' assumptions about turnout are wrong and enthusiasm within the Democratic Party helps bring record numbers of Kamala Harris supporters out to vote in key states, then she could end up with a winning map that looks like Biden's in 2020. The polls suggest this could be one of the closest US elections in history - but should we be surprised if it isn't? Not really. In fact, we should expect the polls to be slightly out because they\u2019re designed to broadly explain how the public feels about a candidate, not predict the result in a swing state by less than a percentage point. The average gap between Harris and Trump across all seven swing states at the moment is just over one percentage point. The average state-level polling error in the last six presidential elections was just over four points. Keep that in mind when you're thinking about possible outcomes in this election.\n\nAt the last two elections the winning candidate - Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 - won six of the seven 2024 swing states.

The most frequently discussed of these is Kamala Harris failing to pick up the single vote she is expected to win in Nebraska. Nebraska is one of only two states which assign some of their electoral college votes to the winners in individual districts, rather than giving all of them to the candidate with the most votes in the state as a whole. Without that single vote from Nebraska\u2019s second district, the Democrats most likely path to victory - winning all three Rust Belt states - would result in a tie instead. The president is then decided by a vote in Congress with each state getting a single vote - unlike the electoral college where states with more citizens get more votes. This would almost certainly result in Donald Trump being elected president, as the Republicans tend to win more states at each election, despite the Democrats receiving more votes in total across the country at seven of the last eight presidential elections. There are scenarios that would result in a draw without the Republicans winning Nebraska\u2019s second district. For instance, if Trump swept the Rust Belt and Harris took all the Sun Belt except Nevada they would finish with 269 votes each. But it seems unlikely to happen, because if Harris was winning like that in the south, you would expect her to also sweep up Nevada. Similarly, Trump winning only the three states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina would result in a tie. However, if his political message proved that popular in Michigan and Pennsylvania, wouldn\u2019t he also take Wisconsin? Then again, this election is so close in the polls that maybe the swing states could follow a pattern no-one expected.\n\nThere are combinations of states that could leave the final result with Harris and Trump tied on 269 votes each.

    "The plant which already employs 350 people will have another 130 jobs added\n\nKellogg's has said it will create 130 jobs at Europe's \"largest cereal factory\" in north Wales. Kellanova, the company which manufactures the cereal, has announced it is investing \u00a375m at its site in Wrexham. The plant, which employs 350 people, produces well-known brands including Special K, All-Bran and Fruit 'n Fibre. Kellanova will move production of Corn Flakes and Crunchy Nut from its Greater Manchester plant, doubling the Welsh factory's capacity to 1.5 million boxes a day.\n\nIt comes after Kellanova announced in May that it would close its Trafford Park factory, meaning 360 people would lose their jobs. The Wrexham factory was opened by Kellogg's in 1978 and Kellanova said this development meant the biggest single investment in the UK for 30 years, making it the largest cereals manufacturing plant in Europe.\n\nUK managing director Chris Silcock said: \"By bringing together the manufacturing of all our major breakfast cereals at one site in Wrexham, we can make significant leaps forward in the efficiency, quality and sustainability of our operation. \"We look forward to making Wrexham the home of our cereal production for many generations to come.\"\n\nKellogg's has had a factory in Wrexham since the 1970s\n\nThe company claims the development will reduce its CO2 emissions by 11% with the use of two new production lines using artificial intelligence. It also said more raw materials, such as rice, could be used, delivering a \"10-fold reduction\" in food waste, alongside new packaging lines and upgraded production lines. Wrexham MP Andrew Ranger said he was \"delighted\" about the investment. He added: \"Our skilled workforce is one of Wrexham\u2019s greatest assets and I am confident that their expertise and dedication will contribute to the success of this venture. \"I look forward to a prosperous partnership and the positive impact this investment will have for Wrexham.\"",
    "Why the King can't say 'sorry' for slavery\n\n\"None of us can change the past,\" the King said to Commonwealth leaders\n\nThe \"most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate\", King Charles III said this week to Commonwealth leaders in Samoa, as arguments about reparations and apologies over the slave trade rumbled once again. That's become an occupational hazard for the Royal Family, as it can't shake off questions about the long shadow of historic links to slavery. It's even more pointed in a forum such as the Commonwealth summit, with leaders representing some of the countries most affected by the legacy of colonialism and slavery.\n\nBut even if the King had a personal belief that there should be a symbolic apology or a commitment to reparations, he wouldn't have been able to deliver it. Monarchs speak on the advice of ministers - and on a question of such political sensitivity, his speeches will have to stay within the boundaries of government policy. In other words, he has to stick to the script. A week ago, Downing Street signalled quite clearly that there would not be an apology or a deal on reparations from the UK at the summit in Samoa. That meant that whatever the King might privately think, anything he said about such historic wrongs would reflect the line set by the government. \"None of us can change the past,\" the King said diplomatically, neatly aligning with Prime Minister Keir Starmer's line that we \"can't change our history\". That hasn't stopped the King from going very close to the wire.\n\nPM meets HM: It's the government that decides how much the monarch can say\n\nIn Kenya last year, the King spoke of his \"greatest sorrow and regret\" at the wrongdoings of the colonial era. In language stronger than in Samoa, he spoke of the \"abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans\" during their struggle for independence. But in keeping with government policy, there was nothing that could be pinned down as an explicit apology. The use of \"sorrow\" carefully avoids saying sorry. It was also used by the then-Prince Charles at the previous Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda. Interestingly, it mirrors the closest a UK prime minister has come, when Tony Blair in 2007 formally voiced his \"deep sorrow and regret\" over Britain's part in the slave trade. At the time, there were calls for Blair to go further, but he later said he had said sorry. Although expressing it as \"sorrow\" includes the emotion, it avoids the liability and expectation of compensation that might come with \"sorry\".\n\nAs head of state, the King is the symbolic focus of calls for such redress, whether that's financial reparations or some other ways addressing of historic wrongs. That's not going to go away. That's awkward but he'll take that in his stride, as it's a political decision that he can't change and reparations for the past seem unlikely when current UK budgets are under intense stress. But there's also the more complicated question of how much the monarchy, as both a family and an institution, might have a closer responsibility. For example, the Royal African Company, founded in the 17th Century under royal patronage, has been claimed as transporting more enslaved people from Africa across the Atlantic than any other company. But history, like people, can be full of contradictions.\n\nWhen it came to Britain's pioneering efforts to abolish slavery, in the early 19th Century, research by historian Prof Suzanne Schwarz found the Royal Family itself was divided. The nephew of George III, the Duke of Gloucester, was one of the most important campaigners to abolish slavery - a tireless opponent of the cruel trade and a supporter of the Royal Navy's efforts to intercept slave ships. But before the royals feel the clouds lifting, George III's son, the future William IV, was one of the most enthusiastic defenders of slavery. There's a sparkling silver service still in the possession of the Royal Collection Trust, known as the \"Jamaica Service\", which was given to the future William IV by those in Jamaica who wanted to thank him for his efforts to protect the slave trade. Before becoming King, William IV was Duke of Clarence - and Clarence House, a royal residence, is named after him.\n\nKing Charles has previously spoken of his \"sorrow\" at the slave trade\n\nThere have been attempts in other countries to draw a line under the question of slavery. The Dutch King delivered a formal apology, in a move co-ordinated with the country's prime minister. But for King Charles and other senior royals, it's a question that continues to hang in the background, particularly when they visit a former colony or a place where the slave trade had an impact. Prince William and Catherine's trip to the Caribbean in 2022 was dogged by rows over whether their visit had too much of the look and feel of a colonial visit. Any trip planners must look at traditional dancers and garlands and start having nightmares about how it might come across. But the King, who has been walking this political tightrope for many decades, steered a careful path in Samoa. \"None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure,\" he said. And in a speech that was widely seen as being about the legacy of slavery - he never once actually referred to slavery at all.\n\u2022 None We must learn lessons from history, King tells Commonwealth",

    "Government ministers are considering a smacking ban for England, the Department for Education has confirmed. Smacking bans have already been brought in by devolved governments in Scotland, and Wales, as well as Jersey, outlawing the use of physical violence to punish children. Plans for similar laws in England were rejected by the previous Conservative government as recently as last year - but Labour ministers are now \"looking carefully\" at whether more can be done on the issue. The move comes following fresh calls for a ban by the Children's Commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza, after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif.\n\nA court heard Sara was hooded, burned and beaten over a two-year period as her father, stepmother and uncle stand trial for her murder, which they deny. Dame Rachel said a ban on any type of corporal punishment, including smacking, hitting, slapping, and shaking, could stop lower level violence from escalating. \"If we are serious about keeping every child safe, it's time England takes this necessary step,\" she posted on X, external. \"Too many children have been harmed or killed at the hands of the people who should love and care for them most.\" In England and Northern Ireland it is legal for a carer or parent to discipline their child physically if it is a \"reasonable\" punishment - but the Children Act 2004 made it illegal to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm. Dame Rachel said the experience of Scotland and Wales \" has taught us we need to take that step in England too\" and \"now is the time to go further\". The NSPCC and Barnardo's have long called for an English smacking ban and two-thirds of English people polled by YouGov in March last year said physically disciplining a child is not acceptable. The previous government argued parents should be trusted to discipline their children. However, a Department for Education spokesperson told the BBC that stance has changed. \"Any form of violence towards a child is completely unacceptable, and we are looking closely at the legal changes made in Wales and Scotland as we consider whether there is any more we could do in this area,\" they said. \u201cWe are already supporting teachers, social workers and all safeguarding professionals to spot the signs of abuse or neglect more quickly, including with our mandatory framework for safeguarding children.\u201d",
    "NASUWT members on the picket line during previous strike action\n\nUnions representing the majority of teachers in Northern Ireland are to ballot their members on strike action. The NASUWT, INTO and UTU have said they are holding the vote due to the lack of \"a satisfactory pay offer for 2024-25\". A fourth teaching union in Northern Ireland, the NEU, is also going to ask its members if they should hold a formal ballot for industrial action. The education minister said it was \"with disappointment\" that he received the notification from the unions of their intention to ballot members on strike action, adding that any future pay award must be \"affordable\".\n\nHealth unions also recently raised the possibility of strikes over pay. The pay dispute could also spread to include the Northern Ireland Civil Service. BBC News NI has seen an extract from an executive document which underpinned Monday's budget reallocation, known as a monitoring round. It says that there is only enough money to offer civil servants a 3% pay increase for 2024/25. It adds that trade unions have already indicated that would not be an acceptable award. There is a warning that a 3% offer would be \"particularly difficult to defend if awards to other pay groups are materially higher\". The executive document also notes that the pay guidelines for the civil service in Great Britain will allow \"an average pay award of up to 5%\" there.\n\nTeachers in England received a 5.5% pay rise for 2024-25 from the government in September. It was funded by an additional \u00a31.2bn from the UK government. Despite the fact that it is more than halfway through the 2024-25 financial year, no pay deal for teachers in Northern Ireland has yet been agreed. The teaching unions in Northern Ireland accepted a previous pay deal in March 2024, but that was a backdated one covering the years from 2021 to 2024. There had been stalemate over a pay rise for teachers for three years as inflation rose, leading to strikes and other industrial action.\n\nCivil servants and teachers striking in 2023 at Belfast City Hall\n\nIn a joint statement, the NASUWT, INTO, UTU and NEU said that they had made it clear to Education Minister Paul Givan that \"he needs to make a satisfactory offer on pay\". The INTO's Mark McTaggart said that teachers in Northern Ireland were \"once again the least well paid across these islands\". \"Teachers have a right to receive a salary that truly reflects their value to society,\" he said. \"The continued failure by those who hold the purse strings to provide this has the potential to have a devastating effect on the life chances of the children and young people in their care.\u201d Meanwhile, Justin McCamphill from the NASUWT said that inflation \"has not gone away\". \u201cTeachers in Northern Ireland have watched since the summer as their counterparts in the rest of the UK have received significant pay increases for this academic year and are telling us that they are fed up with being left behind,\" he said.\n\nJacquie White said the teaching profession seems to have been downgraded\n\nJacquie White from the UTU said that the lack of progress on pay was causing \"grave concern.\" \u201cFor too long the profession here seems to have been downgraded,\" she said. \"Indeed it took years of campaigning and eventually strike action before our teachers received a pay deal which put them in line with their colleagues in GB.\" Pauline Buchanan from the NEU said that teachers had found \"themselves once again as the lowest paid members of the profession across these islands\". The Department of Education (DE) received an additional \u00a3171m in the recent Executive monitoring round in which money is re-allocated to departments. At almost \u00a33bn, education has Stormont's second biggest departmental budget behind Health. But officials from the department recently told MLAs that they were facing a gap of \u00a3190m to pay for \"inescapable pressures,\" including the rising costs of running schools, supporting pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and funding a pay deal for teachers.\n\nPaul Givan said he had hoped that a pay agreement reached in March would increase \"stability\"\n\nEducation Minister Paul Givan said he was \"currently considering the implications of the additional financial allocation\" to his department in the October monitoring round. He said he had hoped that an agreement reached in March on teachers\u2019 pay for 2021-24 would \"allow us to increase stability and work together to improve the educational experience of our children\". Givan said any proposed award for teachers must be \"affordable\", adding that this was \"difficult given the current financial pressures\". He said he would continue to work to seek a resolution.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that NI Water unions are in the process of balloting their members over industrial action. The GMB and Unite unions have told the Nolan Show they are in the process of balloting their members over a \"failure\" to address a 2023/24 pay award in line with other public sector employees. Both ballots close in the first week of December.",
    "Great Ormond Street Hospital is one of the world's leading children's hospitals\n\nAn investigation into disgraced bone surgeon Mr Yaser Jabbar has been widened to cover five London hospitals, as 721 patients' care is being reviewed. His work at St John and St Elizabeth Hospital and Cromwell Hospital, both private, is now being looked into in addition to the Portland Hospital and two NHS hospitals, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. A leaked extract of a damning report, by the Royal College of Surgeons, concludes children had \"incorrect\" and \"unsuitable\" orthopaedic surgery under Mr Jabbar's care at GOSH. This left many with life-altering conditions and suffering from severe harm.\n\nThe report has finally been released to some patients' families and BBC News has obtained a copy. It highlights a number of issues in the complex lower-limb reconstruction unit at GOSH, including \"a lack of a cohesive, united and functional team and department\" compounded \"by a lack of direction and effective management and leadership\". The review team also found \"serious concerns in relation with the working culture\", with staff saying the working environment was \"toxic\" and they had been \"dismissed and subject to unacceptable and unprofessional behaviours, including verbal aggression\". Staff were also \"upset about the standard of care\", which was \"unsatisfactory\" in some cases, the report said. And staff in operating theatres did not always feel confident to raise questions or issues over important elements of patient care with surgeons. The GOSH Trust \"had not been delivering a safe service for patients\", the review team added.\n\nThe lawyer representing families of children treated by Mr Jabbar at GOSH, the Portland Hospital and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital welcomed the widening investigation, calling for full transparency. \u201cSadly, at Great Ormond Street, in many of the cases we have seen so far, there has been a lack of documentation available with regards to Mr Jabbar\u2019s decision-making process when treating patients and his consultation with other colleagues and parents, which has raised concerns over the governance and management of the department as a whole,\" Caroline Murgatroyd, of Hudgell Solicitors, said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how Mr Jabbar was managed when working in other hospitals and whether any concerns were raised at any of these locations when he was treating children.\u201d\n\nSt John and St Elizabeth Hospital said there had been three adult inpatient procedures there between October 2020 and January 2023, when Mr Jabbar had had practising privileges there, but no concerns had been raised about his practice. \"Alongside several other providers, we are working closely with Great Ormond Street Hospital to assist them in their review,\" the hospital said.\n\nCromwell Hospital said Mr Jabbar had operated on 12 adults and six children, during the short time he worked there. \"We received no complaints about Mr Jabbar\u2019s treatment,\" it said. \"Since the concerns around Mr Jabbar came to light, we have proactively contacted all patients directly and are continuing to stay in close contact while this investigation proceeds.\" The hospital was committed to the highest standards of care, it added.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?",

The Tesco delivery lorry driver escaped with minor injuries following the crash, according to police. Traffic on the M26 westbound between junction 2A near Wrotham Heath and M25/A21 was also diverted.\n\nA heavy goods vehicle fire on the M25 has led to closures\n\nSix fire crews, South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) and officers from Surrey Police attended the scene. National Highways said a separate incident closing the east tunnel at Dartford meant the M26 diversion route was \"severely congested\". Robert Bell, network operations manager for National Highways in the South East, said: \u201cThe challenging nature and extensive damage these incidents have caused means the closures are going to run into tonight\u2019s commute and my advice is to please plan your journey, allow extra time, and avoid the area if you possibly can.\"\n\nFire crews were at the scene of the lorry fire for 10 hours. Surrey Police said: \"The M25 remains affected in both directions between J5 and J6. \"The anti-clockwise carriageway has reopened, but lane 3 and 4 (of 4) remain closed within J6.\"",

    "British newspaper group the Guardian has announced it will no longer post on X, formerly Twitter, saying it has become a \"a toxic media platform\". In a message to readers, external, it said the US presidential election \"underlined\" its concerns that its owner, Elon Musk, had been able to use X to \"shape political discourse.\" Mr Musk strongly backed Donald Trump and has now been given a role cutting government spending in his incoming administration. The BBC has contacted X for comment. The Guardian said users would still be able to share articles and it was likely continue to embed X posts in its coverage of world events. It also said its reporters would be able to carry on using the site \"for news-gathering purposes.\" But it said the \"benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives.\" \"This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism,\" it added. The decision was also posted on X itself, where some users reacted with vitriol, with those who paid for prominent replies accusing the Guardian of \"woke propaganda\" and \"virtue signalling\".\n\nMr Musk and the Guardian are far from political bed fellows, so in that sense it is not surprising that the newspaper has responded to his and X's increasing alignment with Trump in this way. But it can also be argued the election result is an opportunity for the paper, which describes itself as \"the world's leading liberal voice.\" It is positioning itself as a key part of the \"resistance\" to Donald Trump, using the US election to highlight that is a media organisation without a billionaire proprietor - while also asking its readers for donations. The day after the election, readers pledged more than $1.8m (\u00a31.4m), a record for a single day. Ben Mullin, the New York Times\u2019 media reporter, described the media group\u2019s fundraising as \"a sign that some outlets are tapping a surge of enthusiasm for adversarial journalism post-election\". The Guardian's departure is also likely to intensify questions about whether others will follow. X's rivals already appear to be benefiting.

For many years, the conference has been co-chaired by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, who until recently served as chairman of Saint-Gobain - the parent company of one of the firms heavily criticised in the recent Grenfell inquiry. While the MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney is not resigning as a minister, she said she was relinquishing her building safety brief because \"perception matters\".\n\nThe last meeting of the Colloque was held in January, several months before the general election. Mr De Chalendar reportedly no longer serves as the co-chair of the conference. The former head of Saint-Gobain was in charge of the company at the time of the Grenfell fire, when it was a majority shareholder of Celotex. Celotex was one of the firms to manufacture the combustible insulation inside the cladding on Grenfell Tower. The Grenfell Inquiry's Phase 2 report, external heavily criticised Celotex for launching a \"dishonest scheme to mislead its customers\" over the suitability of its insulation for use on high-rise buildings. According to the register of MPs' interests, Ali was one of half a dozen MPs who attended this year's Colloque in Paris in January. Ali was re-elected to her east London seat in July, where she has been an MP since 2010. In a statement, the Minister for Homelessness and rough sleeping said: \u201cTrusted relationships between ministers and the Grenfell community are essential for this Department. \"Before I became a minister, I called for the French delegation of the Franco-British Colloque to cut ties with Saint Gobain. But I understand that perception matters and I have therefore concluded that the building safety portfolio would be best transferred to another minister. \u201cOur goals of making buildings safe and preventing another tragedy continue to be very important issues for me, and the deputy prime minister and the rest of the ministerial team have my full support in delivering on this work.\u201d",

    "Police are trying to piece together what happened to Ms Brella, who lived in Corby\n\nPeople have spoken of their sadness and confusion after the suspected murder of a woman whose body was found in the boot of a car more than 100 miles from her home. Police believe Pankaj Lamba murdered his wife Harshita Brella in Northamptonshire earlier this month. The 24-year-old's body was discovered in Ilford, east London, and the suspect is believed to have fled the country. \"I don\u2019t understand how people can do [something] like that,\" said Aleksanders Nadejs, who lives in the same road as the couple in Corby.\n\nNeighbour Aleksanders Nadejs said he was \"feeling sad\" at news of Ms Brella's suspected murder\n\nPrashant Odedara, who works at a nearby convenience store, said Ms Brella and Mr Lamba visited the shop \"once or twice a week\" and \"didn't talk much about themselves\". \"Unlike other customers, they were very friendly.

What was happening in their personal private life, we don\u2019t know much about.\"\n\nShopkeeper Prashant Odedara said Ms Brella and her husband were quiet but friendly people\n\nRyan Morgan, 31, who has lived in the road since May, described the last few days as \"crazy\", because of the emergency services and media in the area. \"I've got two young kids, a two-year-old and a four-year-old, so it is a bit worrying knowing that someone has potentially been murdered just next door to us,\" he said. The BBC understands multiple people lived in the property, along with Ms Brella and her husband.\n\nRyan Morgan, who moved into the road in May, said hearing the news was a bit worrying\n\nOfficers said Ms Brella was found in the early hours of Thursday in the vehicle in Brisbane Road, Ilford, more than 100 miles from her home on the Lincoln estate in Corby. They believe Mr Lamba transported her there. Northamptonshire Police had been contacted on the Wednesday regarding concerns for her welfare.\n\nMs Brella's body was found about 100 miles away from her home in Corby\n\nPolice have released a photo of Pankaj Lamba, who they believe has fled the country\n\nThe force said it had made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because there was previous contact with Ms Brella. The Northamptonshire Telegraph, external first reported she was the subject of a domestic violence protection order, saying it was made in early September and lasted 28 days. Police have since confirmed the order had been in place before Ms Brella's death.

The inquest into the death of Ms Brella is due to open on Wednesday.\n\nMs Brella and her husband Pankaj Lamba lived at an address on the Lincoln estate in Corby",
    "Saracens centre Alex Lozowski says he never gave up hope of an England recall after returning to the fold for the first time in six years.\n\nThe 31-year-old last played for England in November 2018, but is part of Steve Borthwick's 36-man squad for the upcoming autumn internationals.\n\nWith Henry Slade touch-and-go after shoulder surgery, Lozowski is in contention to feature against New Zealand on 2 November.\n\n\"I am determined this time around to enjoy it - I really mean it,\" he told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"Back in 2018 I was a younger player, more inexperienced, and I put myself under a lot of pressure potentially, and maybe I found it hard to actually really enjoy being in the England rugby team.\n\n\"You really should be trying to make the most of it if you can. Before I let that not happen, but I am determined this time - however long it is for - to come in with a smile on my face.\"\n\nLozowski won five caps under former head coach Eddie Jones, making his debut in Argentina in 2017, but found himself jettisoned from the set-up following England's erratic first-half performance against Japan in the autumn of 2018.\n\n\"It was probably the one game if I could have another crack at and do it again then I would,\" Lozowski admitted.\n\n\"But a lot of things happened that day and I don't think it was all my fault necessarily. Obviously I paid a heavy price for the way it went in the first half, but that's a long time ago and I'm looking forward now.\n\n\"Initially I was pretty negative about it and carried it around with me, and thought I was not good enough. But since then England have had some excellent players in my position.\n\n\"I was - and am - up against excellent players. Just because you are not playing for England every week doesn't mean you are no good. It's just a high level and very competitive.\"\n\nWith Borthwick replacing Jones at the end of 2022, Lozowski's hopes of forcing himself back into the England reckoning were dashed by a serious knee injury in November 2023, ruling him out for the bulk of last season.\n\nHowever, he returned at the back end of the campaign before starring for Sarries over the first five rounds of the Premiership.\n\n\"I never gave up [on a recall]. I kept doing my best and wanting to play my best to give myself a chance. Funny things happen in sport and in rugby,\" he said.\n\n\"I\u2019m really loving being here.

    "Martin Hibbert was left with a spinal cord injury as a result of the attack in May 2017\n\nTwo survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing have won a High Court harassment case against a former television producer who claimed the attack was staged. Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve sued Richard Hall for harassment and data protection in what was the first such case launched against a conspiracy theorist in the UK. Mr Hibbert was left with a spinal cord injury and Ms Hibbert suffered severe brain damage as a result of the attack at the venue on 22 May 2017. Mr Hall had told the court his actions, which included filming Eve outside her home, were in the public interest as a journalist and claimed \"millions of people\" had \"bought a lie\" about the attack.\n\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade rucksack-bomb in the foyer of the venue as thousands of people left an Ariana Grande concert.\n\u2022 None BBC Sounds: What happens when tragedy makes you a target? The court was told the Hibberts were among those standing nearest to the bomber at the time of the blast. Across several videos and a book, Mr Hall claimed several of those who died were living abroad or were dead before the attack and told the court he believed that no-one was \"genuinely injured\" in the bombing.\n\nTwenty two people died and at least 59 were injured in the attack in 2017\n\nIn a 63-page judgement, Mrs Justice Steyn said the Hibberts had won their harassment claim, but said she would not decide the data protection claim at this stage. The judge said she found Hall to be \"unreflective and insensitive to the level of distress likely to be caused by his persistent attempts to discredit what those who have suffered so tragically in the Attack say about it\". He \"abused media freedom\" to publish false allegations based on the \"flimsiest of analytical techniques, and dismissing the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested\". Mr Hibbert said the ruling was a \"comprehensive victory\" which he hoped would help \"protect others from what we have been put through in the future\". He said he planned to talk to his legal team following the ruling with the aim of \"establishing a new law in Eve's name\". \"I don't want to make much more comment until the final terms of the judgment are agreed in terms of settlements, and hopefully an injunction being imposed.\"\n\nRichard Hall claimed his actions were in the public interest\n\nThe judge said there was \"powerful evidence that Mr Hall's course of conduct caused Mr Hibbert to suffer alarm, distress and anxiety\". Jonathan Price, representing the Hibberts, said the bomb had changed his clients' lives \"in every conceivable way\". \"They have both suffered life-changing injuries from which they will never recover,\" the barrister said. The court heard that Mr Hibbert received 22 wounds from shrapnel, while his daughter suffered a \"catastrophic brain injury\" and was initially presumed dead at the scene after a bolt from the bomb struck her in the head. \"Martin, paralysed, saw Eve lying next to him with a hole in her head and assumed he was watching her die, unable to help,\" he said. \"He saw others lying dead or injured around him.\"\n\nKerry Gillespie, a solicitor for the Hibberts, the case was \"hugely important in the wider context of sending a very clear message to people who think they have the right to publish absurd, harmful, unfounded allegations against others.\" \"This is often happening against people who have already suffered from high-profile tragedies in their lives\", she said \u201cSadly, we live in a world where this repugnant behaviour is becoming all the more common, where people like Mr Hall have access to many media platforms which enable them to publish their abhorrent, unfounded opinions and allegations. \u201cMany feel they can do this unchallenged, hiding behind the facade of challenging the official narrative.\" She said the Judge\u2019s findings set a precedent which would pave the way for more people's behaviour to be challenged and brought to the courts.\n\nIt is the first time such action has been taken - and won - in the UK against a conspiracy theorist. The ruling follows a BBC Panorama and Radio 4 podcast investigation in 2022, which revealed how the Hibberts were among victims targeted by Mr Hall. Hall has described online how he tracked down survivors to their homes and workplaces in what he said was to see if they were lying about their injuries. He admitted to the BBC that he spied on Eve Hibbert from a vehicle parked outside her home. He also described his tactics in a book he sells and promoted theories online that several other UK terror attacks were staged. During the original investigation he insisted the BBC was wrong about how he operates. This civil case sets a huge precedent for terror attack survivors and people more generally targeted by conspiracy theories here in the UK, including accusations they are paid actors or what they lived through was staged. It is a blueprint for holding the people who spread these ideas on social media to account, with those targeted describing how they have often felt there was no way of stopping this happening.",
    "Charli XCX: 'My parents drove me to raves aged 15'\n\nPop star Charli XCX has revealed how her parents drove her to raves where she was performing, at the age of just 15. She added that she managed to persuade them to do that by telling them she had \"swim practice... At 2:00 A.M.\" The singer's album Brat inspired a cultural phenomenon in the summer, with many people adopting the \"brat\" way of life. It has built momentum since its release in June this year, through not only its original tracks, but remixes too.\n\nThe British singer, who is now 32, delivered an opening monologue while hosting Saturday Night Live (SNL) on NBC in the US. In it, Charli, whose real name is Charlotte Aitchison, told viewers how she got to where she is now. \"I actually started performing when I was really young, and I played at my first rave when I was 15 years old,\" she said. \"My parents actually drove me there. And, if you're wondering how did I get my parents to drive me to a rave? Well, I just told them, 'guys, I've got swim practice. At 2:00 A.M.'\"\n\nShe went on to joke that she has come \"a long way\" and now considers herself \"a triple threat, which in England means I sing, I drink, and I smoke\". Charli's sixth studio album inspired millions of posts on social media, plenty of dance moves and even reached the heights of American politics, with US presidential candidate Kamala Harris giving her social media a brat rebrand in an attempt to attract younger voters. During her appearance on SNL, the British pop star defined exactly what brat means to her. \"So many people have asked me, what is brat, and honestly, it's just like an attitude, it's a vibe,\" she said. \"I have to say brat summer has been a crazy experience,\" she added.\n\nA Brat hat that was knitted in support of Kamala Harris\n\nIn attempting to define the word on SNL, she cited an incident where US businesswoman Martha Stewart had mistakenly claimed a journalist who covered her legal proceedings was dead. \"Martha gets mad about an old magazine article and she says that she's glad the journalist who wrote it is dead - that is brat,\" she said. \"And then last Friday, when that exact journalist responded and said, 'Hey, 'I'm alive...' - that is extremely brat.\" Charli, who was also a musical guest on the show, went on to say: \"Honestly though, anyone can be brat.\" \"Keeping it real is very brat, it is all about being vulnerable, so truly, this is a dream come true,\" she said. \"I am so excited to be here, and I'm not used to being out this early on a Saturday night but for you guys, it's worth it.\" Charli has previously defined brat as a girl who \"has a breakdown, but kind of like parties through it\", who is honest, blunt, \"a little bit volatile\". She told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast that someone brat might have \"a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra\". Creating an aesthetic has been something popularised on TikTok, with Charli's brat girl summer seen as a rejection of other trends such as the \"clean girl\" who looks feminine and well kept. Brat was crowned Collins Dictionary word of the year earlier this month, with lexicographers defining it as someone with a \"confident, independent and hedonistic attitude\".",
    "Singer Caity Baser showed her brat credentials while performing in London in August, at Gunnersbury Park\n\nBrat is a word you've probably seen just about everywhere over the last couple of months and now it's officially Collins Dictionary word of the year. Defined as someone with a \"confident, independent and hedonistic attitude\" it has been inspired by Charli XCX. What started as the name of her number one album has arguably grown into a cultural movement for some, with people adopting the brat way of life. Even the team for US presidential candidate Kamala Harris decided to give her social media a brat rebrand, to attract younger voters at the start of her campaign this summer.\n\nCharli XCX has created a brat phenomenon with her aesthetic and way of life\n\nCollins' lexicographers, who put together their dictionaries, look at social media and other sources to determine which words should be added to their annual list of new and notable words. Brat is the name of Charli's sixth studio album, which has built momentum since its release in June this year, through not only its original tracks, but remixes too. The song with most commercial success has been Guess, which went to number one in August after a remix with Billie Eilish was released.\n\nAnnette Corsino, owner of the Knitting Tree LA , works on a hat named Brat in support of Kamala Harris\n\nBrat is, in the words of the singer, a girl who \"has a breakdown, but kind of like parties through it\", who is honest, blunt, \"a little bit volatile\". She told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast that someone brat might have \"a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra\". Creating an aesthetic has been something popularised on TikTok, with Charli's brat girl summer seen as a rejection of other trends such as the \"clean girl\" who looks feminine and well kept. Brat is also about being hedonistic and rebellious, something Charli says was inspired by her early days of performing at illegal raves, which is again in stark contrast to other popular aesthetics that focus on staying at home and living a wholesome life.\n\nAnother word that has made it onto this year's list is era - which is inspired by Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, which visited the UK and Europe this year. The Collins team have defined it as \"a period of one's life or career that is of a distinctive character\". A lot of the words on this year's list have been popularised by Generation Z, those born between 1995 and 2012 and even Generation Alpha - who are only as old as 10 or 11. Once again social media apps like TikTok and Snapchat have a lot to answer for when it comes to the growth of new words and phrases, according to Collins. Yapping, which means talking about length about things that don't really matter that much and delulu, being unrealistic with your expectations, also make it onto this year's list. Despite it being the year of elections globally, only one political term makes it onto this list - supermajority. It is defined as a \"large majority in a legislative assembly that enables a government to pass laws without effective scrutiny\" and became popular around the UK general election in July.",

In 2022, the group set an unofficial record for the world's biggest ever gathering of dogs of any single breed, with 2,238 dogs in attendance.

    "A coroner has delivered her conclusions at the inquest into the death of Brianna Ghey\n\nSchools involved with one of Brianna Ghey's killers could not have foreseen that she and her accomplice would have plotted to murder the teenager, a coroner has ruled. Jacqueline Devonish, senior coroner for Cheshire, found the transfer of Scarlet Jenkinson to Brianna's school had been appropriately managed and had not contributed to the 16-year-old's death. She also said Brianna\u2019s own health had not contributed to her death, except that it had made her vulnerable to manipulation by Jenkinson. Jenkinson, along with Eddie Radcliffe, murdered Brianna at a park in Warrington on 11 February 2023.\n\nAn earlier trial heard how she had lured Brianna to Culcheth Linear Park, where she was waiting with Ratcliffe. The pair, both 15, were convicted of Brianna\u2019s murder and sentenced to life in prison earlier this year. The coroner said there had been no reason for anyone to suspect that the friendship between the two girls had been anything but genuine.\n\nBrianna had been a pupil at Birchwood High School, Warrington, where she was befriended by Jenkinson. Jenkinson had been transferred from Culcheth High School after she \u201cspiked\u201d a younger pupil with cannabis-laced sweets. Following her \"managed transfer\" from Culcheth, where Ratcliffe was also a pupil, Jenkinson became obsessed with Brianna and began plotting her murder with Ratcliffe. From age 14, Jenkinson had watched videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers, her trial heard. But these \"dark fantasies\" were not known to either school or any other adults, the trial heard. The three-day inquest at Warrington Coroner\u2019s Court examined safeguarding for all three teenagers, and how Brianna was brought into contact with Jenkinson. But the hearing was told despite Jenkinson\u2019s misbehaviour in school, no-one could have foreseen she was planning to murder Brianna.\n\nConcluding the inquest, Ms Devonish said: \"There was no reason for anyone to suspect the friendship was anything other than genuine. She said there were no visible signs that Brianna was at risk from Jenkinson. \"She had been planning Brianna\u2019s murder since late 2022. Eddie Ratcliffe was the only person who knew, other than Scarlett Jenkinson,\" Ms Devonish said. \"I found that the schools could not have reasonably foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe would have plotted and murdered Brianna. \"It could not have, on the evidence available at the time, reasonably have been foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson was mentally unstable so that she would kill.\" Both Brianna and Jenkinson had a history of self-harm and personal issues affecting their schooling. Jenkinson had also assaulted another pupil and turned up for class drunk and smelling of cannabis. Brianna, who was transitioning gender, had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Her mother Esther Ghey said Brianna had become \"immersed in darkness\", falling behind in schoolwork and spending a lot of time online, garnering thousands of followers on TikTok and YouTube by posting video content. The coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, but said there was no need for prevention of future deaths reports to be sent to either school.",
    "Shay Kang was found with chest wounds at a house in Rowley Regis on 4 March\n\nA woman who stabbed her daughter 11 times in the chest as she slept has been given an indefinite hospital order. Shay Kang was found at a house in Robin Close in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, on 4 March. Her mother Jaskirat Kaur had paranoid schizophrenia and believed she was being targeted by \"lasers and technology\", Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. The 33-year-old admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility at the same court in August.\n\nJaskirat Kaur stabbed her daughter Shay 11 times in the chest as she slept\n\nShe had denied murdering her daughter and her manslaughter plea was accepted by prosecutors. The court heard she killed her 10-year-old daughter with a Swiss Army knife and then called emergency services hours later to say: \"My kid is dead\". When police arrived at their home after the 999 call, the mother-of-one told them there had been \"projections coming in and out\" of their home, with \"tech and lasers and stuff\". She told them: \"It was me [that killed her], because I didn't want her getting took by it.\" Those in the public gallery sobbed as graphic details of the moment Kaur killed her daughter were read to the court.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, she admitted to detectives that she had wanted to kill her daughter for the past seven months. While she was being interviewed, she told police: \"They can't adopt her, they can't take her. It's not going to make sense, but to me it does.\" She said she was worried about her growing up and that there \"needed to be an end date\". \"I would kill her again. I wanted her to die, I don't regret it,\" she said. The court heard two forensic psychiatrists had determined Kaur had been suffering paranoid schizophrenia at the time. Katherine Goddard KC, mitigating for Kaur, said it was a \"deep-seated and long-term\" condition, with no guarantee of future improvement. \"In short, she will not recover from this condition quickly and there will remain a real risk of relapse,\" she added.\n\nShay's godmother, Kayleigh Coclough, said she was a \"happy and bubbly\" child\n\nJudge Michael Chambers KC accepted a recommendation that Kaur should be given an indefinite hospital order to protect the public from serious harm. \"This is a truly dreadful and tragic loss of life,\" he said. \"Every child looks to his or her mother for love and protection and this was a gross breach of that trust.\" He said Kaur's severe mental illness had caused them to both live socially isolated lives, and it was difficult to comprehend the enormity of what she had done. \"Shay had her whole life before her. She appeared as a happy and contented girl. That was the appearance she gave to the world, but sadly the reality of life at home was very different,\" he added.\n\nShay was a pupil at Brickhouse Primary School and concerns had been raised about her welfare after she failed to attend for nine months between December 2022 and September 2023. Kaur contacted police on 11 January 2023, the same day the school also contacted officers requesting a safe and well check on Shay as she had not attended, the court heard. Police found the curtains drawn and observed that Kaur was suffering from paranoia. During a second visit a few days later she said she was not sending her daughter to school because a \"male was going to take her from there\". Officers advised her to see her GP, but noted Shay seem in good health and not in immediate danger, prosecutor Sally Howes KC told the court. Police shared their body-worn camera footage with the school's pastoral team after a third visit in September to which the team said they were \"shocked\" at Shay's regression since she stopped attending school. Social workers then became involved as police considered her a \"child in need\" and an assessment was carried out on 27 September. They said Shay looked \"relatively healthy but pale\" despite having an \"unsteady gait\" and stilted arm movements, while her mother was said to be anxious and paranoid. But by November, when a child in need plan was put in place, Shay's speech had regressed to babbling and Kaur remained paranoid despite engaging with social services more, the court was told. Upon her return to school in January this year, her speech improved. Shay told teachers she had had no-one to speak to while at home and she and her mother spent their time in separate rooms and \"did nothing and went nowhere\". The youngster told her teachers she would spend her time daydreaming or playing on her Nintendo DS and there was no physical affection between mother and daughter.\n\nBrickhouse Primary School, where Shay was a pupil, described her as a \"bright, happy, fun-loving child who was well liked by all\". Her body was formally released to the school's headteacher and her funeral, which was held in September, was arranged by the school. The school community raised \u00a38,875 for Shay's funeral, with any left over money going towards permanent tributes to her on the school's estate. Carla Newby, the school's pastoral officer, read out a tribute in court on behalf of her and her husband, the school's head teacher Paul Newby, as Kaur listened. She said Shay was a popular pupil whose \"smile could brighten up the dimmest of days\". \"This is the most horrific and devastating situation we have ever had to manage,\" she said. She added: \"It was an honour for us both to have been chosen to arrange her funeral and give her a send-off she deserved.

The Financial Times says Sir Keir Starmer has \u201copened the door\u201d to a multi-billion pound rise, external, which could involve levying national insurance on employer pension contributions.\n\nThe Guardian reports that Treasury officials are examining the move, external, which could raise up to \u00a317bn annually, while a pensions specialist at the consultants PWC tells the FT there could be implications for employee salary sacrifice schemes.\n\nThe Daily Mail says there's fury among business leaders about \u201cLabour's revolution for workers\u201d, external - also known as the Employment Rights Bill - which will be introduced to the Commons on Thursday.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses is quoted warning that new protections from unfair dismissal will deter bosses from taking on new recruits, in case they end up facing a tribunal when someone simply isn't suited to the role. Writing in the Daily Mirror, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner says the reforms are \u201cpersonal\u201d for her, external - and show the government is delivering for working people.\n\nThe lead story for the Daily Express is that some pensioners - who are losing their winter fuel payment - are among more than 100,000 people who have been dragged into paying income tax, external because of frozen thresholds. The former Lib Dem pensions minister Sir Steve Webb, who obtained the data from HMRC, tells the Express it's time personal allowances were raised. The campaign group Silver Voices urges Labour to borrow a Conservative proposal, for an age-related tax allowance.\n\nIn other news, the Daily Telegraph proposes five possible explanations for the shock elimination of James Cleverly from the Conservative leadership contest, external. By far the most complex of these involves supporters of Robert Jenrick backing Cleverly in previous rounds, lulling his team into a false sense of security, the paper explains. The Telegraph's leader column says the Conservatives \u201cnever cease to surprise\u201d when it comes to selecting a leader.

    "The Palestinian patients gathered at the European Gaza hospital near Khan Younis before the evacuation\n\nMore than 200 seriously injured and ill Palestinians and their carers have been evacuated from Gaza, in one of the biggest operations of its kind in months, Israel says. The operation - overseen by Cogat, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, and the World Health Organization - saw 231 Gazans allowed through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing. They include people with autoimmune diseases, blood diseases, cancer, kidney conditions and trauma injuries. The WHO said there were still up to 14,000 people waiting for evacuation for medical reasons.\n\nIsrael and Egypt closed their crossings with Gaza following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on 7 October last year. Almost 4,900 Palestinian patients needing treatment abroad were allowed to leave between November, when Egypt reopened the Rafah crossing for medical evacuations, and May, when Egypt closed the crossing after Israeli forces seized control of the Gaza side. Before Wednesday\u2019s evacuation, only 229 patients had left since May, according to the UN.\n\nThe patients will be taken to Romania or the UAE for treatment\n\nWednesday also saw the WHO and Cogat announce the conclusion of the polio vaccination campaign across Gaza. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said 556,770 children under the age of 10 - or 94% - had received two doses of the vaccine since September. The programme came about in reaction to the discovery of a case of polio in August, the first recorded in Gaza for 25 years. The virus can paralyse children or even kill them. It has been the subject of a global vaccination campaign for decades and has been mostly eradicated. On Saturday, the WHO and other UN agencies set out to administer vaccines in Gaza City, after being forced to postpone the rollout in the north of the territory last month because of Israeli bombardment, mass displacement and lack of access. The three-day operation was briefly interrupted by an attack on a hospital. The WHO did not say who was behind the strike, but local medical staff blamed an Israeli quadcopter. The Israeli military said it was investigating but did not believe it was responsible. Dr Tedros said 105,500 children in the north of Gaza received a second dose, which amounted to around 88% coverage. For herd immunity to work, at least 90% of all children in every community and neighbourhood need to be given a minimum of two doses. He warned that \u201c7,000-10,000 children couldn't be reached for their second doses and are thus vulnerable to polio\u201d. Parts of northern Gaza were not included in the vaccinations due to the continuation of intense Israeli military operations in towns like Jabalia and Beit Lahia. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) on Wednesday morning announced that troops had started to operate in Beit Lahia following what it said was intelligence \u201cindicating the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure\u201d. The IDF called on all remaining civilians to leave the area through what it called \u201corganised routes for their safety\u201d. Beit Lahia has come under heavy bombardment since the IDF launched a ground offensive in neighbouring Jabalia a month ago, saying it was acting against regrouping Hamas fighters. The IDF said its troops had killed 50 \u201cterrorists\u201d in Jabalia over the past day. The BBC and other international media are not able to get access to the Gaza Strip and so cannot independently verify these claims.\n\nBeit Lahia has once again come under intense bombardment this past month\n\nThe people transported out of Gaza in the medical evacuation operation will be taken to the United Arab Emirates or Romania for treatment. One of those being moved was Khuloud Tabasi's son Mohammed. Hugging her husband as she entered the ambulance in the southern city of Khan Younis, Khuloud said after four operations her son\u2019s \u201csituation went from bad to worse... Thank God [the WHO] organised the evacuation of my son.\" Israel has been under growing international pressure to do something to improve the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. Last weekend, 15 senior UN figures said conditions in the north were \u201capocalyptic\u201d, with the entire population \u201cat risk of death from starvation, disease and violence\u201d. Israel has also faced calls from its ally, the US, to take action. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the Israeli government on 13 October that it had 30 days to \u201csurge\u201d humanitarian aid to Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off. The numbers still in need of medical support are huge, with 19 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals out of service and the other 17 only partially functional. Dr Marwan Abu Saada is general manager of the al-Shifa medical complex in Gaza City, which was left in ruins after being raided by Israeli forces for a second time in March. The IDF said it had been used by Hamas for military purposes, something the group has always denied. Parts of al-Shifa have now been rebuilt and reopened, including the emergency department, and the hospital recently received patients evacuated from hospitals in Beit Lahia. Dr Abu Saada said there were children with leukaemia, people with breast and other cancers, as well as those disabled by the fighting. \u201cThey desperately need to travel abroad as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \"Since none of the treatment facilities are available in Gaza.\u201d While Wednesday\u2019s evacuation has been widely welcomed, the numbers taken to the UAE and Romania are a small fraction of the total who need medical aid. More than that, as long as the fighting continues, the numbers in need of help will continue to grow.",
    "The Kremlin says the summit is one of the \"largest-scale foreign policy events ever\" in Russia\n\nThe West has dubbed you a pariah for invading Ukraine. Sanctions are aiming to cut off your country's economy from global markets. And there's an arrest warrant out for you from the International Criminal Court. How can you show the pressure is not working? Try hosting a summit. This week in the city of Kazan President Putin will greet more than 20 heads of state at the Brics summit of emerging economies. Among the leaders invited are China\u2019s Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Kremlin has called it one of the \"largest-scale foreign policy events ever\" in Russia. \"The clear message is that attempts to isolate Russia have failed,\" thinks Chris Weafer, founding partner of consultancy firm Macro-Advisory. \"It's a big part of the messaging from the Kremlin that Russia is withstanding sanctions. We know there are severe cracks beneath the surface. But at a geopolitical level Russia has all these friends and they\u2019re all going to be Russia's partners.\" So, who are Russia's friends? Brics stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The grouping, often referred to as a counterweight to the Western-led world, has expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, too, has been invited to join.\n\u2022 None What Moscow really wants from US election The Brics nations account for 45% of the global population. Added together, members' economies are worth more than $28.5tn (\u00a322tn). That's around 28% of the global economy.\n\nThis year's Brics summit is taking place in Kazan, Russia\n\nRussian officials have indicated that another 30 countries want to join Brics or seek closer ties with the club. Some of these nations will take part in the summit. In Kazan this week expect a lot of talk about Brics representing the \"global majority\". But apart from providing Vladimir Putin his moment on the geopolitical stage, what is the event likely to achieve? Keen to ease the pressure from Western sanctions, the Kremlin leader will hope to convince Brics members to adopt an alternative to the dollar for global payments. \"A lot of the problems Russia's economy is facing are linked to cross-border trade and payments. And a lot of that is linked to the US dollar,\" says Mr Weafer. \"The US Treasury has enormous power and influence over global trade simply because the US dollar is the main currency for settling that. Russia's main interest is in breaking the dominance of the US dollar. It wants Brics countries to create an alternative trade mechanism and cross-border settlement system that does not involve the dollar, the euro or any of the G7 currencies, so that sanctions won't matter so much.\" But critics point to differences within Brics. \"Likeminded\" is not a word you would use to describe the current membership. \"In some ways it\u2019s a good job for the West that China and India can never agree about anything. Because if those two were really serious, Brics would have enormous influence,\" notes Jim O'Neill, former Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs. \"China and India are doing their best to avoid wanting to attack each other a lot of the time. Trying to get them to really co-operate on economic things is a never-ending challenge.\" It was Mr O\u2019Neill who, at the turn of the century, dreamt up the acronym \"Bric\" for four emerging economies he believed should be \"brought into the centre of global policy making\". But the four letters would take on a life of their own, after the corresponding nations formed their own Bric group - later Brics, when South Africa joined. They would attempt to challenge the dominance of the G7: the world's seven largest \"advanced\" economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US). It's not just India and China who have their differences. There is tension between two of the newest Brics members, Egypt and Ethiopia. And, despite talk of detente, Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals. \"The idea that they\u2019re all going to fundamentally agree on something of great substance is bonkers really,\" believes Mr O\u2019Neill. And while Russia, fuelled by anti-Western sentiment, talks about creating a \"new world order\", other Brics members, like India, are keen to retain good political and economic relations with the West. In Kazan, Vladimir Putin's task will be to skim over the differences and paint a picture of unity, while showing the Russian public \u2013 and the international community \u2013 that his country is far from isolated.",

    "'Laura had cancer but was misdiagnosed on the phone'\n\nMike Barlow with his late wife Laura. He wants GPs to offer face-to-face appointments to all patients\n\nA woman who died of cancer could have lived longer had she been given a face-to-face appointment with her GP, rather than being misdiagnosed over the phone, her husband has said. Laura Barlow, 33, was told she had endometriosis during a telephone call with a GP at Stickney Surgery, Lincolnshire, in October 2023. In February this year, the mother-of-three, from Sibsey, near Boston, was told she was so ill she should go home from hospital to spend time with her family. She died three days later. In a joint statement, the surgery and United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust said they could not comment on individual cases but would continue to speak to the family about their concerns.\n\nMrs Barlow's husband, Mike, is now calling for mandatory face-to-face appointments with GPs. He believes opportunities were missed for his wife to start treatment for the cancer in November last year. \u201cI think if they'd seen Laura face-to-face they'd have seen how much pain she was in,\" he said. \"Laura died because she was misdiagnosed over the phone. If blood tests had been done we'd have known what was happening. \"Could we have had more time? Could the kids have had more time with their mum?\u201c Mike has also told the BBC that the lack of an inquest means the family is still uncertain about exactly what form of cancer Laura had.\n\nMrs Barlow had three daughters, two with her husband. He says the girls tell their mother they love her every night\n\nThe couple met in 2020 when they were working together at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston. They moved in together with Mrs Barlow's daughter, now 10, and had two more girls, who are three and two. Mrs Barlow initially phoned her GP surgery after finding blood in her stool. She was diagnosed with endometriosis over the phone and given medication, Mr Barlow said. An appointment was booked for her to visit the gynaecology department at Pilgrim Hospital in January, but in mid-December, she became ill at work. Mr Barlow said he had tried to take her to the GP, but was advised to go to the urgent treatment centre at Pilgrim Hospital. However, according to Mr Barlow, the hospital said because she was already under treatment for endometriosis, there was little they could do. Mr Barlow believes that had a blood test been taken at either the GP surgery or the hospital, the cancer could have been discovered.\n\nMrs Barlow, right, with her sister Lisa and brother Wills\n\nAt the end of December, Mrs Barlow went back to A&E. On 2 January, she underwent an ultrasound, when lesions were found. She was admitted to Pilgrim Hospital in mid-January and received a cancer diagnosis. On 2 February, the couple were told her condition was untreatable. \u201cThey said: 'There's nothing we can do. Go home and spend time with your kids,\" Mr Barlow recalled. \"All the family came and we had to get the Macmillan nurses to come out. We got a bed made downstairs and had her in there. \"She was lying down and I slept with her. They woke me up and told me she'd passed away. And that was it.\"\n\nMr Barlow wants GP surgeries to see all patients face-to-face and hopes a petition, started by a friend, external, will gather enough signatures to be discussed in Parliament. Ultimately, he hopes the government will support his proposal. \"I want that to be what happens in Laura's name,\" he said. \u201cWe believe in doctors and what they say. They're the experts. \u201cThey need to see patients face to face. It will save lives. People are dying because they're not being seen.\u201d\n\nMr Barlow had been married to his wife for less than a year when she died\n\nMr Barlow said his wife always put her daughters first. \u201cWe have pictures of Laura and the kids everywhere,\" he said. \u201cEvery night when the kids go to bed they stop on the stairs and look at her photo and tell mummy they love her. \u201cThe girls will ask me, 'what happened to mum, how did she die?' \"I can't give them an answer. I've got to tell them the truth. People failed her'.\" In their joint statement, ULHT, which runs Pilgrim Hospital, and Stickney Surgery said: \u201cWe would again like to offer our deepest condolences to Laura\u2019s family. \u201cWe are unable to comment on individual cases but will continue to speak to the family about their concerns as appropriate.\u201d If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, support is available via the BBC Action Line.

    "Ukraine's human rights ombudsman has denounced the alleged execution of nine captured Ukrainian troops by Russian forces in the Kursk border region. Dmytro Lubinets said he had written to the United Nations and the Red Cross about the allegations, accusing Moscow of breaching \"all the rules and customs of war\". The intervention follows reporting by Ukrainian battlefield analysis site DeepState, which published drone footage purporting to show the dead troops who it said were drone operators. Officials in Russia have yet to comment on the allegations. Kyiv is believed to have deployed thousands of troops into the Russian border region since it launched its shock incursion earlier this summer.\n\nThe images published by DeepState showed the dead Ukrainian troops stripped to their underwear and lying face down in what appeared to be farmland in Kursk. The BBC cannot independently verify the images. The outlet said the drone operators had been overrun by a rapid Russian advance. \"These actions must not go unpunished, and the enemy must bear full responsibility,\" Mr Lubinets wrote in a message to Telegram. \"The international community should not turn a blind eye to such crimes!\" Kyiv has frequently accused Russian of executing captured Ukrainian troops - a war crime under the Geneva Convention. Earlier this month the prosecutor general's office alleged that Russian forces had executed 93 Ukrainian soldiers since the beginning of the conflict. It added that an official investigation had been opened into reports that 16 Ukrainian soldiers were executed in the eastern Donetsk region near the city of Pokrovsk - where fighting has raged for months. Officials said the reports would mark the \"largest mass execution\" of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian troops since Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin denies that its soldiers have been committing war crimes in Ukraine.\n\u2022 None 'Russians invaded my house and held a soldier captive there'\n\u2022 None Russian strike kills eight in fresh attack on Ukrainian port The reports come as Russian forces continue to attack Ukrainian positions in Kursk. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address from Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had fought off a renewed Russian advance in the region. Analysts say that Kyiv launched the offensive to try and force Russia to redirect some of its troops from its offensive in eastern Ukraine. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has estimated that around 40,000 Russian forces are now active in Kursk - up from 11,000 when Ukrainian troops first crossed the border. But the offensive has failed to slow Russian momentum in the eastern Donbas region, where relentless attacks has slowly pushed Ukrainian forces backwards. The Ukrainian leader acknowledged that \"there are very difficult conditions, with harsh enemy actions\" in both Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia in his address on Saturday. On Sunday morning, the Russian defence ministry said its forces had seized the village of Mykhailivka, which sits along a highway near the key city of Pokrovsk. Russian forces have been advancing towards Pokrovsk - which is a key logistics hub - for months. Experts say if Russia can seize the city Ukraine's ability to resupply units in other crucial towns would become far more difficult. Meanwhile, Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine continued overnight. Air force officials in Kyiv said Moscow launched 68 drones and four missiles towards Ukrainian territory.",
    "Assisted dying campaigners, including Dame Esther Rantzen, have welcomed plans for the first Parliamentary vote on the issue in nine years. The presenter, who is terminally ill with lung cancer, said she was surprised she may live to see the Commons debate on the issue likely to take place later this year. But activists on the other side of the argument, including those who campaign for disability rights, have expressed serious concerns about the impact on vulnerable people and any possible future expansions of a would-be law. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is putting the bill forward later this month and said \"now is the time\" to hold a fresh debate, after MPs rejected a similar move in 2015.\n\nThe bill would cover England and Wales, where - like Northern Ireland - assisting someone with ending their life is against the law. In Scotland - where it is not a specific criminal offence but can leave a person open to a murder charge - a bill is currently being considered that, if passed, would give terminally ill adults the right to request help to end their life. Dame Esther, who has been a vocal advocate for legalising assisted dying, said the law as it stands puts her family \"at risk of being accused of killing me\" if they helped her end her life in Switzerland, where she has joined the assisted dying clinic Dignitas.\n\nDame Esther Rantzen wants a change in the law\n\n\"All I\u2019m asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice,\" the Childline founder told Radio 4's Today programme on Friday morning. \"If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die\", Dame Esther continued. Her daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, told BBC Breakfast the issue was \"hugely personal\" and the news of an upcoming vote filled her \u201cwith an enormous sense of relief\u201d. But she added that \u201chowever fast these things go I'm not sure it will help us as a family\". Describing current rules as a \u201cmessy cruel law\u201d, Ms Wilcox said she had been traumatised by her father\u2019s death and her mother did not want them to go through that again. \"It's about those last few days, giving somebody dignity, giving somebody the choice,\u201d she said. But Dr Lucy Thomas, a palliative care and public health doctor, said assisted dying was a last resort which courts - rather than doctors - were better placed to judge. She added that choosing to end your life was not a \"straightforward consumer decision\".\n\nBaroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the former Paralympian and a disability campaigner, told BBC Breakfast that \"there's a lot of worry out there about how this law can expand if it comes in\". The House of Lords crossbencher conceded that the debate cannot be \"shut down\" - but expressed concern around how decisions to end lives will be made, particularly on vulnerable people and victims of coercive control. \"Will there be time given and money spent on actually understanding whether it is someone's free and settled wish?\" Baroness Grey-Thompson asked. Liz Carr, an actor and disability rights activist who made the BBC documentary Better Off Dead, also opposes legalising assisted dying. \u201cSome of us have very real fears based on our lived experience and based on what has happened in other countries where it's legal,\" she posted on X late on Thursday night. Dr Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of campaign group Care Not Killing, argued that the bill's introduction was \"clearly disappointing news\". He said: \"I would strongly urge the government to focus on fixing our broken palliative care system that sees up to one in four Brits who would benefit from this type of care being unable to access it, rather than discussing again this dangerous and ideological policy.\" But Leadbeater insists her bill \"will not undermine calls for improvements to palliative care\".\n\nThe Spen Valley MP said she hoped for \"honest, compassionate and respectful debate\" on her proposal, which would establish the right for terminally-ill eligible adults to have the choice at the end of life to shorten the time before their deaths. She said it would also ensure stronger protections for patients and their loved ones in the aftermath. Leadbeater insists the plan will not conflict with the rights of people with disabilities to be treated equally and \"have the respect and support they are absolutely right to campaign for in order to live fulfilling lives\". \"I support these causes just as passionately\", she said. MPs and peers would have to approve the proposal for it to become law. Details of the bill have not been finalised, but it is likely to be similar to a proposal tabled in the House of Lords, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live to receive medical help to end their own lives. The government will remain neutral on Leadbeater's bill, with MPs expected to have a free vote - meaning they can decide according to their conscience, without party pressure. Cabinet's collective responsibility is also expected to be waived. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously promised to give Labour MPs a chance to vote with their conscience - and has supported a change in the law himself. Asked about the issue during a press conference on Friday morning, he said: \u201cI made a promise to Esther Rantzen before the election that we would provide time for a debate and vote, but that it will be a free vote, and obviously that opportunity has now arisen.\u201d The PM did not indicate how he would vote. The health secretary is understood to be \"conflicted\" over the debate. Wes Streeting backed assisted dying the last time there was a vote and thinks it is right to have a debate now, but is said to have concerns.

    "Warren Gatland won three Grand Slams and reached two World Cup semi-finals in his first stint in charge of Wales\n\nCoverage: Live on S4C, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, live text and commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\n\nWarren Gatland says he wants to continue as Wales head coach as he prepares to face world champions South Africa in Cardiff on Saturday. Gatland has overseen a record 11 successive Test match defeats, and another loss this weekend would see Wales go a calendar year without winning a Test for the first time since 1937. When directly asked whether he had a strong desire to carry on in the job, he replied: \"Absolutely. I think we've been clear in terms of the plan we've had. We've got a group of young players that need a bit of time.\" Gatland added that he understands \"the pressures of international rugby with performances and results\". \"We can only work as hard as we have done. I'm aware of the pressure and that decisions could be made outside of my control,\" said Gatland. \"We've just asked for a little bit of time. Whether we get that time, we'll have to wait and see.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Warren Gatland: Head coach hopes for time to turn Wales' fortunes around\n\nFollowing the record 52-20 defeat against Australia last Sunday, Gatland said he had a conversation with Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) chair Richard Collier-Keywood and executive director of rugby Nigel Walker in the Principality Stadium changing rooms. He has also spoken to his family when considering his future. But three days on from the Australia mauling, Gatland said he has had no indication from anybody that he would not be in charge beyond the upcoming game against the Springboks. The New Zealander, who has rejected speculation that there is a break clause after next year's Six Nations in his contract, said he would resign if it was in the interests of Welsh rugby. \"I do care passionately about Welsh rugby, and that's why I've said that if people feel that the best decision is for me to go, then that's okay, I'll move on and look for something else,\" said Gatland. \"I honestly believe by making that decision now, what are you going to achieve, and is someone else going to come in there, start again and how long is that process going to take?\"\n\nGatland says he has received support over the last few days. \"The amount of people who have contacted me in the last week or and the messages I've had, whether that's by phone or email or messages through my family, has been incredible,\" said Gatland. \"There obviously seems to be a bit of a divide, doesn't there? You know, 'to go or stay'. \"I appreciate people that have reached out and support they've given me but you understand that there's another side of opinion as well.\" Welsh rugby is still waiting for a strategic plan and is struggling on and off the field, compared to Gatland's first 12-year stint in charge of Wales. \"I mentioned in the past that when the dam burst, it was going to take a while to plug it up again, that's probably where we are at the moment,\" said Gatland. \"For a number of years we felt like the success we had with the national team was papering over the cracks underneath. \"We need to look at the future and the pathway and some of the structures to make some changes. \"I've encouraged the union on a number of occasions to be bold about some of the changes that we make in the best interests of Welsh rugby.\"",

    "Yulia and Sergei Skripal survived being poisoned by Novichok in Salisbury\n\nPolice investigating the nerve agent poisoning of an ex-Russian spy were told he was not living in the area and they were \"overreacting\". Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury city centre after being exposed to Novichok in 2018. Officers found out who they were by using Google to search Mr Skripal's name, the inquiry into the death of Dawn Sturgess was told. An email from April 2021 from Wiltshire Police Inspector Gill Hughes said national security unit Special Branch had been \u201cvery dismissive\u201d of the information provided about Mr Skripal\u2019s poisoning by the force\u2019s control room, the inquiry was told.\n\nNick Bailey was poisoned by Novichok which he said left him \"freaking out\"\n\nWiltshire Police was also told by counter-terrorism police that they were \u201cnot aware\u201d that Mr Skripal was housed in Salisbury and \u201cwere not taking any further action\u201d. The inquiry, being held in London, has been called to examine the death of Ms Sturgess who was poisoned with the nerve agent which was unwittingly given to her by her boyfriend Charlie Rowley. Earlier, another officer, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was poisoned by the nerve agent, told the inquiry that Novichok left him \"hot\" and \"freaking out\". He was contaminated after the nerve agent was smeared on former Russian spy Mr Skripal\u2019s door handle in Salisbury in March 2018. Questioning Mr Bailey on his recollection of events, counsel to the inquiry Francesca Whitelaw said: \u201cIt is fair to say the poisoning had a very significant mental and physical impact on you?\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his evidence, Mr Bailey said: \u201cMy recollection of the events of March 2018 is hazy at best. \u201cI spent a lot of time dealing with it when it happened and dealing with the aftermath of it, processing it, and I got to a point where the only way for me to kind of move on from it was to stop thinking about it and to close it off. \u201cSo it\u2019s been some time since I have actually had to then go back to those events \u2013 so yes, my memory of the incident isn\u2019t the best.\u201d Mr Bailey recalled a colleague calling the control room to say \u201ca Russian spy has been poisoned\u201d. \u201cIt is not something that I had heard before and it\u2019s not something I had thought I would ever hear again,\" he said. \u201cI remember thinking \u2018I will never hear that phrase on a Wiltshire Police radio again\u2019.\u201d\n\nMr Bailey was then asked to recall entering Mr Skripal\u2019s address, detailing everything he touched in the house. He also spoke of how his symptoms worsened overnight after being poisoned. He said: \u201cOvernight, I would describe it as getting a lot worse. \u201cI went down at around five in the morning because I was freaking out a little and my vision was impaired. \u201cOnce I turned the lights on, everything was crystal clear and it was juddered as opposed to being a smooth motion of looking around. \u201cIt was almost in frames \u2013 it was quite scary.\u201d The inquiry chairman Lord Hughes concluded Mr Bailey\u2019s evidence by saying: \u201cI am very conscious you have had to relive a very nasty experience but it was necessary and thank you for doing it.\u201d\n\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.

    "Friends and wholesome vibes: Why we're running more\n\nDo you feel like you've been seeing more and more people braving the wet weather to get a run in recently? Maybe #RunTok has crept into your algorithm, or you've got that one friend who keeps posting their latest stats to Insta Stories? You might be on to something. Parkrun, which recently celebrated its 20th birthday, says its biggest recent growth has come from people aged 20 to 29. And the organisers of the Great North Run, the largest half marathon in the UK, say 13.3% of runners this year were under 25, up from 10.9% the year before. So why are more people taking part in running and run clubs?\n\n\"It\u2019s really difficult making friends in your twenties,\" says Megan Titterington, who runs an all-female running group in Oxfordshire. \"I feel like going to a run club kills two birds with one stone,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat. \"It's a social outlet and you get to meet new people, but also you're able to just fit in and work out, which is so important.\" Megan, 24, set up the club after a chat with her co-founder over TikTok. \"In February and we had maybe like 20-30 sign-ups for a first run, and now it\u2019s 75,\" she says. \"I think it's just the fact that so many people really want to [socialise],\"\n\nMegan thinks social run clubs like hers help people to feel safer. According to run-tracking app Strava, those aged 18-29 are the most likely to be running, and in 2023 women were more likely to upload runs than men. As winter approaches, concerns around running alone in the dark resurface, especially among women. \"I'd rather not run for three months, than attempt to run in the dark,\" Megan says. \"Even when going on a run as a female during the day, things can still happen as they can happen to anyone. \"But being part of a running group, knowing that you're all going to stick together and you won't be left alone at any point on that run is really nice,\" she says.\n\nJade has been influenced by social media to take up running\n\nJade, from south Wales, started running in April and tells Newsbeat it can get \"a bit lonely when you\u2019re out there on your own\". She\u2019s also set up her own run club. \"It does build up community where you feel safe,\" she says. \"Especially coming into the winter months. \"We are going to need it because we're not going to be going out in the dark by ourselves, because we know as women [how] bad it is.\"\n\nThe opportunity to feel like you're improving your lifestyle also appeals to Jade. \"I want to be that girl who is going for a run and then getting her morning matcha,\" she says. She says social media influencers have provided an aspirational image. \"I saw a lot of girls going out then they have coffee dates after it. And I was like: 'that sounds great'. \"Especially once you leave uni and are in your mid- to late twenties, you do think you\u2019re [over] that drinking culture,\" she says. \"People are leaning more towards going out running, going for a swim or walks.\" She adds those are cheaper options in the long run, compared to nights out and gym memberships, after the initial cost of trainers and kit.\n\nAbbey and Laura (right) feel running has made a positive impact on their lives\n\nRunning does come with risks - the NHS warns, external that injuries to the knees, shins and muscles can affect people of all experience levels. It recommends warming up before starting, not pushing yourself too hard at first, and ensuring you've got suitable footwear. But many, like Laura Woodiwiss, say running has had a positive impact on their lives. Laura, 26, says bonding with her mates usually meant \"bottomless brunches and drink\". \"And it was getting earlier and earlier every time we met up,\" she says. \"But now it's like we're factoring in a parkrun in the morning. \"We're not actually drinking that much and I do think the lifestyle change... makes me feel I have achieved more.\" And there is nothing quite like the post-run feeling of the \"runner's high\", she says. \"You're doing something more enjoyable and then coming out of it feeling really good.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "How hurricane conspiracy theories took over social media\n\nFalse information spread on social media claimed the US government was \"geo-engineering\" the weather\n\nA deluge of misinformation online about back-to-back hurricanes in the US has been fuelled by a social media universe that rewards engagement over truth. The scale and speed of false rumours about Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton has been unlike many of the frenzies I\u2019ve investigated online before. Viral posts have ranged from seemingly innocuous questions about the legitimacy of forecasts and rescue efforts, to false claims - repeated by Donald Trump - that hurricane relief funds are being spent on migrants who entered the US illegally. Others spread false images of the wreckage - faked pictures of children fleeing devastation that were generated by artificial intelligence (AI), old clips showing different storms or computer-generated (CGI) videos. And then there were those who shared false and evidence-free conspiracy theories about the government manipulating - or \u201cgeo-engineering\u201d- the weather. \u201cYes they can control the weather,\u201d wrote Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene last week on X.\n\u2022 None No, Hurricane Milton was not 'engineered' Most of the viral misinformation has come from social media profiles which have blue ticks and a track-record for sharing conspiracy theories. Several accounts which spread Hurricane Milton misinformation this week had previously shared posts suggesting real-life events were staged or rigged, from elections to political violence, the pandemic and wars. I messaged dozens of accounts which shared false and misleading posts on X related to both hurricanes. Their accounts seemed to be able to go viral precisely because of changes made at X since Elon Musk became owner. While the blue-check used to be given out only to people who had been verified and vetted, users are now allowed to purchase these ticks. The algorithm, in turn, gives their posts greater prominence. They can also then profit from sharing posts, regardless of whether they are true or not. X\u2019s revenue sharing policy means that blue-tick users can earn a share of revenue from the ads in their replies. On 9 October, the site announced that \u201cpayouts are increasing\u201d, and accounts would now be paid based on engagement from other users who pay to get Premium membership, not the adverts in their responses. This has incentivised some users to share whatever it is that will go viral \u2013 however untrue. Several of those I messaged acknowledged to me that they benefitted from getting engagement from their posts and sharing content they know will get attention. It\u2019s true, most social media companies allow users to make money from views. But YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook have guidelines which allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post content that spreads misinformation, and say they label posts when they are misleading. X does not have guidelines on misinformation in the same way. While it has rules against faked AI content and \"Community Notes\" to add context to posts, it removed a previous feature which allowed users to report misleading information. X did not respond to the BBC\u2019s request for comment. Misleading posts which go viral on X can also travel over to the comment section of videos on other sites, too, showing how an idea shared on one site can spread through the social-media ecosystem. \"Wild Mother\", a social media influencer who regularly shares unproven theories across different sites, said that four years ago, her comments were filled with \u201cpeople calling me names, denying it\u201d. \u201cAnd now, I was surprised to see that nearly every comment is in agreement,\u201d she said, referring to a recent post discussing conspiracy theories about geo-engineering and the recent hurricanes. There is a real-world impact to this kind of disinformation, which can undermine trust in authorities - in this case - during a complex rescue and recovery operation following Hurricane Milton. Although misinformation has always spread during natural disasters, there\u2019s a crucial difference between now and previous storms. For one, the falsehoods being shared are spreading to more people \u2013 fewer than three dozen false or abusive posts were viewed 160 million times on X, according to the Institute of Strategic Dialogue think tank. They have also taken on a sharper political edge because of the impending US presidential election.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, and other politicians, have helped spread misinformation on X\n\nMany of the most viral posts come from accounts which support Donald Trump, ISD found. And they are taking aim at foreign aid and migrants. Several posts and videos have even targeted relief workers, who are accused of \u201ctreason\u201d for taking part in untrue, outlandish plots. The anger and distrust this can foster risks inhibiting efforts on the ground. Ahead of an election, it also risks undermining wider faith in how systems and government work, and of overshadowing any legitimate criticism of governments\u2019 efforts. While Wild Mother, and people like her, choose to view this as a sign that \u201cmore and more people are waking up to reality\", I see it as a sign that these conspiracy theories are gaining a wider audience. She tells me how \u201ca well informed collective is much harder to control\u201d. In other words, the more people who believe these kinds of evidence-free conspiracy theories, the harder it is to combat them. This ultimately comes down to the way the algorithms across social media sites favour engagement above all else. These conspiracy theories, false claims and hate can reach hundreds of thousands of people before anyone realises they\u2019re are untrue - and those sharing them can be rewarded with views, likes, followers or money in return.

    "The murder of a two-year-old was \"gross, cruel, brutal, catastrophic and totally devoid of humanity\u201d, a judge at Belfast Crown Court was told as he considered how long her killer and her mother must spend in jail. Ali Jayden Doyle died from head injuries she suffered at a house in Park Avenue in Dungannon in August 2021. Ali Jayden's mother Jade Dempsey admitted child cruelty and is yet to be sentenced. Dempsey's on-off boyfriend at the time, 35-year-old Darryn John Armstrong, admitted the toddler's murder and was handed an automatic life sentence, but the minimum number of years he must serve before applying for parole has not yet been set.\n\nA tariff hearing was held at Belfast Crown Court on Thursday where both prosecution and defence barristers read final submissions. Armstrong, whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry, initially blamed Ali Jayden\u2019s one-year-old brother for causing the fatal wound by throwing a toy at her, causing her to fall back and hit her head on a fireplace.\n\nA prosecution barrister said Armstrong later changed his story during separate police interviews and said he threw the child and she hit her head on the fireplace. He said he had been under the influence of drugs and his dogs had run into the house and startled the children. The barrister said the killer changed his story again and said he had no recollection of what happened, but admitted responsibility. The court heard that according to a report from a pathologist, the severe injuries sustained were the result of blunt force. A report from a doctor in neurosurgery said they \u201ccould envision a scenario where the child was grabbed by its torso and slammed down\u2026with a serious degree of force\u201d. The barrister said due to the severity of the injuries sustained: \"There couldn\u2019t have been any other intention but to kill in this case\u201d.\n\nDarryn John Armstrong was handed a life sentence in May 2024 after pleading guilty to Ali Jayden's murder\n\nThe court heard that on the day of the murder, Dempsey left her children in Armstrong\u2019s care while she left to go to Belfast to buy a pram. Shortly afterwards she received a WhatsApp video from Armstrong, showing Ali Jayden sitting watching TV. But about 15 minutes later while waiting at the bus station, Dempsey was called to return home. The prosecution barrister outlined how the ambulance service arrived to Ali Jayden unconscious, laying on the bedroom floor. Her hair was wet and a towel was wrapped around her. The prosecution barrister told the court that Armstrong had said the child was burning up and he was trying to revive her by putting water on her. They also outlined how a neighbour described hearing \u201cthree screeches\u201d coming from Armstrong\u2019s home at about the time of the murder but that the noise then stopped.\n\nThe court heard that Dempsey\u2019s children, including Ali Jayden, had been on the child protection register at the time of her death. A protection order was also in place preventing Armstrong from being in contact with or near the children due to his criminal history. Armstrong was also on probation for domestic violence offences. Judge Mr Justice McAlinden said the pair had taken a \"deliberate decision\" to ignore the protection plan in place by social services. He added that he wanted to send a message out to others in similar situations that \u201cthere will be consequences to those that breach them\u201d. A defence barrister for Armstrong said he was not in disagreement with the prosecution and that they accepted the defendant was responsible. \u201cAt the centre of this case is a young child that suffered a catastrophic fracture which was the result of a high impact blow caused by the defendant\u201d, the defence barrister said. He also outlined how Armstrong came from a \u201cremarkably dysfunctional\u201d background, growing up in care and being exposed to domestic violence and guardians with drug and alcohol addictions. The defence barrister said Armstrong\u2019s drug use resulted in him \u201closing control\u201d on the day that Ali Jayden was murdered. After submissions were made by the prosecution and defence, Mr Justice McAlinden said he needed time to reflect on what he heard and would sentence Dempsey and set a minimum tariff for Dempsey at a later date.",
    "Adopting as a single mum in my 40s changed my life\n\nJo decided to adopt in her 40s as a single woman\n\nA woman who feared she would never have children after two rounds of failed IVF in her 40s has said adopting a child has changed her life. Jo, from south Wales, registered to adopt as a single woman and welcomed her \"cheeky, handsome boy\" home 18 months later. She wants others to follow suit after figures showed the number of people registering to adopt dropped in Wales. The National Adoption Service (NAS) said between 150 and 170 adopters were being approved a year since the Covid pandemic, compared with 250 to 300 before.\n\nJo said she had always lived a full and happy life with friends and family, but also wanted a be a mum. It was her dad who encouraged her to register to adopt, a process which included interviews, home visits and social workers. She said despite the anxiety of waiting and the reservations she had being a single mother, her experience of adopting was \"magical\". \"It's not a race to get your family. This is to make your perfect family and to make sure the child is placed with you is best placed,\" she said. She added her fears disappeared the first time she met her son. \"He's very cheeky, he's tall, he's super sharp, putting words together. He's very, very clever. He's gorgeous, very handsome.\" She said those who were considering adoption should \"trust the process\".\n\nJo doesn't want to share her two-year old son's name or photo because she says it's his story to tell when he's old enough to understand it\n\nAccording to NAS, there are about 200 children waiting to be adopted, with anecdotal evidence suggesting some are not registering as prospective adopters because of the cost of living. NAS' director, Suzanne Griffiths, said there was more work to be done, despite progress. \"We've achieved a lot of successes over the last 10 years, not least of all the 3,000 plus children that we've placed over that period of time,\" she said. \"But the numbers of people expressing an interest in adoption is going down at the moment. We're not entirely sure why, some of that will be linked to things like cost of living.\"\n\nGuto says adopting a five-year old boy has been \"fantastic\"\n\nIn 2002, the law changed in the United Kingdom, allowing single people and same-sex couples to adopt children. According to NAS, single and LGBTQ+ adopters make up 10% and a quarter of adoptions in Wales respectively. Guto and Rhys, from Cardiff, said adopting their five-year old boy had brought joy to their lives. \"The past three years have been fantastic,\" said Guto. \"When I was coming out and coming to terms with my own sexuality, it was following same sex couples being able to get married and it was during the time that adoption became an option. \"Seeing that and coming to terms with my own sexuality, I was able to envisage myself being able to adopt.\" Guto added being able to share their journey with other same-sex couples has been \"fantastic\". \"It's changed our lives immeasurably, really. Our lives have been totally transformed,\" he said.",

I don't think Salah is distracted at all - Slot\n\nLiverpool forward Mohamed Salah is not being distracted by contract talks and speculation about his future, says manager Arne Slot. Salah, whose current contract expires at the end of the season, told reporters he was \"disappointed\" at not being offered a new deal and is \"probably more out than in\". \"The only thing I can say is, if I look at my line-ups, Mo is more in than out,\" said Slot. \"I don't think he's distracted at all. I haven't seen that after the United game [in September] where he had some comments, I haven't seen it after a post you told me about, he just kept on scoring. \"If you would have been at the Axa [training ground] today, I don't think any player spoke about it, at least not when I was there.\" The 32-year-old is Liverpool's top scorer this season with 12 goals in all competitions, with his double in Sunday's win at Southampton moving the Reds eight points clear at the top of the Premier League. The Merseyside club face Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday before hosting Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. Slot added: \"Players are focused on the short term and that is Madrid and that is City. \"There is no distraction for him, the players and definitely not for me.\" As well as Salah, defender Trent Alexander-Arnold and club captain Virgil van Dijk are also out of contract at the end of the season. A club source told BBC Sport that contact between Liverpool and Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, is ongoing and has been positive.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said Salah was \"selfish\" for commenting publicly about his future. Asked about Carragher's comments, Slot said: \"I focus a bit more on what else he said. He said he was one of the five best players Liverpool have ever had and I completely agree with him, which is not an easy thing because we have had so many great players at this club. \"I don't think it distracts Mo at all - maybe even brings the best out of him. Like I have said already a few times, my main focus is the next game. I talked to Mo about what I expect from him like I do all the other players. He is in a good place at the moment.\" Speaking at the same news conference Reds defender Andy Robertson said the speculation is \"nothing the players can get involved in\". He said: \"All I can say is Mo is the ultimate professional. That goes for all three of the players - Mo, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk - who are all in a similar position. \"They are so focused on the next game, on training and have been leaders this year. For us in the changing room, if they can do that, we can do that and not get distracted.\"",
    "From pub job and PlayStation to writing an award-winning play\n\nNathan Queeley-Dennis says he, like his character, was \"lost in a cloud of where I was headed in life\"\n\nOne day when Nathan Queeley-Dennis was supposed to be busy lugging beer kegs in the cellar of the pub where he worked, he was instead writing his first script on his phone. It went on to win Britain's biggest playwriting prize, is now on tour, and is being turned into a TV show. A morning shift at the Birmingham pub where Queeley-Dennis had worked since he was 16 would often involve lifting and carrying that day's deliveries. For that task, his bosses allowed a couple of hours. \"You can do it in two hours,\" he says. \"But I've always been pretty strong, so I knew I could do it in about 15-20 minutes if I really hustled. \"Then I could just sit on my phone downstairs in the cellar, have a drink, have my breakfast and, like, chill.\" And in 2018, he used the downtime to bash out the opening scene of a script on his notes app. Four years later, Bullring Techno Makeout Jamz won the prestigious Bruntwood Prize for Playwriting. The year after that, it got glowing reviews at the Edinburgh Fringe. Now, it's just kicked off a national tour in Queeley-Dennis's home city - which looms large in the story - and has been snapped up by a TV production company headed by Peaky Blinders mastermind Steven Knight.\n\nThe Guardian praised his \"light-footed charm [and] sure comic timing\" in Edinburgh\n\nAfter finishing drama school, Queeley-Dennis was trying to make it as an actor when he started looking for a solo script to perform in a monologue competition. But he couldn't find anything that suited him as a young, black Brummie, he says. Hence he holed up in the pub cellar to write his own. His short monologue introduced a hugely likeable young man called Nathaniel, who is eternally optimistic about finding love despite none of his many dates ever working out. Queeley-Dennis received good feedback but didn't win the competition. He went back to working in the pub, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. \"One time I was playing on my PlayStation and I was like, I've been playing Fifa and Pro Evolution Soccer for about 15 years, and I thought, I feel absolutely nothing right now. So I just put it down.\" He opened his laptop, typed up the script from his phone, and kept on writing. \"In the space of an hour and a half, I had 10 pages of dialogue, and I looked and I finished, and I'd never felt so alive in my whole entire life. \"Looking back on it, I think I was just yearning for some sort of creative release. I think I had so much creative energy, and I never used it.\"\n\nQueeley-Dennis eventually expanded the story into a full show. We learn that the character Nathaniel studied fine art and dreams of being \"a hybrid, edgy, sexy kind of Brum town Basquiat with a garnish of Banksy\", but is in fact stuck working in a call centre. The plot isn't autobiographical, the 29-year-old says, but the themes are. \"I'm not good at art. I've never worked a day in a call centre in my life. But have I spent time working in a job that I maybe felt was unfulfilling just to try and get by? Yes. \"Did it eat away at my soul? Yes. And did I waste my time putting my energy into things that weren't what I actually wanted to do, because I was lost in a cloud of where I was headed in life? One hundred per cent. \"So I always say the emotional journey of the character is very truthful. \"But actually, a lot of people at any point in their 20s have felt those feelings - that thing of, OK, you're out in the world now, and what am I going to do?\"\n\nThe show had a run at London's Royal Court after the Edinburgh Fringe\n\nIn 2023, Queeley-Dennis took Bullring Techno Makeout Jamz to Edinburgh, where The Stage's critic said, external shows \"do not get much more exuberant or entertaining than this\", and WhatsOnStage said, external it \"positively brims with good humour and warmth\". The Guardian described it, external as \"a refreshingly healthy portrait of masculinity\", which Queeley-Dennis \"performs with such light-footed charm, sure comic timing and sweet sense of male romanticism that he has the audience in his hands\". It's premature to predict that it will follow Fleabag and Baby Reindeer as a one-person Fringe comedy-drama that becomes a TV hit, but it could well end up on that trajectory. The screen rights were snapped up by the Kudos Knight production stable, and a series is being pitched to commissioners. Knight is on a mission to build on the success of Peaky Blinders by bringing through more Birmingham talent and stories. Queeley-Dennis similarly believes the city has been neglected on stage and screen. \"I just feel like people shy away or pretend Birmingham doesn't exist. We see things set in Manchester, we see things set in Yorkshire, we see things set in London,\" he says. \"I just think it's the best city in the world and there's such a specific energy and verve and humour that we have. Everyone here has a certain humour, a certain attitude and mindset and chip on the shoulder we all share. \"Every city has its own different nuances. I think Birmingham does, and more stories need to honour that and show that.\"\n\nPerhaps the city is not as forward about bigging itself up as somewhere like Manchester. \"I think people from Birmingham just get on with things to ourselves,\" Queeley-Dennis agrees. \"Over the last two years, I've had to get a lot better at talking myself up. Yeah, we might need to talk ourselves up more. Honestly, there are so many great artists in the city.\" He's more comfortable talking with pride about the friends he would hang out with at creative events six or seven years ago, and who are now, like him, making their breakthroughs. \"There is a community of us, and now we've all branched out into different mediums of work,\" he says. \"There are actors on Netflix shows, writers like myself, artistic directors of long-standing companies, and producers and stuff like that. We were just hanging out back in 2017-18 all together.\" He namechecks actors including Corey Weekes and Keiren Hamilton-Amos, screenwriter Ameir Brown, and Women & Theatre artistic director Adaya Henry. \"There are so many names. I do think there is a mini creative renaissance within the city, and artists from the city that people maybe aren't aware of yet. \"But I think in a few years' time, we'll all be all over the place, and I'm trying to just be a part of that.\" Bullring Techno Makeout Jamz is at Birmingham Hippodrome until Saturday, 5 October, then on tour throughout October and November.",
    "Man jailed for pushing postman on to Tube tracks\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Brwa Shorsh is seen shoving Tadeusz Potoczek onto the track\n\nA man who pushed a postman in front of an oncoming Tube train has been jailed for life, with a minimum of eight years. Brwa Shorsh, 24, was found guilty of attempted murder after shoving Tadeusz Potoczek, 61, off the southbound Victoria line platform at Oxford Circus station on 3 February. The victim, who narrowly missed touching the live rail, was helped off the tracks by a passerby who was awarded \u00a31,000 by the judge at Inner London Crown Court. The Crown Prosecution Service said it was \"impossible to imagine anything that could ever justify pushing anyone in front of a train like that\".\n\nBrwa Shorsh was sentenced at Inner London Crown Court\n\nShorsh, a Kurdish migrant who gave evidence through an interpreter, had claimed he was \"angry\" at Mr Potoczek as he felt as though the postman had given him a dirty look. Maxine Jarrousse-Jones, of the CPS, said: \"Brwa Shorsh attempted to kill the victim by deliberately and forcefully pushing him into the path of an approaching train. \u201cIf not for the victim\u2019s quick-thinking, the courage of the other passenger who came to his rescue and the speed at which the train driver brought the train to a halt, Shorsh\u2019s actions could have cost the victim his life. \u201cCommuters should be able to travel freely without fear of violence or harm and I hope this sentencing is a reminder that such acts will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted as fully as the law allows.\u201d\n\nDet Ch Insp Sam Painter said: \u201cI am pleased with today\u2019s result and wish to thank everyone involved in the investigation who quickly worked to identify and arrest Shorsh. \u201cAs reflected by the life sentence handed down, Shorsh is an extremely dangerous individual who is thankfully now off the streets and behind bars. \u201cIt is hoped that this will provide some comfort and closure to his victim who continues to work toward his recovery from this terrifying encounter with Shorsh.\u201d",
    "Mayor and 15 others killed in Israeli strike on Lebanon council meeting\n\nNabatieh's governor said the number of dead could rise as the rubble was still being searched\n\nThe UN\u2019s special coordinator for Lebanon has criticised Israel after air strikes on municipal buildings in the southern city of Nabatieh killed the mayor and 15 other people. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert called the killing of mayor Ahmad Kahil \u201calarming\u201d and said any violations of international humanitarian law were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. At least five of those killed in Wednesday's strike were municipal staff co-ordinating aid for civilians remaining in the area, Nabatiyeh Governor Howaida Turk told the BBC. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying it had \"intentionally\" targeted a council meeting.\n\nThe attack was the most significant against a Lebanese state building since the latest escalation in fighting, which began about two weeks ago, and has raised concerns about the safety of the country\u2019s state infrastructure. A spokesman for the Israeli military said its forces had launched raids targeting dozens of Hezbollah targets in the area and destroyed a tunnel used by the Iran-backed group. \"We know that Hezbollah many times takes advantage of civilian facilities,\" Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon said at a meeting of the UN in New York City on Wednesday. Turk, the governor, said that while the majority of Nabatieh residents had already left the area following heavy Israeli air strikes, the mayor and other municipal employees had stayed behind to help those who remained. \u201cThis is just like strikes all over Lebanon,\u201d she said. \u201cThey [Israel] have hit civilians, Red Cross, civil defence. Now they have targeted a government building. It is unacceptable. It is a massacre.\u201d Previous strikes on Nabatieh over the past few days have destroyed historic buildings, including an Ottoman-era market dating to 1910.\n\nWednesday's attacks on Nabatieh have raised concerns about the safety of state infrastructure in Lebanon\n\nIsrael also launched at least one air strike against Beirut on Wednesday. The strike, which hit the southern suburb of Dahieh, was the first on the Lebanese capital in five days. It came after a reported intervention by the US in which it urged restraint over the bombing of the capital. Residents of Dahieh had begun to return to the area over the past few days, taking advantage of the apparent pause in bombing to check on their homes and retrieve clothes and other possessions. Several told the BBC on Wednesday that the area resembled a ghost town, with rubble and debris from buildings littering the streets. The strike on Dahieh came just hours after a US state department spokesman Matthew Miller publicly expressed concern over the \u201cscope and nature\u201d of Israel\u2019s bombing of Beirut. Mr Miller said the state department\u2019s concerns had been \"made clear to the government of Israel\". An Israeli military spokesman said that prior to striking Beirut, \u201cnumerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including advancing warnings to the population in the area\u201d. Israel has faced criticism this week over its warnings, which Amnesty International has called \u201cinadequate\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d. The human rights charity said the warnings did \u201cnot absolve Israel of its obligations under international humanitarian law\u201d. Israel has expanded its air campaign in recent days, launching an unexpected strike in the far north of the country on Monday. The strike, which destroyed a large residential home that had been rented by a displaced family in the Christian village of Aitou, killed 23 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Twelve of the dead were women and two children, the ministry said. The UN human rights office called for an investigation into the Aitou strike, saying it raised \"real concerns\" with respect to international humanitarian law.",
    "Jung Woo-sung is an A-lister in South Korea\u2019s film industry\n\nA South Korean actor\u2019s revelation that he fathered a child with a woman to whom he is not married has triggered a national debate over celebrity conduct and non-traditional family structures. Jung Woo-sung, a 51-year-old A-lister in South Korea\u2019s film industry, confirmed via his agency on Sunday that he is the father of 35-year-old model Moon Ga-bi\u2019s newborn son. While Jung pledged to \u201cfulfil his responsibilities\u201d as the father, his silence on whether he plans to marry Moon drew fierce backlash in the conservative country where births outside marriage are seen as taboo. But some progressive voices have defended Jung, noting a shift in South Korea\u2019s attitudes towards diverse family structures.\n\nMoon announced her child\u2019s birth via Instagram on Friday, without mentioning the father, describing the pregnancy as \u201cunexpected\u201d and saying she had been \u201ccompletely unprepared for the sudden news\u201d. Two days later, Jung\u2019s agency Artist Company released a statement confirming that \u201cthe baby Moon revealed on her social media is Jung Woo-sung\u2019s son\u201d. The statement further noted that Jung and Moon were \u201cdiscussing the best way to raise the child\u201d. It triggered outrage that quickly spread across the country, triggering a slate of opinion pieces in tabloids, spurring online debate and eliciting comments from national politicians. Online, the response was largely critical towards Jung, whose prolific film career has made him a household name in South Korea. Many commentators seemed to believe the actor had tarnished an otherwise upstanding and squeaky clean image, with some expressing disappointment that the former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ambassador \u201ccan\u2019t accept his own child\u201d. \u201cJung Woo-sung is pretending to be a good guy saying he will fulfil all his duty\u2026 A child does not grow on money alone,\u201d wrote one commenter on Naver News, South Korea\u2019s largest news aggregate website. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem not marrying after having a child. It\u2019s that he pretended to be such an ethical person so far,\u201d wrote another. Speaking to conservative news outlet JoongAng, an unnamed lawmaker from the right-wing People Power Party described Jung\u2019s decision to have a child outside marriage as \u201csomething unthinkable in this country of social mores\". \u201cNo matter how much the times are changing, Korea\u2019s tradition and public sentiment must be kept (righteous),\u201d the lawmaker said. A recent social survey by South Korea\u2019s statistics agency found that 37% of people believed it was acceptable to have a child outside marriage - an almost 15% increase since 2012. Of those who said marriage was necessary, more than 72% were above the age of 60 - with younger respondents increasingly less likely to take that view.\n\nOther lawmakers have defended Jung, with Lee So-young, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea, saying that \u201cdeciding to live with someone is a deeply personal and existential choice\u201d. \u201cTo assume that simply having a child obligates people to marry and take on the duties of cohabitation and mutual support feels suffocating,\u201d Lee wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being \u2018normal\u2019\u2026 [But] even if society appears to have a standard of \u2018normal\u2019, every life is unique in its own way. \u201cPerhaps a better society is one that accepts and respects such differences without judgment,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s what I believe.\u201d Kyunghyang, a progressive major newspaper, put out an editorial piece noting that while some voices have pushed for traditional values, \"also rising is the voice that our society must think of the diverse shapes families take\". \"It makes one hope that celebrities having babies outside of marriage, like Jung and Moon, will help change the public view which today is against [such] births.\" South Korea has a notoriously high-pressure entertainment industry, with celebrities often held to inordinately high social standards and placed under extreme scrutiny.\n\u2022 None How jealous K-pop super fans try to dictate their idols' private lives",
    "UN climate talks 'no longer fit for purpose' say key experts\n\nRecent deadly floods in Valencia, Spain, were made worse by climate change, scientists say\n\nThe United Nations' COP climate talks are \"no longer fit for purpose\" and need an urgent overhaul, key experts including a former UN secretary general and former UN climate chief have said. In a letter to the UN, external, senior figures say countries should not host the talks if they don\u2019t support the phase out of fossil energy. This week the Azerbaijani president told world leaders gathered in his country for COP29 that natural gas was a \u201cgift from God\u201d and he shouldn\u2019t be blamed for bringing it to market. That came days after the BBC reported that a senior Azerbaijani official appeared to have used his role at COP to arrange a meeting to discuss potential fossil fuel deals.\n\nThe UN\u2019s climate talks have made significant progress in recent years, despite the fact that unanimous agreement is needed among almost 200 countries to take action. The Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015, outlines a long-term plan to rein in rising temperatures, as countries strive to keep that rise under 1.5C this century. They have also agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and to treble renewable power by 2030. But while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis. \"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories. They include former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon, former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and former president of Ireland Mary Robinson. The authors are concerned that the current COP process is not able to make change happen quickly or able to force countries to act. At last year\u2019s COP28 meeting in Dubai all countries agreed to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels in energy systems.\u201d But 12 months later emissions of warming gases have increased once again, up by almost 1%. Scientists say these emissions need to fall by 42% by the end of this decade to avoid a global temperature rise in excess of 1.5C, considered the threshold to far more dangerous impacts than we are seeing at present. One of the authors of the letter, Christiana Figueres, later qualified her support for reforms, saying they had been \u201cmisinterpreted in today\u2019s context.\u201d In a statement she said: \u201cThe COP process is an essential and irreplaceable vehicle for supporting the multilateral, multisectoral, systemic change we urgently need. Now more than ever. \u201cWe are committed allies to and advocates for this process \u2014 and lend our total support to positive efforts underway to further strengthen it for the new era of implementation we are entering into.\u201d\n\nThe UN has yet to comment on the letter. At the conference in Baku, negotiators from small island states were particularly concerned about any attempt to change the nature of the COP, where all countries are equal. They worry that if decisions are made among the big emitters at forums such as the G20 group of richer nations, their small island voice will be excluded. \u201cWe're not a part of those discussions,\u201d said Micahi Robertson who\u2019s an adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States at these talks. The letter has been prompted by growing concerns about some of the countries chosen to host COP talks and their ability to deliver a significant advance in the fight against rising temperatures. Just before the latest conference started, a secret recording showed the chief executive of Azerbaijan's COP29 team, Elnur Soltanov, discussing \"investment opportunities\" in the state oil and gas company with a man posing as a potential investor.\n\nAt the start of COP29, the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Ilham Aliyev, defended Azerbaijan\u2019s current exports of gas and plans to expand production by a third in the next decade. \u201cIt's a gift of God,\u201d he told an audience in Baku. \u201cEvery natural resource whether it's oil, gas, wind, sun, gold, silver, copper, all that are natural resources,\" he said. \"And countries should not be blamed for having them and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market because the market needs them, the people need them.\" The use of oil and gas are major causes of global warming, as they release planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide when they are burned. President Aliyev also hit out at France for carrying out colonialist \u201ccrimes\u201d and \u201chuman rights violations\u201d in overseas territories. Such strongly expressed views are extremely rare from the leader of a COP host, where the aim is to build consensus on how to tackle rising temperatures. The authors of the letter are also concerned by the selection process for hosting COPs. Azerbaijan followed on from another major oil producer, the United Arab Emirates, which held the conference in Dubai last year. The authors say that host countries \u201cmust demonstrate their high level of ambition to uphold the goals of the Paris agreement.\" They also want smaller, more frequent COPs with clear accountability for the promises that countries make.",
    "Taylor Swift held eight shows in London over the summer\n\nA police escort for Taylor Swift was not the result of \"undue influence\" from senior politicians attending the singer's London concerts, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said. The decision was made by senior police officers, although Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan were involved in talks about security around the US superstar's shows over the summer, Nandy said. Swift was given a motorbike convoy to protect her on the way to Wembley despite initial police reservations, the Sun reported., external Senior Labour politicians including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Khan and Nandy were given free tickets to Eras Tour shows.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of Swift's Vienna gigs, extra security was put in place\n\nA source close to the Home Secretary said: \"The London Taylor Swift concerts in August came immediately after the cancellation of her Vienna concerts, following the discovery of a terror plot which the CIA\u2019s deputy director said was designed to kill 'tens of thousands' of attendees, and which led to widespread questions about whether the London concerts would go ahead. \"They also came after a fortnight of serious and violent disorder in a number of British towns and cities, which followed the terrible attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport. \"In the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack on the Ariana Grande concert in 2017, security arrangements for events like these are taken extremely seriously. \"Indeed, the government will shortly legislate for Martyn\u2019s Law to improve the security of venues. \"We can make categorically clear that all operational decisions were made by the Metropolitan Police and they do not discuss security arrangements.\"\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday evening that Cooper attended the one of the concerts for free as tickets were given to her husband Ed Balls, a Good Morning Britain presenter. The source told the BBC she had tried to declare the ticket on her parliamentary register of interests but was told she was unable to because it was below \u00a3300, which is the threshold for declarations, and because it was gifted to her husband rather than to Cooper directly. The source said she subsequently contacted the Cabinet Office in September to try to include it in her ministerial declarations and had formally done so on Wednesday.\n\nLisa Nandy: \"The police made the decision. Ultimately, it is their decision and nobody else can make it\"\n\nEarlier, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"Neither the prime minister nor the home secretary, nor the mayor of London has the power to override the police on this matter. It is an operational decision for the police. \"They can put their own view. That's certainly the case. \"But you would expect the home secretary and the mayor of the city where this event is taking place, given the history of what had just happened in Vienna, to be involved in the conversation about security arrangements.\" A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said the force was \"operationally independent\". \"Our decision-making is based on a thorough assessment of threat, risk and harm and the circumstances of each case,\" the spokesperson said. The force added it would not comment on specific details of security arrangements.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson reiterated the Met Police's operational independence but said the mayor and home secretary would be involved in conversations on large-scale events. The spokesperson also quoted Swift's remarks after the foiled Vienna terror plot: \"I decided that all of my energy had to go toward helping to protect the nearly half a million people I had coming to see the shows in London. \"My team and I worked hand in hand with stadium staff and British authorities every day in pursuit of that goal, and I want to thank them for everything they did for us.\" The singer held three shows at Wembley Stadium in June and five in August. City Hall said it would not comment on the Met's security arrangements. The prime minister has paid back almost \u00a33,400 for four Taylor Swift tickets donated by Universal Music Group and two by the Football Association.\n\nThe concerts attracted hundreds of thousands of people over the eight dates",

    "Secret WW2 bravery of Welsh mum who survived Nazi Germany and saved a historic church\n\nMabel Wulff risked her life to protect the St Thomas \u00e0 Becket Church in Hamburg\n\nHidden away in a church in Hamburg is a plaque dedicated to a relatively unknown Welsh woman, outlining astonishing acts of bravery. Mabel Wulff from Newport lived in Nazi Germany - surviving years of Gestapo harassment and bravely fighting fires caused by falling bombs. The plaque says the St Thomas \u00e0 Becket Anglican Church, known as simply \"the English church\" for many years, would have been destroyed without her - after she hid its artwork to save it from damage and smothered fires as they started. She also sheltered people to save their lives. \"She\u2019s a part of history - Newport history and Hamburg history,\" says Eddie Wulff, Mabel\u2019s grandson who has spent the past few years trying to learn more about his grandmother\u2019s life. \"But very few in Wales seem to know about it. She was formidable.\"\n\nEddie Wulff, 82, believes his grandmother Mabel's actions should be remembered\n\nIt is a story that begins in Newport in 1909 when seamstress Mabel Phillips married Max Wulff, a German sailor. They couldn\u2019t have imagined the difficulties ahead, with Max setting up a restaurant on Alexandra Road in the Pill area of the city and the couple welcoming two sons in 1911 and 1913.\n\nMax and Mabel Wulff met and fell in love in Newport\n\nBut the family were separated, with Max seen as an enemy by the British government and sent to camps in Lancaster and on the Isle of Man.\n\nThis photo shows the horse and carriage used for Max and Mabel's wedding on Alexandra Road in Pill\n\nLife for Mabel and her sons Edward and Leonard became difficult, says Eddie. \"There was a lot of anti German feeling in Newport. They asked Mabel whether she would divorce Max because he was a German - she refused to do that.\" It was a feeling Eddie himself remembers, being in school in Newport at the end of the 1940s, where he recalled being called \"Nazi\" and \"Gestapo\". \u201cThey must have had it even worse\u201d he said.\n\nAs soon as World War One ended, Max wasn\u2019t allowed to return to Newport but sent back to Germany, where his young family would soon join him. \u201cThey had so much hassle - every stage of their life had been hard,\" Eddie said. That became apparent again in 1930s Hamburg. By then Mabel was the caretaker of \"the English church\", a Church of England church originally established because of the trade links between the city and the UK.\n\nThe English Church was rebuilt in the years after the war and reconsecrated as St Thomas a Becket Church in 1947\n\nOnce war broke out, an Anglican church with a British caretaker attracted numerous visits from the Gestapo. \"She said they really were nasty and they were strutting about. They were always looking for the Union flag and the British Legion flag which Mabel had hidden under the altar,\" Max said. \"They were bouncing about, asking where these things were - they were actually walking on top of them.\"\n\nMabel returned the flag she'd hidden to the British Legion in Hamburg at the end of the war - it is still used to this day\n\nAs a key port city, Hamburg was targeted by sustained bombing raids, most notably during Operation Gomorrah in 1943. In anticipation of this, Mabel hid and stored some of the beautiful paintings and engravings from the church, meaning they were saved from damage.\n\nThe painting above the altar, a copy of Raphael's Sistine Madonna dating back to 1838, was protected by Mabel during the War - it still hangs in the church.\n\nIt seemed there was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to protect the building during the raids, putting her life at risk. \u201cShe did put fires out, she went around and smothered them and got water and put them out on numerous occasions. She did save the church,\" said Eddie.\n\nThe church was badly damaged by bombings\n\nMabel Wulff also let families, displaced by the bombings, shelter in the church - again drawing the attention of the Gestapo. \"She was a good person. You didn\u2019t mess with Mabel - she was formidable,\" Eddie recalls.\n\nMabel was caretaker of the church for 40 years\n\nAt the end of the war, Mabel brought out the union flag she had hidden under the altar and draped it over the church\u2019s balcony as British troops entered the city. Mabel\u2019s bravery was noted by Church of England officials in 1947, thanking her for the \"great personal danger\" she put herself in. In 1956 she was awarded a British Empire Medal for her actions.\n\nThe plaque in St Thomas \u00e0 Becket church in Hamburg\n\nEven though Mabel returned to Newport in her later years and lived with Eddie and his family when he was a child, much of her story was unknown until relatively recently. \"You would have to drag it out of her. I am very proud of her. Most of it passed me by most of my life. I am in my 80s now and I'm just realising how important my grandmother was.\"",
    "Trump picks former WWE CEO and TV's Dr Oz for top roles\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has picked former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and his transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, as his nominee for education secretary. A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. Trump has criticised the Department of Education, and has promised to close it down - a job McMahon could be tasked with after Trump returns to the White House in January 2025. Trump earlier chose Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor and former TV host whose approaches have come under scrutiny, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nThe two selections on Tuesday - along with Trump's choice of Howard Lutnick for commerce secretary - follow a pattern of the president-elect nominating loyal supporters to top roles in his cabinet.\n\nMcMahon has a long history with the WWE and Trump, who used to make occasional appearances at wrestling matches. She co-founded Titan Sports with her husband in 1980, which then became the parent company of WWE later that decade. She resigned as CEO in 2009 in order to undertake a failed bid to run for the US Senate. McMahon has little background in education, but did serve on Connecticut state's board of education from 2009 until 2010. She is the board chair of the pro-Trump think tank the America First Policy Institute, meaning her confirmation in the Republican-majority Senate is likely. Hers is one of a number of top jobs that will require a vote of approval in the upper chamber of Congress. Announcing his pick on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \u201cFor the past four years, as the chair of the board at the America First Policy Institute, Linda has been a fierce advocate for parents\u2019 rights.\" He said McMahon would \"spearhead\" the effort to \"send education BACK TO THE STATES\", in reference to his pledge to close the department. Republicans have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as \"woke\" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race. They want the agency's authority handed to US states, which run most education matters.\n\nMcMahon was named in a lawsuit filed last month involving the WWE. It alleges that she, her husband and other company leaders knowingly allowed young boys to be abused by a ringside announcer who died in 2012. The McMahons deny wrongdoing. A lawyer representing the pair told USA Today Sports that the allegations are \"false claims\" that stem from \"absurd, defamatory and utterly meritless\" media reports.\n\nTrump earlier picked Mehmet Oz to run the powerful agency that oversees the healthcare of millions of Americans. Oz, who was selected to lead the CMS, trained as a surgeon before finding fame on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the early 2000s. Oz has been criticised by experts for promoting what they called bad health advice about weight loss drugs and \"miracle\" cures, and suggesting malaria drugs as a cure for Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. \u201cThere may be no physician more qualified and capable than Dr Oz to make America healthy again,\" Trump said in a statement. The Trump transition team said in a statement that Oz \"will work closely with [health secretary nominee] Robert F Kennedy Jr to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake\". Like McMahon, Oz will need to be confirmed by the Senate next year before he officially takes charge of the agency. The CMS oversees the country\u2019s largest healthcare programs, providing coverage to more than 150 million Americans. The agency regulates health insurance and sets policy that guides the prices that doctors, hospitals and drug companies are paid for medical services. In 2023, the US government spent more than $1.4tn (\u00a31.1tn) on Medicaid and Medicare combined, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump said in a statement that Oz would \u201ccut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency\u201d. The Republican Party platform pledged to increase transparency, choice and competition and expand access to healthcare and prescription drugs. Oz, 64, trained as a cardiothoracic surgeon \u2013 specialising in operations on the heart and lungs \u2013 and worked at New York City\u2019s Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University. After he appeared in dozens of Oprah segments, he started The Dr Oz Show, where he doled out health advice to viewers. But the line between promotion and science on the show was not always clear, and Oz has recommended homeopathy, alternative medicine and other treatments that critics have called \u201cpseudoscience\u201d. He was criticised during Senate hearings in 2014 for endorsing unproven pills that he said would \u201cliterally flush fat from your system\u201d and \u201cpush fat from your belly\u201d. During those hearings Oz said he never sold any specific dietary supplements on his show. But he has publicly endorsed products off air and his financial ties to health care companies were revealed in fillings made during his 2022 run for the US Senate in Pennsylvania. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Oz promoted the anti-malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which experts say are ineffective against the virus.",

    "Eryri National Park Authority has referred to Wales' tallest mountain solely as Yr Wyddfa since 2022\n\nWales' tallest mountain will continue to be referred to solely by its Welsh name by its local national park authority after the move was deemed to be a success. Eryri National Park Authority voted to use Yr Wyddfa, rather than Snowdon, and Eryri, rather than Snowdonia, in all official communication in November 2022. Surveys from the summer found strong support for the move from locals and visitors, the authority said. But there were also concerns over pronunciation and some visitors being \"unaware of the longstanding Welsh names and may mistakenly believe they are new\".\n\nAccording to a report that will be presented to the authority on Wednesday, many businesses and media outlets had also started referring to the mountain and national park by their Welsh names. The authority said this had resulted in \"increasing consistency and visibility of the Welsh identity associated with the park\". Gwynedd councillor John Pughe Roberts had earlier put forward a motion asking the park to stop using Snowdon and Snowdonia, claiming many were \"complaining that people are changing house names, rock names, renaming the mountains\". Citing the use of Welsh names \"aligned with the authority's commitment to promoting the Welsh language\" and of \"heritage preservation\", officers also reported the move represented a \"unique selling point\" which \"sets it apart from other UK national parks\".\n\nChallenges have also been raised, including some visitors mistakenly believing the Welsh names are new, leading to \"some resistance and confusion\". The report will also recommend pronunciation guides should be made available. A proposal has also been made to update the authority's logo, which still includes the word Snowdonia.",

    "HSBC splits bank between East and West in major overhaul\n\nHSBC's new boss has announced a major overhaul of the bank's structure, splitting geographically into eastern and western markets amid increasing geopolitical tensions and a need to cut costs. The bank said that it was simplifying operations by splitting into four key units, which will see its commercial and institutional banking divisions merged. The changes are set to take effect from 2025. HSBC also announced a reshuffle in its leadership ranks, with the appointment of its first female finance chief in the bank's 159-year history.\n\nPam Kaur has been with HSBC since 2013 and is currently the bank's chief risk and compliance officer\n\nIts new chief executive Georges Elhedery said he wants to \"unleash our full potential and drive success into the future.\" Under the plans, the bank will create separate business units in the UK and Hong Kong. There will also be two other operations: \"corporate and institutional banking\" and \"international wealth and premier banking\". Business in these operations will fall into either \u201ceastern markets\u201d, which includes the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East, or \u201cwestern markets\u201d, covering the UK, continental Europe and the Americas. \"The new structure will result in a simpler, more dynamic, and agile organisation as we focus on executing against our strategic priorities, which remain unchanged,\" Mr Elhedery said. \"The creation of a new international wealth and premier banking division signals HSBC\u2019s intent to be the bank of choice for the rich,\" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.

    "Jafer Chohan made his debut for Yorkshire in 2023 after emerging from the South Asian Cricket Academy\n\nLeg-spinner Jafer Chohan has earned his first England call-up for the white-ball tour of the West Indies, while Jos Buttler returns as captain. Chohan, 22, has taken 22 wickets in 23 T20 Blast matches for Yorkshire, including 17 in 10 games in 2024, and is the first graduate of the South Asian Cricket Academy (SACA) to be named in an England squad. Buttler has been out since August with a calf injury, with Harry Brook and Phil Salt leading the one-day international and T20 sides in his absence against Australia in September. It will be his first series in charge following a review of England's set-up after June's T20 World Cup, which saw head coach Matthew Mott step down. The first of three ODIs against West Indies takes place on 31 October in Antigua, and is followed by five T20s. The same squad has been named for both series, with Hampshire fast bowler John Turner and Warwickshire all-rounder Dan Mousley the other uncapped players alongside Chohan. A further two players, who are yet to be named, will join the tour from the England Test squad, who finish their tour of Pakistan on 28 October. England drew the T20 series against Australia but lost the ODI series 3-2, as they continue to rebuild after the departure of Mott, the retirement of all-rounder Moeen Ali and and the absence of experienced players including Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Mark Wood. Marcus Trescothick will be head coach with Brendon McCullum taking over in January 2025.\n\nA first England call-up is the latest accolade in what has been a whirlwind two years for London-born Chohan. In 2022, he was playing club cricket in Loughborough with the assumption that his dream of playing professionally was over, having failed to sign a contract with his childhood county Middlesex. But his work in a net bowling session for England's T20 squad caught the attention of Joe Root, followed by his introduction to SACA, which led to a first deal with Yorkshire. In 2023, after making an impression in the T20 Blast, Chohan was selected as a wildcard pick by Southern Brave for The Hundred. \"It feels like an absolute dream to be selected. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve worked for my whole life,\" Chohan told Yorkshire CCC. \"For me this is a really good opportunity to be around some of the best players in the world, learn as much as I can and just really sharpen up my game as much as possible.\" Chohan credits SACA for giving him a second chance and for showing that the traditional route of progress from a county academy set-up is not the only option for players. Having to learn to love the game again after his struggle to secure a county deal initially, Chohan studied leg-spin intensely on YouTube to develop his craft and then gained valuable advice and teaching from England's Adil Rashid and his brother, Amar. \"My skillset is a very unique one and a bit different to what England has had before,\" added Chohan. \"I feel very confident in my game and I like to express myself as a person with how I bowl and I think that works to my strength. Being in this new environment will be a really good opportunity to thrive.\" Chohan was namechecked by Rashid last week during a BBC Sport interview and said: \"There\u2019s a few around the circuit, they\u2019re in competition, which is healthy competition, they can compete to become that number one spinner. \"Hopefully you get that competition of somebody who\u2019s very good and can become the best.\"\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "Brotherhood of Man's Lee Sheridan, Sandra Stevens, Nicky Stevens and Martin Lee pictured in 1976\n\nSinger and songwriter Martin Lee, a member of pop group Brotherhood of Man, has died aged 77. A statement released by the PA News Agency and posted on the band's Facebook page said Lee died on Sunday from heart failure following a short illness. Brotherhood of Man were best known for winning the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with Save Your Kisses for Me. The song reached number one in more than 30 countries and became one of the best-selling Eurovision singles in the contest's history.\n\n\"He will be sadly missed by his fellow band members Nicky Stevens, Lee Sheriden and especially Sandra Stevens to whom he had been married for 45 happy years,\" the statement said. Lee joined Brotherhood of Man in 1972 and served as lead vocalist and guitarist. Save Your Kisses For Me won the Eurovision Song Contest four years later in the Netherlands. The song topped the table with 164 points, 17 points ahead of second-placed France.

Scott Jeff, 24, had been in the life of Isabella Jonas-Wheildon for just 36 days before her body was found on 30 June last year. The court heard Jeff and Isabella's mother, Chelsea Gleason-Mitchell, 24, had moved her body around in a pushchair at a temporary housing unit in Sidegate Lane, Ipswich. Jeff was found guilty of murder, while Gleason-Mitchell was found not guilty of murder, but she admitted causing or allowing the death of a child.\n\nJeff and Gleason-Mitchell, previously from Bedfordshire, denied murder and were standing trial. The pair had arrived at the temporary housing in Ipswich on 19 June, 11 days before Isabella's body was found.

    "Going solo after leaving one of the UK's biggest podcasts\n\nMilena Sanchez hosted The Receipts podcast for seven years before suddenly quitting in 2023\n\nJust over a year ago, Milena Sanchez suddenly left one of the UK's most successful podcasts in a split that seemed to shock everyone - even her co-hosts. For seven years, she'd built The Receipts alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye, collecting more than 100,000 weekly listeners on the way. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Milena says quitting was a difficult decision but her mental health had deteriorated to a point where she couldn't carry on. \"It wasn't one I took lightly - even though it might have seemed like that,\" says Milena, 33. Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years. There were also rumours - denied by the podcasters - that Milena was bullied and squeezed out of the group. \"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.\n\nThe Receipts, which started in 2016 and signed a lucrative exclusive deal with Spotify in 2019, has about 100,000 weekly listeners on Spotify. \"Financially, I could've shut my mouth and stayed and collected the bag,\" says Milena. \"But for me, it's not about that. It meant more to me - my mental health, my integrity and who I am as a person, and to not sell something that wasn't true. \"It's not easy, and especially when I do have a daughter that depends on me.\" Milena says her daughter, who was just one year old when The Receipts started and is now almost 10, helped her find the courage to quit.\n\nMilena says she was scared to return to podcasting, knowing she would not have the same team and support around her\n\n\"I really had to sit down with myself and ask, if my daughter came to me with the same predicament, what would be my response to her?\" Milena says. \"My response wouldn't be to stay somewhere just because of money. It would just be, 'choose yourself'. \"You only live once and I know it sounds so clich\u00e9d, but you can't be stuck in a space where you just don't feel happy.\" Milena says her year since quitting The Receipts has been a \"whirlwind\". She says she left London to live in the countryside and pursue music and writing, but realised she was missing podcasting. \"There's been a lot of reflecting, a lot of self-analysing,\" says Milena. \"Ultimately I had to say to myself: I love speaking, my voice is very needed.\"\n\nMilena says she had to overcome a lot of self-doubt before launching her own solo podcast. \"I was scared to put this podcast out. \"I felt like I'm just going to be in my home talking. It doesn't feel big enough, it doesn't feel glitzy enough. \"But it doesn't matter where it's coming from,\" Milena says she told herself. \"You started from from the ground before, so let's go again.\" Since she launched solo project Milena's Diary at the end of September, she says she's been \"overwhelmed\" by the response. \"It reminded me, 'this is why you are here. This is your purpose'.\" But \"it was very difficult to start again from the ground up,\" she says - and definitely a change of pace from The Receipts. There, \"I had a team,\" she says. \"We had production, we had social media people, somebody that edited the podcasts. \"All I had to do was turn up and talk and that's it. \"Now doing this solo, I'm doing everything myself. I'm a one-man band.\"\n\nMilena previously said there had been \"years of a rift\" between her and Tolani before she quit\n\nPreviously, she was one of three presenters bouncing off each other and not having that has been a \"hard\" transition. \"I really do enjoy being on episodes with other people because you do bounce back, there's other stories that are triggered in your mind and it's nice,\" she says. \"But I feel like having that time alone to self-reflect and to just talk is also very important.\"\n\nMilena says she uses her podcast \"as therapy\" and she feels more authentically herself than ever. She's also spent the past year releasing music leaning into her Colombian heritage and queer identity. \"My culture is so ingrained in me, even though I was born in London,\" she says. \"And I'm a queer woman so I'm going to talk on that openly and very proudly.\" Looking back on the past year, \"I feel so much happier,\" Milena says. \"I am in a space where I have done so much work on myself, so much self-reflection and taking accountability for things I don't think that I would've a couple of years back. \"I'm just so grateful to myself for making the decisions I have made.\" And despite the public statements earlier this year, Milena says she only wants the best for her former co-hosts Tolani and Audrey, who continued The Receipts as a duo. \"I always wish the girls the absolute best,\" she says. \"And they're doing really well.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "Austria far right shunned for coalition despite winning election\n\nKarl Nehammer is the leader of the conservative People\u2019s Party\n\nAustria\u2019s President, Alexander Van der Bellen, has asked the leader of the conservative People\u2019s Party (OVP) and incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer to form a coalition government - despite the fact that the far-right Freedom Party won the general election last month. The anti-immigrant, Russia-friendly Freedom Party came top in the election in September with almost 29% of the vote and its leader, Herbert Kickl, said he should lead the next government. However all the other parties have ruled out forming a coalition with him. Following talks among the three largest parties, President Alexander Van der Bellen said it was clear that Kickl \u201cwould not be able to find a coalition partner who would make him Chancellor.\u201d\n\n\"The parliamentary election on 29 September is not a race in which the party that crosses the finish line first automatically gets to form the government,\" the 80-year-old president said in a televised address. \"If a party wants to govern alone, it must clear the 50% hurdle. It is not sufficient to reach 10, 20 or 30%.\" Van der Bellen said he has asked the current Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, whose conservative party came second with 26.3% to hold coalition talks with the Social Democrats, who came third, with 21%. However a coalition between the conservatives and the Social Democrats would only have a majority of one seat. In a statement to the media, Nehammer said that in order to ensure a stable parliamentary majority, a third partner would be needed. That third party could be either the Greens or the liberal Neos. Nehammer said he couldn\u2019t tell \u201cwhether these talks and negotiations will actually lead to the formation of a government.\" \"What I can promise you, however, is that I will act in the spirit of stability, reliability and responsibility for our country.\" In a statement on Facebook, Herbert Kickl said that the President had broken with the \u201ctried and tested normal processes\u201d of Austria\u2019s republic, by not entrusting the winner of the election with the task of forming a government. \u201cThis might seem like a slap in the face for many of you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I promise you: the last word has not been spoken.

    "Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators have been detained by police in Amsterdam after defying a ban on public protests in the Dutch capital. Hundreds gathered in Dam Square on Sunday, calling for an end to the conflict in Gaza and expressing dissent towards the ban. Demonstrations were temporarily banned by the mayor after Israeli football fans were targeted in what she called \"hit-and-run\" attacks on Thursday night after a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax Amsterdam. The Israeli government has advised its citizens to \"categorically avoid\" Israeli sports and cultural events while abroad - specifically the football match between France and Israel in Paris on Thursday.\n\nAuthorities say Thursday's attacks - which caused five people to be hospitalised - were motivated by antisemitism as the fans were sought out across the city. The violence - which was condemned by leaders in Europe, the US and in Israel - has led to at least 62 arrests. The outcry was exacerbated by the attacks occurring on the eve of commemorations of the Nazi pogroms against German Jews that took place in November 1938. Three-quarters of Jewish people in the Netherlands were murdered during the Holocaust in World War Two. Amsterdam police said there had also been trouble the night before the match. Police chief Peter Holla said there had been incidents \"on both sides\", including Israeli supporters removing a Palestinian flag from a wall and setting it alight, and attacking a taxi. The city's Mayor Femke Halsema announced a ban on public assembly on Friday lasting at least until the end of the weekend, deeming the city a \"high-risk security area\". But protesters on Sunday argued they should be free to voice their disapproval of Israel's actions in Gaza and the actions of the Maccabi supporters.\n\n\"This protest has nothing to do with antisemitism,\" Alexander van Stokkum, one of the demonstrators, told the AFP news agency on Sunday. \"It is against Israeli hooligans who were destroying our city.\" Others told a Reuters journalist: \"We refuse to let the charge of antisemitism be weaponised to suppress Palestinian resistance.\" The news agency reported that more than 100 people were detained for attending the protest. Police in Amsterdam confirmed there had been arrests, but have yet to say how many. Following the protest ban, Dutch activist Frank van der Linde applied for an urgent permit so Sunday's demonstration could go ahead. On X, he said that he wanted to protest what he described as \"the genocide in Gaza\", adding: \"We will not let our right to demonstrate be taken away.\" Mr Van der Linde was overruled by Amsterdam's district court, which wrote on Sunday that \"the mayor has rightly determined that there is a ban on demonstrating in the city this weekend\". Dutch national newspaper De Telegraaf reports Mr Van der Linde was among those arrested. The Israeli embassy in the Netherlands earlier warned Israelis in Amsterdam to avoid Dam square, saying the event \"may flare up into significant violent incidents\". Israel's National Security Council has told its citizens to avoid public demonstrations \"of any kind\" and conceal \"anything that could identify you as Israeli/Jewish\", citing Thursday's attacks. \"Preparations to harm Israelis have been identified in several European cities, including Brussels (Belgium), major cities in the UK, Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Paris,\" it claimed. Paris's police chief has pledged that 4,000 officers would be deployed in the stadium and across the French capital for the Nations League match on 14 November.",
    "Emma wants to find friends to talk about \"really weird stuff\" like her love of time travel fiction\n\nThe day Emma Shores was diagnosed with autism has become such a defining moment in her adult life that she celebrates it like a \"second birthday\". The first thing on her mind when she got the news was making friends with other people living with autism, people she felt might truly understand her for the first time in her life. \"I thought maybe I'll feel less like an alien,\" she said. But things were not that easy. Emma had been in her mid-20s, living in London, and following her dream of becoming a primary school teacher when she had what she describes as a \"major meltdown\". Her life derailed, she was taken in by mental health services, misdiagnosed as having a mental illness, given medication and therapy.\n\nEmma moved away to be with family in rural Wales - and then by chance during a therapy session, she said someone spotted she might have autism instead. It meant that by the point she was ready to understand herself and looking for friends to help her navigate her new world - she was living in a rural town, far away from most of what she knew.\n\nEmma is turning down the lights in the local cafe for her group's first meeting\n\n\"After the diagnosis I remember I started feeling really happy,\" said the 33-year-old. \"But there was also a bit of grief too, because I wasn't going to be this person I'd had the idea of being.\" Emma tried looking for groups that might help her make friends. She had also just become a mum, so tried parenting groups as well but found them loud and overstimulating. Then she heard about a new project designed to encourage people with autism to start their own social clubs. It appealed to her straightaway. \"For me, feeling alone was like having a native language that's different to everyone else around you,\" said Emma. \"I think the main reason I want to start a club is to help others, to make my son proud one day. I also don't want anyone to feel that sense of loneliness I have.\"\n\nThe project, run by the National Autistic Society (NAS), aims to encourage adults living with autism to start their own peer support groups, where members can regularly meet for activities such as bowling, pizza or games nights. Research by the charity suggested 80% of adults living with autism experience feelings of loneliness and isolation. \"Some of the things that we get regularly are around not being confident with people who are used to being bullied or picked on,\" said Simon Humphreys, who started the first social club for people living with autism in Colwyn Bay. \"They don't like to mix and they feel very vulnerable. \"People just feel desperate and alone. At least this way we are talking and developing a friendship family.\"\n\nThose attending the friendship clubs say they can \"geek out\" without fear.\n\nLike Emma, former wrestler and hospice worker, Emrys Forrester also only found out he was living with autism in his mid-20s. He said attending Simon's group in Colwyn Bay had helped him to understand who he was. \"I've always felt like a socially awkward person,\" he said. \"As an adult, once you're diagnosed you get the paperwork and stuff but then you're off. That's it. \"This is great because it's able to get you interacting with other people with autism who have real experiences. If you understand what they go though it can help you too.\"\n\nEmyrs said he wouldn't normally feel comfortable going to a busy cafe\n\nFor Declan Boland, 29, it is an opportunity to talk for hours without fear of being judged. \"Talking is frightening for a lot of autistic people,\" he said. \"I have to mask a lot of what I do and concentrate, make sure I stick to a topic and don't go off on a tangent. \"Here you can just embrace the weirdness. You meet a range of people with different interests, but we always have that specialist subject, that we've absorbed like a sponge. \"When we get to geek out, honestly, it's the best thing in the world.\"\n\nDeclan loves to \"embrace the weirdness\" at his friendship group\n\nDeclan's special interest is cars, others at the Colwyn Bay club love talking for hours about gardening, films or even Thomas the Tank Engine - without fear of judgement. In Abergavenny, it is her love of time travel fiction that Emma dreams of sharing with potential new friends. Together with local councillor Kyle Elridge, who also lives with autism, Emma is starting the Abergavenny spectrum social. They have struck an agreement with a local caf\u00e9 to turn off the music and turn down the lights for their group when they meet once a month. If successful, it will be the eighth group in Wales, with hopes by NAS to roll the project out in England too \"It'll be super special and cosy,\" said Emma. \"I'm hoping I'll just grab a few drinks and talk about really weird stuff. \"None of that normal support group kind of stuff. It's going to be really fun and an opportunity for people to be themselves.\"\n\nFor more on this story, watch Wales Live on BBC iPlayer.",
    "Abusive ex banned partner from using the toilet\n\nGareth Jones says it has taken a long time to get his life back on track\n\nWarning: This article contains details of abuse some may find distressing\n\nA man who was kicked and punched, made to sleep on the floor and refused access to a toilet by his abusive ex-girlfriend says he wants to tell his story to help other victims. Gareth Jones, 41, said it took more than a year of therapy to begin to recover from months of emotional and physical abuse from a woman he met online in July 2021. A charity whose helpline he turned to said male domestic abuse was not as rare as some people may think - and one in six or seven men will be a victim in their lifetime. The Mankind Initiative, external also found one in 25 men would suffer at the hands of a partner in Wales every year.\n\nGareth Jones met Sarah Rigby on an online dating app in 2021\n\nEarlier this year, 41-year-old Sarah Rigby, from Winsford in Cheshire, was given a 20-month prison sentence, external suspended for two years, at Chester Crown Court, after pleading guilty to coercive and controlling behaviour. Det Con Sophie Ward of Cheshire Police described Rigby having a \"stranglehold\" over her victim, adding: \"Many people think that only women can be victims of controlling and coercive behaviour, but as this case demonstrates, that is not always the case.\" Mr Jones, an NHS manager originally from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, described being isolated from friends and family during their nine-month relationship, losing control of his finances and about \u00a340,000. He was subjected to daily verbal abuse and humiliation - not allowed to use the toilet in the house or shower without Rigby's permission. Strict controls on his diet meant he lost 4.5 stone (28kg) in two months, while Rigby repeatedly told him she would tell the police he had assaulted her if he spoke to anyone about the abuse.\n\nSpeaking five months after the sentencing, he said at first the relationship seemed \"normal\", though in hindsight he could see that she was \"overly affectionate\". \"I guess they call it love bombing,\" he said. \"I thought 'how can this person be so loving?'. \"I think it takes you aback... you think this could really be the one, and this could work out. He gave up his apartment and moved in to Rigby's home just four months after they met. It was then the abuse accelerated. Rigby made him pay for all the time he previously spent at the house. He also paid \u00a3700 a month in rent, plus all the bills, but was not allowed a key, and could only be in the property when she was home. Restrictions were also placed on his use of the bathroom, and what he could and could not eat.\n\nAs well as her suspended prison sentence, Rigby was handed a five-year restraining order and ordered to complete 35 days of rehabilitation\n\n\"She made me sleep on the floor with no covers if things weren't going her way, as a punishment,\" he said. \"I wasn't allowed to shower or shave, or use the toilet. \"I had to hold it in and try to make it down to the local supermarket or a pub or a restaurant. \"If she wanted to go out, I had to leave, even if I was trying to work.\" Rigby would go through his phone, and tell him not to associate with family and friends, telling him \"you are with me now\". Any texts he sent his mum, he would delete immediately to avoid repercussions. There was physical abuse, including biting, kicking, scratching and clawing. He described an occasion in London on a long weekend, when Rigby demanded he buy her a designer handbag. \"We were in Harrods and she said 'we're not leaving until you buy me something expensive',\" he said. \"She clawed me through my jumper, my arm was actually bleeding, until she forced me into buying something expensive for her.\" Five months after he moved in with Rigby, things came to a head when he met his mum in secret for a cup of coffee. \"She broke down in front of me,\" he said. \"I thought 'I can't put my family though it any longer'... they were imploring me to leave.\" Around that time, Gareth made a call to the Mankind Initiative. It confirmed he was suffering domestic violence - and hearing it from someone neutral helped him understand he needed to get out.\n\nOn a trip to London, Gareth was forced to buy expensive gifts for Rigby\n\nGareth's mum Diane Debens said the family was \"proud\" of him for speaking out. She said it put a huge strain on them, adding: \"You go through a gamut of emotions. \"There's frustration. You want to shake them and say 'just get out of this'. \"You know they are going through pain. It's your child, no matter what age. And you feel helpless, really.\" Ms Debens said they would see Gareth with bruises, which he would brush off, and on one occasion, a cut across his nose. \"I couldn't believe that one human being could treat another human being like this,\" she added.\n\nGareth's mum Diane Debens is proud of her son for speaking out about what happened to him\n\nMankind Initiative chairman Mark Brooks praised Gareth's bravery in telling his story, and said the experience of men like him was not often heard about. \"There isn't much about male victims of domestic abuse,\" he said. \"It's not often talked about. \"So there isn't always that awareness, even for men that domestic abuse actually does and can actually happen to them.\"\n\nBoth Gareth and his mum hope he will feel ready to find love in the future, but he said he was not there yet. Gareth left his abuser with \"only the clothes on my back\" and has had to start from scratch financially, make a new home, and build friendships back up - not to mention work he has had to put in rebuilding himself. \"It knocked my confidence for a long time... I had low self-esteem because of the constant abuse,\" he said. \"I had to go through therapy.\" He added there was a stigma around men talking about being abused - and wanted to tell his story to try and change that.

    "Scot gets dream job as lighthouse keeper on remote Australian island\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The Scot in charge of an Australian lighthouse\n\nA Scottish man has landed his \"dream job\" as a lighthouse keeper on a remote Australian island. Sandy Duthie, 42, jumped at the chance when the previous lighthouse keeper decided to retire after 25 years on Gabo Island, off the coast of Victoria. Sandy, from Aberdeenshire, visited Australia five years ago with his partner, and never left. When he went to the small lighthouse island he realised he would love to one day become part of its history. Landing the lighthouse keeper and island caretaker job means he is now spending six months of the year there - one month on and one month off - with a colony of penguins for company.\n\nSandy Duthie jumped at the chance when the lighthouse keeper job opened up\n\nSandy hails from Kirkton of Durris, near Banchory. He studied ecology at the University of Aberdeen before becoming an arborist. He visited Mallacoota in 2019 with his partner Brodie Gaudion on an initial three-month holiday visa to meet her family for the first time, and ended up staying. He first went to Gabo Island two years ago, and dreamed of eventually being its caretaker. Gabo lighthouse itself was built more than 160 years ago. Previous keeper Leo op den Brouw, 70, had spent every second month alone on the island for the past 25 years. When he decided to return to family life on the mainland earlier this year that left the post open, and Sandy landed the job with government organisation Parks Victoria.\n\nGabo lighthouse was built more than 160 years ago\n\nHe and another keeper - who has now been working there for 16 years - share the month-on and month-off rotation. Sandy and his enormous beard - which he has been cultivating for many years, and which he thinks may have helped in the job interview - started his new job back in March. He gets to and from the island via a small boat charter. It takes about 30 minutes if the weather allows it - the conditions are often choppy - and there tend to be whales nearby. Sandy's first experience of Gabo Island came when he visited for two weeks to do weed control work. \"It felt like home immediately, it felt very much like the north east of Scotland,\" he explained.\n\nGabo Island is Sandy's new home for half the year\n\n\"The foliage - it\u2019s pretty scrubby - and the granite is unlike any other part of Australia that I\u2019ve seen. I fell immediately in love with the place. \"I asked the caretaker then how he got he job and he told me it was just luck at the right place and the right time. And since then he retired and I applied for the job - right place, right time. \"The job does not come up very often.\" He described Gabo island as small but with \"amazing\" wildlife. \"We have little penguins - a large colony of them,\" he said. \"We have whales, sea eagles and seals. We have whales go past constantly at the moment. \"I saw around 15 or 16 today. Sometimes there are 30 or 40 a day.\"\n\nSandy with the lighthouse shining in the dark outside\n\nSandy said the job itself is more like a way of living. \"You have to really get with the rhythm of what you have to do and not put too much expectation or planning because Gabo Island has a way of flipping round whatever plans you have. \"You have to be able to problem-solve. Our range of tasks run from weather observations every six hours to cleaning the public toilets, painting everything - we have 80% humidity with salt air so everything rusts and corrodes and it all needs looked after. \"There\u2019s a lot of ongoing maintenance that needs to be done to the house. \"You just have to expect the unexpected.\"\n\nHe said the job was ideal for him, but that it came with challenges. \"There\u2019s enough difference to keep your mind busy all the time,\" Sandy said. \"I quite enjoy my own company. I do also enjoy the company of others. My partner comes to visit. \"Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some days where it seems like a prison sometimes. \"The previous caretaker described it as Alcatraz the rock. You can\u2019t leave, go to family events if you\u2019re here. Sometimes we get stuck on here for days on end because of the weather. \"But at the same time you can basically write your own script of the day and go about your duties. \u201cIt can be difficult when phone signal drops out but there\u2019s not much that I miss.. He said supplies could run low if a boat did not come. \"But the other side of it is when I get back to the mainland, something I\u2019ve found is having to be super cautious about being in a crowd of people. \"If you\u2019ve been here for weeks by yourself and not seen another face it\u2019s quite intimidating going to the pub or going to an event.\u201d\n\nSandy believes he was just in the right place at the right time\n\nHe has also discovered that there were other Scottish connections to Gabo Island. \"The pink granite on Gabo is very hard compared to other Australian granite,\" Sandy explained. \"Documents I\u2019ve found suggest the person in charge of building the lighthouse in 1859 actually sought Scottish stonemasons, in particular ones who had worked on the Aberdeen and Peterhead lighthouses, as they were used to working with such a hard material. \"Unfortunately we don\u2019t know much more about who built the lighthouse though. \"There\u2019s a book about all of the caretakers who have been on the island since 1859, and a lot of them are Scottish - people from the Highlands and Islands, Perth, Edinburgh, Glasgow and from the north east too. \"It\u2019s really incredible the Scottish connection here. \u201cIt is 100% a dream job. For me it\u2019s perfect.\"",
    "Alma's Not Normal: How anger and spa breaks fuelled new series\n\nSophie Willan has already picked up two Baftas for Alma's Not Normal\n\nRed hair. Pink fur coat. White helmet. Green tartan trousers. Huffing and puffing uphill on a rickety old bike towards the job centre. Not quite as graceful as ET on two wheels but that first scene introducing the titular character in Sophie Willan's sitcom Alma's Not Normal created an instant connection with a new audience. It's over four years since Willan's semi-autobiographical debut series lifted us during the lockdown gloom. Now the irrepressible Alma (Willan), an aspiring working-class actress from Bolton whose mum Lin (Siobhan Finneran) is struggling with heroin addiction and mental health issues, is back. For the uninitiated, the premise may sound bleak, but not a bit of it. Pathos might never be far away but humour is always at the forefront. Having tried her hand as both an escort and a sandwich \"artiste\" at SubNGo in series one, Alma and her best friend Leanne (Jayde Adams) are on the hunt for jobs, fun and sex in the highly anticipated second series. But this time, cancer also looms large as Alma's grandma Joan (Lorraine Ashbourne) receives a diagnosis.\n\nLin (Siobhan Finneran) is incredibly fragile (and funny) but is struggling to navigate the healthcare system\n\nMany aspects of Alma's life reflect the real-life experiences of Willan, who was brought up by her grandmother Denise, between stints in foster care. Willan later turned to sex work to make ends meet, but prior to that, she had caught the acting bug while on holiday with Denise in Ibiza at a hotel drama club. She joined a theatre company in Manchester and set about forming her own, before landing the Caroline Aherne bursary in 2017, which develops new comedy talent. And Alma was born. Denise died of cancer while Willan was filming the first series of Alma and she dedicated her second Bafta win in 2022 to her zebra print-loving gran., external \"The second series was very hard to write, because some of it was stuff that I was currently dealing with rather than stuff that I processed long ago,\" Willan tells the BBC. \"I suppose what's always helped me is finding the political. As soon as it feels political or [it's] a cultural, social problem, then I get dead angry and that\u2019s why the comedy's great because it's anger. And love.\" Her main bugbears are \"the mental health system and the care system and all of the cuts to it. \"I wanted to take the state to task. I wanted to show the impact on vulnerable women. \"And what happens to my mum in [the show] is systematic failure. And then also cancer on a more personal [level]... everyone experiences it and we don't know how to talk about that.\" She explains: \"Even though we all seem quite narcissistic in writing, actually you can't just write about yourself, it has to feel like it's about something bigger than you.\" She jokes that procrastination is often her biggest enemy. \"I lived in a spa for a year!\" she giggles. \"It wasn\u2019t even conscious, I\u2019d just go around the country, avoiding [writing]. \"Which is why you need to pay working class people well.. I get Ubers now!\" Her self-care also includes Merlot, she laughs.\n\nLorraine Ashbourne's character Joan (left) is the lynchpin of the family\n\nSiobhan Finneran, known for roles in hit series such as Downton Abbey, Happy Valley and Benidorm, plays Alma's mum, an often desperate but funny, angry and tenacious woman who is stuck in the healthcare system's revolving door as she tries to come off heroin. \"I love the fact that she's got no edit button,\" Finneran says of Lin. \"And the only people I know who are allowed to get away with that are toddlers or... [people] over 80. They sort of lose the ability to edit. And I love that about her because it's very raw and it's very honest.\" Ashbourne is also in thrall to her character, who has a tough exterior but a lust for life - and leopard print. \"I wish I was a little bit like Joan. I invited somebody to see the Manchester screening [of the first two episodes of series two]. She had had cancer, and she said, 'Lorraine, why didn't you tell me it was about cancer?' \"And I kind of thought, well, it is about cancer. Of course it is. But it's sort of almost more important that it's about Joan's spirit... and the way she tackles it and fights it.\"\n\nLeanne is branching out with a pop-up bar in Bolton and, as usual, is dressed to kill - Willan says \"costume was just as important and was actually written into the script on some occasions.\"\n\nBut while Joan and Lin are a familial force to be reckoned with, Alma's relationship with her bestie Leanne is arguably the show's cornerstone. Willan and Adams first met doing cabaret in 2015. \"The first time Sophie saw me, I was singing Time to Say Goodbye in an Asda uniform,\" laughs Adams, who took part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2022. \"And she saw me in a way no-one else in the industry has seen me. Sophie and I are genuine bezzies. And the number of times we've been on the Veuve Clicquot... because we're fancy now. Working class people are allowed to have standards!\" Leanne is confident, optimistic and a grafter. A force to be reckoned with. \"Sophie wrote Leanne with me in mind,\" Adams explains. \"She\u2019s like how I hope people see me, but so often in my personal life, when you're working class, you don't react to things the way middle class people do. So when I get the word 'no' I\u2019m like, 'Well, why not?' \"My career went crazy, which is absolutely brilliant but it\u2019s also mental. And in that period of time, I had the strength in this person that she'd written for me. \"And to be able to be seen by at least one person in this industry in the way that I actually am, rather than the way that people perceive me, because... I'm nearly six foot [tall] and I'm nearly six foot wide. \"I can't be apologetic because I look like an apologetic giraffe! It\u2019s just given me real strength and stability.\" Playwright and screenwriter James Graham recently called for more opportunities for working-class people in the TV industry. Delivering the MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival in August, he cited figures which suggest only 8% of people currently working in television are from a working-class background. Graham, who wrote the play Dear England and TV's Sherwood, referred to class as \"everyone\u2019s least favourite diversity and representation category\" and said more attention should be paid to social mobility. Ashbourne tells Willan: \"I don't think there's anything on TV quite like it. I think you're a brilliant role model for people that come from challenging or diverse backgrounds. And you don't settle for \u2018no\u2019. You want the best and you are deserving of the best.\" Alma's Not Normal will be shown on BBC Two (at 22:00 BST) and on iPlayer from Monday 7 October.",
    "The march in central London started on Sunday morning at the Albert Embankment and was followed by a rally in Parliament Square\n\nThousands of people gathered in central London on Sunday to call for tougher action on keeping the UK's rivers and seas clean. The March for Clean Water was advertised as a \"one-off\" event to petition the government to enforce laws that tackle water pollution and ensure \"all polluting industries\" upgrade infrastructure and reduce water wastage. According to the Environment Agency, there were 3.6 million hours of spills in 2023 - more than double the total hours of spills in 2022. Steve Reed, the environment, food, and rural affairs secretary, said he shared the \"public's anger\" and had taken \"immediate action\" to start tackling the \"pollution scandal\"\n\nA spokesperson for the water industry regulator Ofwat said \"companies will be held to account for past failings\" and it had opened an enforcement action against \"all wastewater companies\". Water companies can release untreated sewage when it rains heavily to prevent homes being flooded but there have been instances where this has been done prematurely, and such spills are potentially illegal when it is dry. Contained within the spills is human waste, wet wipes and sanitary products, which can pose a serious risk to the local wildlife, swimmers and others who use UK waterways. On average in 2023, there were 1,271 spills a day across England, compared to 825 in 2022. The Clean Water March was organised by 140 organisations and started at the Albert Embankment and ended with a rally in Parliament Square. Those taking part came from across the UK, from West Yorkshire to Pembrokeshire, and the organisers said 8,000 people registered to take part.\n\nSarah Walsh said she was awake at 02:00 GMT to get a coach to London for the march\n\nSarah Walsh from Cornwall was at the march and told the BBC that pollution in the sea \"affects my livelihood directly\" as an open-water swimming coach. \"I can\u2019t take people swimming if the sea\u2019s got any form of pollution in it,\" she said. \"It affects our well-being as well because we can\u2019t get in the sea, so it\u2019s just been horrendous this year particularly.\u201d Katherine Keyte from Poole and Bournemouth is part of a cold water swim group and said she had \"never marched before\" but \"felt very, very passionately about this\". \u201cThe frustration is around everything, I don\u2019t really care who is in government, it is about having a plan, a plan that lasts more than four years, a plan that is long term so we can all enjoy, so our children, and our children\u2019s children can enjoy clean water,\" the 60-year-old said. She added: \u201cIt is quite emotional looking and seeing the amount and type of people from every walk of life and every hobby \u2013 and they have all come down for one cause.\u201d\n\nChris Packham said people want to see \"more action rapidly\" from the government on water pollution\n\nNature broadcaster Chris Packham was among the crowd at the march in central London and said \"people are still frustrated\" and want to see action more rapidly. He criticised the Budget that was announced on Wednesday for \"not mentioning nature\", which he called \"reckless\". \"I think this is very much a time when we want to see our politicians putting planet first and understanding that this is a long-term investment that\u2019s required to recover these ecosystems and it needs to go in place now,\" he told the BBC.\n\nSteve Reed said within 70 days of winning the general election in July, he introduced new laws banning the payment of \"unfair bonuses to polluting water bosses\". He added that he had launched a commission to lead a \"root and branch review of the entire water sector to put right what's gone so badly wrong\". A spokesperson from Water UK, the trade association for the water industry, said it supported the aims of March for Clean Water, adding that the system was \"not working\" and was \"not delivering for people or the environment\". \u201cNo sewage spill is ever acceptable, and water companies want to invest a record \u00a3108 billion to ensure the security of our water supply in the future and end sewage entering our rivers and seas.\"",

    "Sinn F\u00e9in knew of McMonagle references last year, says charity\n\nMichael McMonagle pleaded guilty in September to a series of child sex offences\n\nA senior Sinn F\u00e9in official knew last year that two of the party's press officers provided references for a former colleague who was being investigated for child sex offences, a charity has said. Michael McMonagle was employed by the British Heart Foundation in September 2022 after neither reference raised concerns about his suitability for employment. He later admitted the offences. Michelle O'Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in's vice-president and Northern Ireland's first minister, confirmed a human resources (HR) manager had been contacted by the charity in August 2023, but added the party's leadership had not been made aware of this.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, she described this as \"a serious omission\". Previously, Sinn F\u00e9in minister Conor Murphy told BBC News NI the party had only been aware of the references since 25 September 2024. Last month, McMonagle, of Limewood Street in Londonderry, admitted a series of child sex offences. O'Neill said she apologised for the hurt and distress caused by the press officers who provided the references.\n\nShe also reiterated Murphy's claim that the party leadership was unaware of the references until recently. \u201cOn Wednesday 25 September 2024, Sinn F\u00e9in and I were informed that two press officers, who were former colleagues of Michael McMonagle, had provided employment references for him,\" O'Neill said in a statement. \"I am absolutely appalled and horrified that this occurred,\" she continued. \"These references were given without the knowledge or authorisation of the party. \"Under no circumstances would the party provide a reference, for work or otherwise, for Michael McMonagle.\" O'Neill also said she apologised \"for the hurt and distress caused by their actions\". On Saturday afternoon, Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson said it was time for \"full transparency\", and called for the first minister to make a statement in the Assembly and take questions. \"Is the truth being hid or is there a total lack of competence,\" he questioned. \"It's time for honesty. \"With every new revelation undermining a previous Sinn F\u00e9in position, this issue requires deeper scrutiny.\" He also said the issue should be examined by the Assembly's executive office committee.\n\nMichelle O\u2019Neill this morning reiterated her anger and disgust that two former press officers at Stormont had provided references to Michael McMonagle.\n\nThe work references were provided three months after McMonagle was dismissed from the party while under police investigation. Sinn F\u00e9in said this happened without clearance from the party and described the press officers' actions as wrong and unacceptable. O\u2019Neill said \"decisive action\" was taken to ensure that both individuals \"were held accountable for their unacceptable actions\". In a statement, the head of the British Heart Foundation, Fearghal McKinney, said O'Neill had \"expressed regret\" about questioning the charity's due diligence. Earlier this week, O'Neill said there were lessons for a lot of people in terms of \"due diligence for an employer when they take on an employee\u201d. She has previously denied knowing that McMonagle had taken up a new job with the charity, despite the pair attending the same event to support organ donation at Stormont in 2023. The pair spoke by phone on Saturday. \u201cMichelle O\u2019Neill agreed recent comments by her and party colleagues questioning the BHF\u2019s due diligence process were unhelpful, and she expressed regret for the damage and upset this has caused to our dedicated staff and supporters,\" he said. A spokesperson from the British Heart Foundation added it has \"robust recruitment and safeguarding processes\".\n\nMcMonagle had worked for Sinn F\u00e9in for about seven years, first as a policy advisor at Stormont and later as a press officer in the north west until his arrest in 2021, after which his employment with the party ended. He was then employed by the British Heart Foundation charity a year later, having received references from two other former Sinn F\u00e9in press officers. The references, provided by Se\u00e1n Mag Uidhir and Caol\u00e1n McGinley, raised no \"concern about his suitability for employment or referenced an ongoing police investigation or suspension from his previous employment\", according to the charity. Se\u00e1n Mag Uidhir and Caol\u00e1n McGinley later resigned after it emerged that they had provided the references without clearance from the party, who condemned their actions. In September, McMonagle, of Limewood Street in Londonderry, admitted a series of child sex offences. The offences relate to various dates between May 2020 and August 2021, and include charges of attempting to incite two children to engage in sexual activity.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the charity said it was \u201cmade aware of the arrest of and subsequent criminal charges against the individual by a media query on Saturday 29th July 2023 and we suspended him as soon as possible on Monday 31st July 2023\u201d. It added that it \"reviewed the recruitment process for the individual\". As part of that review, it continued, \"on 3 August 2023 we had email dialogue with a senior Sinn F\u00e9in HR official where we shared that we had two references from Sinn F\u00e9in\". It stated that it is therefore \"confident that it fully complied with its policy in relation to obtaining reference checks\".\n\nGavin Robinson says Michelle O'Neill should answer questions on McMonagle in the Assembly\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI earlier this week, Sinn F\u00e9in Minister Conor Murphy said the party did not warn the British Heart Foundation as it could \u201cpotentially be prejudicial\u201d to the police investigation. A few days later, PSNI chief constable Jon Boutcher contradicted Murphy\u2019s claims and said that he did not see how it would have prejudiced the case. He added that he did not want the PSNI to get involved in a political \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d. On Friday, Alliance leader Naomi Long said that Sinn F\u00e9in should consider whether it\u2019s actions were \u201cappropriate\u201d. In her statement on Saturday, Michelle O'Neill added \"for the purpose of completeness\", that she had also been made aware by staff of an \"unrelated issue with an adult female colleague of Michael McMonagle at a non-work related social gathering a number of years ago\". \"This was in no way related to any child protection issue and related to him making the female colleague feel uncomfortable,\" she continued. \"This was resolved by mutual agreement between them at the time.\u201d",
    "Ariana Grande (right) plays Glinda, who forms a friendship with Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba\n\nAriana Grande has told the BBC that she channelled her personal feelings of loss when filming Wicked. \"Losing someone you love is something we've all unfortunately had to experience - and sometimes we have the privilege to say goodbye and sometimes we don't,\" she says. Grande, 31, plays Galinda Upland in the film, which is an adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical exploring the Wizard of Oz universe from the perspective of two witches. The two-time Grammy award winner has suffered personal tragedy in recent years, after the 2017 Manchester bombing of her concert and the death of her former partner Mac Miller a year later.\n\nShe says appearing in Wicked, one of the first Broadway shows she saw as a child, \"feels like a homecoming\". \"This music has always brought such comfort and now being able to spend time with it and be trusted with it is the privilege of a lifetime.\" In the weeks running up to the film's release, the close relationship between Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo has been in the spotlight. \"From the moment we were cast, Cynthia invited me over and we hung out for five hours and we laughed and we cried and got to know each other. \"We had a real conversation right off the bat about creating a safe space for each other and being honest with each other,\" she says. Grande and Erivo's characters begin in the Oz universe as university students, before later becoming enemies as Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West. Erivo, 37, has described her role as \"a real honour\" and nods to the foundations formed by the original stage actors Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, who she calls \"the architects\". \"We've been handed something really special and it's a dream come true and truly big shoes to fill,\" she adds.\n\nCritics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised, external the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\". There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara,, external who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\". However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked, external as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films. The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded, external three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\". \"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added. But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded, external: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"\n\nGrammy Award-winning Grande plays Galinda Upland, who goes on to become Glinda the Good Witch\n\nErivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple. She says she was able to draw on her own experiences of struggling with acceptance for the role of Elphaba, who is outcast for her green exterior. \"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says. Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera. Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.\n\nIts reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat. Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero. Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\". Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\". He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness. \"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"\n\nJeff Goldblum plays The Wizard of Oz and Michelle Yeoh plays Madame Morrible in Wicked\n\nThe musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever. \"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says. Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time. He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters. \"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds. \"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that. \"We were all going through stuff in our own lives and I think they were generous to offer that up within the roles of Glinda, Elphaba and the Wizard.\"",
    "Most of Thunderbirds was filmed on the Slough Trading Estate\n\nFilm cans containing unseen footage of the Thunderbirds TV show have been found in a garden shed. A family found the cans - light-tight containers used to enclose film - in a Buckinghamshire shed belonging to their father, who was an editor on the show and died recently. Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re, from Century 21 Films which received the 22 old cans, said they mainly contained Thunderbirds material from the 1960s, including an alternative version of an episode that was never broadcast. It is hoped the footage - filmed on the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire - can be shown to the public as part of the series' 60th anniversary next year.\n\nThe film cans were found in a garden shed\n\nMr La Rivi\u00e8re said he was contacted by the family last year. He said they were difficult to identify because of their condition but \"clearly the majority of it was Thunderbirds\". The only way to get a proper look at the material was to transfer it to digital, and so began the \"very, very slow\" process of scanning it. \"It took weeks, bit-by-bit,\" said Mr La Rivi\u00e8re. \"Every night I'd get a link for a download of the latest one that had been scanned... you'd never know what you'd get.\"\n\nThe film can had been damaged, exposing it to the elements\n\nA lot of the material was the same as what had been aired. \"Eventually, listening one night... this one played out and it was not the same as broadcast,\" Mr La Rivi\u00e8re said. He said it turned out to be an alternative edit of an existing episode which had a previously unseen scene. Mr La Rivi\u00e8re said the film can was damaged, exposing the contents to the elements, so there was some restoration work to do on the material first. But then he hoped it could be shown to the public in 2025, after 60 years of \"lying around waiting to be discovered\".\n\nDo you have a story BBC Berkshire should cover?\n\u2022 None Thunderbirds are go... again.

    "Flynn aims to stand for SNP at Holyrood election\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn explains why he wants to stand as an MSP\n\nSNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn intends to stand at the 2026 Holyrood elections, he has announced. The Aberdeen South MP said if elected to the Scottish Parliament he would aim to hold his Westminster seat until the next general election, due in 2029, but would not accept two salaries. The announcement has prompted concerns among party colleagues, with one MSP urging him to rethink his decision. Applications to stand as an SNP candidate in 2026 closed on Monday, though the formal selection process will not start until next year.\n\nBBC Scotland News understands that former first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf have submitted applications, but are both yet to decide on whether to stand for re-election.\n\nHumza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon are yet to confirm whether they will stand for another term at Holyrood\n\nFlynn, writing in the Press and Journal, said he hoped to win his party's nomination for the Aberdeen South and North Kincardine seat, currently held by Audrey Nicoll. The SNP Westminster leader told BBC Scotland News: \"As we make this journey to independence, I believe that we need our strongest voices within Holyrood all pulling in the same direction. I believe that I can contribute as part of that process.\u201d Flynn said he took \"no pleasure\" from potentially competing with Nicoll for selection. \"We are a democratic party, this does happen on occasion,\" he said. \u201cIt will now be for members to decide the outcome.\u201d The MP insisted the dual role would offer him a \u201cplatform to speak up for Scotland's interest\u201d, both at Holyrood and Westminster. \u201cAnd I think that's a good thing,\u201d he added. Flynn has been tipped as a future SNP leader, but he predicted there would not be a contest to replace John Swinney for \u201clong, long time\u201d, adding that he had full confidence in the first minister. He told BBC Scotland News: \"I just want to be part of his team.\u201d Nicoll, who was first elected to parliament at the 2021 election, said the process was still at an early stage and Flynn was within his rights to stand for selection. She confirmed that she had submitted her forms for selection as well. \"We had a conversation so I did know he was intending on putting his name forward,\" she said. \"I love this role and it\u2019s very important to me. It\u2019s filled with responsibility and I look forward to continuing it if I can.\"\n\nAhead of the 2021 election, the SNP changed internal rules to require MPs to resign their seat at Westminster to fight for selection to Holyrood. The party previously criticised former Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross for holding seats at Westminster and Holyrood, as well as being a professional football referee. In 2021, SNP MSP Karen Adam claimed Ross was \u201cfailing\u201d his constituents \u201cby thinking he can do both jobs properly\u201d. Speaking at the SNP conference in August, external, Flynn joked about Ross having \"one too many work commitments\". Announcing his intention to stand in the Holyrood election, Flynn told the Press and Journal he believed the party's selection rules were \"election-specific\". He pointed to examples of SNP politicians who have held seats in both parliaments before, citing First Minister John Swinney and ex-First Minister Alex Salmond.\n\nSNP MSP Emma Roddick has urged Stephen Flynn not to seek a dual mandate\n\nSNP MSP Emma Roddick said she hoped Flynn \"rethinks\" his ambition to hold two seats seats. She posted on X:, external \u201cParty members set this rule for good reasons. Rightly, Douglas Ross was criticised for holding two roles simultaneously.\" The Highlands and Islands representative said she could not imagine \"being a good MSP\" while spending \"half\" her time in London. She added: \"(It is) Key that rules apply to everyone equally; men and women.\" One former SNP MP told BBC Scotland News: \"I'm not sure being seen to do Audrey Nicoll out of her job so that he can have two jobs is a smart pitch.\" Another senior party figure described Flynn's move as \"naked ambition\". Dozens of MSPs have had a dual mandate, either as a member of the House of Lords, the House of Commons or as a councillor - including 20 this term, external. Roddick, who was elected to Holyrood in 2021, held a dual mandate for a year while also serving as an Inverness councillor.\n\nStephen Flynn says he believes John Swinney will remain as SNP leader for \"many years\"\n\nThe SNP is yet to decide what its rules will be for candidates at the next election. The change on dual mandates led to then-MP Joanna Cherry pulling out of the selection contest for the Edinburgh Central seat. Health Secretary Neil Gray also had to resign as an MP before being elected to Holyrood in 2021. Cherry - who lost her Westminster seat in July\u2019s general election and has ruled out a bid for election to Holyrood in 2026 - said the SNP rule was \u201cperson specific\u201d. Responding to Flynn\u2019s announcement, she added in a post on X that the rule, external \u201cserved its purpose\u201d and predicted it would not be in place for 2026. The Scottish government recently said, external it intended to launch a consultation on proposals to ban MSPs from holding dual mandates, though any changes are not expected to be introduced in time for the 2026 election.\n\nConservative MSP Liam Kerr highlighted the SNP's previous opposition to dual mandates, adding: \u201cAnd now, when it suits Stephen Flynn, and it seems to suit the SNP, they decide that it\u2019s all perfectly acceptable in their world.\u201d Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also accused the SNP of hypocrisy. He noted the party\u2019s previous opposition to \u201cdouble jobbing\u201d, adding: \u201cBut it seems it\u2019s OK when an SNP politician wants to do it.\u201d\n\nFew who follow Scottish politics will be surprised by Stephen Flynn\u2019s decision. He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the SNP\u2019s most talented politicians. And Holyrood offers opportunities for him that Westminster never will (such as being a government minister or - one day perhaps - first minister). But this is a controversial move in a number of ways. Even though other SNP politicians have sat previously at Westminster and Holyrood simultaneously, party rhetoric on \"double jobbing\" has hardened in recent years. The party previously claimed former Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross was trying to \"have his cake and eat it\" by sitting in both parliaments. Flynn will now face the same accusation. Secondly, there\u2019s already a sitting SNP MSP in the seat where Stephen Flynn aims to be a candidate. And she has not indicated that she plans to stand down. So it looks like an internal challenge is on. To sum it up, this is an expected move with some unexpected elements.\n\nFormer SNP MP Richard Thomson, who lost his seat in Gordon in July, has also confirmed he is seeking election to Holyrood in 2026. He has not specified a constituency, though he posted on X, external that there was \u201cimportant work to be done for the north east and Scotland as a whole\u201d. While being selected to stand in a constituency is one potential route to the Scottish Parliament, candidates can also win a seat via regional lists under the Holyrood voting system.",
    "Ex-Met Police officer David Carrick will appear in court on 17 October after being charged with eight sexual offences\n\nA former Met Police officer has been charged with eight sexual offences against two women. David Carrick from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has been charged with five counts of indecent assault, two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Hertfordshire Constabulary has also charged him with one count of coercive and controlling behaviour. The 49-year-old will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 17 October.\n\nMr Carrick previously served with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command within the Metropolitan Police.\n\nDet Ch Insp Iain Moor, from Hertfordshire Constabulary's major crime unit, led the investigation.

    "First sighting of Belarusian political prisoner in more than 600 days\n\n\"I cannot believe it!\" wrote Maria Kolesnikova's sister on X\n\nAfter more than 600 days of denied visits, calls and correspondence, the jailed Belarusian opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova has been allowed to see her father in prison. A photo, published on social media, shows the activist in what appears to be a prison housecoat hugging her father. On her face is the smile she became famous for as one of the leaders of a wave of giant protests in 2020 that put the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko under unprecedented pressure. It survived by responding with mass arrests, police beatings and torture - all thoroughly documented, but still flatly denied by officials.\n\nA peaceful protester, Maria Kolesnikova was sentenced to 11 years for extremism and supposedly plotting to overthrow the government. In September, her sister, Tatsiana, told the BBC that she was worried the Belarusian regime was \"killing Maria slowly\" in jail, where she had been kept in punishing conditions since March 2023, and was not allowed any contact with relatives or lawyers. Tatsiana called then for more international pressure to secure her sister's release, and the freedom of the many other political prisoners in Belarus. Now, she has posted the new prison photo on X with the line: \"I cannot believe it!\" The family have not yet shared any information about her health. In an odd twist the photo was first published on Telegram by the former opposition journalist Roman Protasevich, who was arrested when his Ryanair flight over Belarus was forcibly grounded. He now cooperates with the authorities, after a presidential pardon and early release. Mr Protasevich has given no details about the picture of Maria and her father, or the circumstances. Alexander Lukashenko, in power since the early 1990s, has called another presidential election in January in which no genuine opposition candidates will be allowed to take part. Recently, perhaps hoping to improve his image, he began pardoning small groups of prisoners. More than 70 have been set free since summer, including people jailed for participating in the 2020 protests, but most were close to the end of their sentence or sick. An announcement last week stated that another group jailed for \"extremism\" would be pardoned. It promised \"big news\", and said two women were on the list. But Tatsiana told the BBC that she did not believe the sudden reappearance of her sister for a prison visit meant she was about to be set free.\n\nMaria Kolesnikova, shown here in 2020, rallied crowds in nationwide protests after Lukashenko claimed yet another landslide election win\n\nSvetlana Tikhanovskaya, now in exile after running for election against Lukashenko, sent a short video on Telegram with greetings for \"Masha\", as she called Maria affectionately, and expressed \"joy\" to see her reunited with her father. \"How happy I am to see the smile that captivated us in 2020 and stays the same despite all you've been through,\" Tikhanovskaya said. Writing on X she added: \"Now, we must keep up the pressure to break the isolation of other political prisoners & free them all!\" Tikhanovskaya's husband, Sergei, is one of those still in prison and has also been kept incommunicado for many months, as have other political prisoners including Viktor Babaryko - another would-be presidential candidate locked up in 2020. Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Tikhanovskaya, told the BBC that Lukashenko's gesture to Maria was tokenism. \"Lukashenko is afraid right now to make any big moves and changes before his sham election - his self-reappointment. Just showing Maria doesn't threaten him, but he wants to show it as a big gesture of humanity - which it's not of course,\" Mr Viacorka believes. He put the gesture down to a recent increase in international attention and pressure. Lukashenko has been an international pariah for many years, with the European Union condemning the 2020 election results as \"falsified\". As for others still held, Mr Viacorka said: \"I dream of the moment my friends and colleagues are released. But I am a realist.\"",
    "Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu is trying to sway US election\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'I don't know - Biden on whether Netanyahu is attempting to sway election\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said he is unsure whether Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding off on agreeing a Gaza ceasefire deal in order to influence next month's US election. He was asked the question during a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters: \"Whether he\u2019s trying to influence the election, I don\u2019t know - but I\u2019m not counting on that.\u201d Biden then directed some terse words at his longtime ally: \u201cNo administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,\" he said. \"And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that.\" Some Democrats have voiced concern that Netanyahu is ignoring the US president's calls to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal in order to harm the party's chances in November.\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel\u2019s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s actions, as connected to the American election.\" Polls suggest the escalating violence in the Middle East and the failure to secure a diplomatic agreement is hurting Biden and his replacement as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. The president's approval rating among Arab-Americans has plummeted over the past year, largely due to anger at US support for Israel\u2019s military campaign, and this could damage the party's prospects in November. Biden has been pushing for a diplomatic agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, and has indicated several times that one is close. A deal before the election would be a major boost for the president and the Democratic Party but appears increasingly unlikely.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has mostly criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has rejected suggestions from Washington that an agreement is close. \"Hamas is not there with a deal. There\u2019s not a deal in the making, unfortunately,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said earlier this month just hours after a US official said it was 90% complete. The increasingly fractious relationship between Biden and Netanyahu, who have known one another for decades, contrasts with the friendly relationship the Israeli leader had with former president Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Israel, meanwhile, has continued strikes on Gaza and pushed ahead with a ground invasion in southern Lebanon. It has also vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack this week. At his appearance at Friday's press briefing, which came as a shock to reporters in the room as it was his first since becoming president four years ago, Biden responded to concern that Israel could strike Iranian oil fields in retaliation. \"The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike,\" he said. \"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.\" Biden caused oil prices to rise on Thursday when he said the US was discussing with Israel the possibility of strikes on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure.",
    "World number one Luke Humphries retained the Players Championship title with an 11-7 win over teenager Luke Littler in Minehead. Humphries, who beat Littler to win the world title in January, averaged 103.69 and punched the air with delight as he came out on top again. The 29-year-old, who has also won the World Matchplay this year, is only the second player after Michael van Gerwen to defend the Players title. It was a third big final involving the pair after Littler beat Humphries to land the Premier League in May. Littler was seeking his 11th title in an extraordinary debut season as a professional and second major TV ranking triumph this month after claiming the Grand Slam trophy a week ago. Backed by a boisterous crowd, the 17-year-old was fancied to get the better of Humphries, who had not looked at quite his brilliant best during the tournament in Somerset but stepped up a level in the final. \"I'm really proud of that one because I didn't feel myself this week playing-wise,\" said Humphries, who repeatedly lifted the trophy to the crowd as confetti rained down on him. \"There's something Luke does to you, he really drives me and makes me want to be a better player. I enjoy playing him.\" Humphries had to recover from 6-2 down to beat Dirk van Duijvenbode 11-8 in the semi-finals after earlier seeing off Ryan Joyce 10-5. \"I was very fortunate against Dirk but I rode my luck, got into the final and I was in my comfort zone,\" he added. \"These big games are what I live for, what I dream of, being a major champion is what I do it all for. \"If you go by stats Luke is easily the best player in the world, but there's something about me that never gives up. \"He's made me a bit hungrier, to practice more, to try a bit harder because if no-one sticks with him, he's going to win everything. I do believe we are the two best players in the world.\"\n\nThe match was played in a warm spirit with Humphries congratulating Littler after big checkouts\n\nHumphries opened up a 5-1 lead in a scrappy start to the final before Littler burst into life. A double double 20 finish and checkouts of 170 and 164 reduced the deficit to one, but the defending champion kept his composure - despite pulling away from the oche at one stage after wistling from the crowd - to seal victory. \"It was tough, I missed a few doubles,\" said Littler. \"If you don't take chances early on, it takes a lot to come back. I didn't have enough in the end.\" He hit three bull finishes as he beat World Grand Prix champion Mike de Decker 10-3 earlier on Sunday, before edging out Ross Smith 11-9 in a topsy-turvy last-four encounter. Humphries pocketed \u00a3120,000 for his tournament victory, while Littler \u2013 who has now won more than \u00a31m in prize money this year \u2013 collected \u00a360,000, taking his earnings to \u00a3618,500 for the Order of Merit, which is calculated over a two-year period. He has picked up \u00a3395,000 in winning the Premier League of Darts and World Series finals but, as those are invitational events, they do not count towards the rankings. Littler still goes into Monday's draw (16:30 GMT) as the bookmakers' favourite for the world championship, which starts on 15 December. A year ago he was ranked 164 and won the PDC world youth title on the Minehead stage with victory over Gian van Veen.

    "Chris Kaba shot man in nightclub days before his death\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. In this footage released by the CPS Chris Kaba (blue arrow) is seen in a nightclub with a gun (pink circle)\n\nChris Kaba, the man shot dead by a police firearms officer in south London, was named as the gunman in a nightclub shooting days before he died, it can now be reported. Mr Kaba was shot in the head during an armed vehicle stop in Streatham on 5 September 2022. It can now be reported that he shot a man in both legs at the Oval Space nightclub in Tower Hamlets, east London, on 30 August 2022. He was a rapper who performed under the names Madix or Mad Itch and was part of the 67 gang, a UK drill group and infamous gang.\n\nThe jury in the murder trial of firearms officer Martyn Blake, 40, was not told about Mr Kaba\u2019s criminal history. Mr Blake was cleared of murder by the jury at the Old Bailey on Monday, a verdict Mr Kaba\u2019s family said was \"painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system\". The judge has now lifted reporting restrictions in place during the trial on details about Mr Kaba\u2019s background.\n\nChris Kaba was unarmed when he was shot and killed in south London in 2022\n\nPolice officers did not know who was driving the Audi on the night Mr Kaba died, but they did know it had been used as a getaway car in another shooting in Brixton, south London, the night before. An automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) marker had been placed on the car, which alerted the police to it. Mr Blake denied intending to kill the 24-year-old - who was not carrying a firearm - and told the trial he believed one of his colleagues could be killed by Mr Kaba\u2019s car as he tried to get away from the police stop.\n\nThree other men have already been convicted over their involvement in the Hackney nightclub shooting and are in prison. During their trial, Mr Kaba was named by the judge as the gunman. The judge said Mr Kaba shot the man once in the leg while on the nightclub dance floor, and once outside as the man tried to escape. Mr Kaba died before being charged in connection with the shooting, but was later named on the charge sheet for the trial. In April the three defendants were sentenced to 10 years, nine years, and five years and six months respectively. During the trial of the firearms officer Mr Blake, reporting restrictions also prevented the media from publishing details of Mr Kaba\u2019s other criminal involvement - including previous convictions dating back to his early teen years. Those include convictions for affray and having an imitation firearm.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSenior Metropolitan Police officer Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy backed the release of Mr Kaba's gang links. In a court statement submitted before the judge's ruling that lifted reporting restrictions on Mr Kaba's background, Mr Cundy said that there would be less support for \"anti-police violence\" as a result. DAC Cundy also said that the public would have been left with a \"misleading impression\" without all information relating to Mr Kaba being published after trial, adding that there was \"clear potential for emotions tipping into disorder\". Mr Kaba, a construction worker who was due to become a father, had been followed by police on the day he was shot. After being boxed in by police cars, he drove backwards and forwards trying to ram his way free - Mr Blake said this made him believe one of his colleagues would be killed, and he opened fire to stop the car, the jury heard. Mr Kaba died from a single gunshot wound to the forehead. Bringing up the case in the Lords, former Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe said the legal system should give the benefit of the doubt to police officers. He described officers as \"brave men and women who on our behalf in a matter of a fraction of a second have to make the most awful decision\". One of Mr Blake's former colleagues, who was at the scene of Mr Kaba's shooting immediately after it happened, told the BBC he believed a system similar to an Army court martial would be more appropriate for such cases, rather than putting officers on trial.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Kaba's family said they were devastated by the verdict, and that the acquittal of Mr Blake \"wasn't just a failure for our family, but for all those affected by police violence\". About 150 people held a vigil outside the Old Bailey on Monday evening, some holding signs with slogans including \"this is not justice\" and \"police are perpetrators\". Sheeda Queen, a cousin of Mr Kaba, and a member of the Justice for Chris campaign group, described \"a deep pain of injustice, adding to the unbearable sorrow\". Another campaigner, Kayza Rose, said the outcome \"reinforces the harsh reality that police can kill without consequence\". She added: \"No-one can be safe while the police can kill with impunity. \"This verdict is not the end. It only strengthens our resolve.\u201d\n\nFloral tributes were left at Kirkstall Gardens where Chris Kaba was shot by a Met Police Officer\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said Mr Kaba had been charged with attempted murder. This has been changed to reflect that he was named on a charge sheet relating to the shooting after his death",
    "England make four changes to face South Africa\n\nLeicester Tigers duo Freddie Steward (left) and Jack van Poortvliet are two of England's three changes in the backs\n\nCoverage: Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nScrum-half Jack van Poortvliet and full-back Freddie Steward start for England against South Africa as head coach Steve Borthwick makes four changes to his starting XV. The Leicester pair have yet to feature in the Autumn Nations Series but come straight into the line-up in place of Ben Spencer and George Furbank. Ollie Sleightholme makes his first England start on the wing in place of the injured Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, while Sam Underhill comes in for Tom Curry, who is also missing with concussion. Sleightholme is rewarded with a maiden Test start after scoring his first international tries in the defeat by Australia, as Tom Roebuck is named on the bench. England, beaten 16-15 by South Africa in their 2023 World Cup semi-final, host the world champions looking for a first home win since the Six Nations in April. Borthwick's side have lost five of their past six matches, including narrow defeats from winning positions by New Zealand and the Wallabies this autumn. England last tasted victory in June against Japan, who they face in their final Autumn Nations Series game on 24 November. The Springboks arrive in London following victory over Scotland, having claimed their first Rugby Championship title since 2019 in September. Head coach Rassie Erasmus has made 12 changes to the side who won at Murrayfield, with captain Siya Kolisi returning to the starting XV.\n\nBoth Van Poortvliet and Steward, known to Borthwick from his time at Leicester Tigers, were regular starters last year. However, scrum-half Van Poortvliet suffered a tournament-ending injury before a ball was kicked at the World Cup, while Furbank took over the number 15 jersey from Steward during this year's Six Nations. \"Jack is a player that was playing a lot of games for England prior to the World Cup in 2023 and then had that nasty injury,\" Borthwick told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He has worked exceptionally hard to come back from that. \"He had a couple of niggles last season and probably wasn\u2019t quite at 100% but from what I have seen in training the last couple of weeks, the speed of ball Jack brings to the attacking game is exceptional and he is right up to his very best.\" England have shown signs of progress in their attacking intent and have led late on in each of their past four defeats. Borthwick's plan of kicking for both the posts and territory in a controlled performance nearly paid dividends against the Boks at the World Cup before a late Handre Pollard penalty denied them a spot in back-to-back finals. The inclusion of Steward - a reassuring presence in the backfield and under the high ball - suggests England could be planning to kick for the skies to stifle their visitors and play for territory. Borthwick added: \"It is the right time to bring Freddie in for this game. He has trained really well and played really well for his club so far this season. George is available and I'm pleased with what he has done in the last couple of weeks but I felt it was a physical game for him last week. \"South Africa kick more contestable kicks than anybody else in the world. It means you have to be very good under the high ball and have to be good in chasing the high ball.\" Van Poortvliet, meanwhile, is a strong box-kicker and will try to manoeuvre England into better areas on the field as well as spotting opportunities to throw the ball wide for Marcus Smith to threaten the gainline. The home crowd has yearned for more attacking rugby in recent weeks and, although England have gone some way towards delivering that, perhaps the best opportunity to get over the line against the world champions is to revert to type and play a controlled game.",

    "McMonagle was sentenced at Londonderry courthouse on Friday\n\nFormer Sinn F\u00e9in press officer Michael McMonagle has been jailed for child sex offences. He had already been placed on the sexual offenders' register after an earlier court appearance when he pleaded guilty to 14 charges. They relate to various dates between May 2020 and August 2021. On Friday at Londonderry Crown Court, McMonagle was sentenced to nine months in custody and a further nine months on licence.\n\nMcMonagle, 43, who has an address of Limewood Street in Londonderry, originally faced 15 charges, including attempting to incite two children to engage in sexual activity. He was also accused of 13 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child. At his first court appearance last year he was charged with three offences but 12 more were added later.\n\nOn Friday, the court in Derry heard how McMonagle had communicated with a number of online accounts which were run by police officers posing as children. The judge said that across all charges there had been \"in total six decoy/fictitious children ranging from 12 years to under 16 years\". According to the judge, McMonagle had said he was \"ashamed of his behaviour and deeply regretted the hurt and problems he had caused for other people\". Due to McMonagle's guilty plea, the judge said he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence. A defence barrister criticised the coverage of the case in the media and said there \"had been a near-total collapse of the truth\". He described the defendant as \"a victim of a media witch hunt\" and said the case had been \"politicised\".\n\nCh Supt Lindsay Fisher says McMonagle had \"combed the internet\"\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing on Friday, PSNI Ch Supt Lindsay Fisher described McMonagle as a \"predator who was combing the internet for underage victims\". Police said that, during an operation led by their child internet protection team, it was discovered that over the course of 15 months from May 2020, McMonagle interacted with a number of child profiles online with ages between 12 and 14. In August 2021, police said, he attempted to get what he believed to be multiple children aged 14 and under to perform sexual acts.\n\nDuring the same month, detectives seized a number of electronic devices from his home to capture evidence of chat logs, images and identified usernames he was using online. McMonagle was interviewed and charged to attend court in relation to the identified offences. \"Let this serve as a warning, we are everywhere. If you are attempting to communicate with a child online in a sexual way, you will be caught and you will face the full force of the law when you are,\u201d Ch Supt Fisher said.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Sinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said \"justice has been served\". \"I voice my appreciation to the system that has brought McMonagle to book and he will now be behind bars,\" she said. McMonagle had worked as a newspaper journalist in Derry before being employed as a Sinn F\u00e9in press officer in the north west. He was also an adviser for the party at Stormont for a number of years. In September it was revealed that two Sinn F\u00e9in press officers gave references for McMonagle, their former colleague, after he had been arrested and suspended from the party, but before he had appeared in court.",
    "How a communist from the Tata family became one of Britain's first Asian MPs\n\nShapurji Saklatvala was the nephew of Jamsetji Tata from the Tata Group\n\nThe name Shapurji Saklatvala may not be one that leaps out of the history books to most people. But as with any good tale from the past, the son of a cotton merchant - who was a member of India's supremely wealthy Tata clan - has quite a story. At every turn, it seems his life was one of constant struggle, defiance and persistence. He shared neither the surname of his affluent cousins, nor their destiny. Unlike them, he would not go on to run the Tata Group, which is currently one of the world's biggest business empires and owns iconic British brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley Tea. He instead became an outspoken and influential politician who lobbied for India's freedom in the heart of its coloniser's empire - the British Parliament - and even clashed with Mahatma Gandhi. But how did Saklatvala, born into a family of businessmen, pursue a path so different from his kin? And how did he blaze a trail to become one Britain's first Asian MPs? The answer is as complex as Saklatvala's relationship with the his own family.\n\nCommunist Party of Great Britain MPs Saklatvala Shapurji (left) and Walton Newbold (right)\n\nSaklatvala was the son of Dorabji, a cotton merchant, and Jerbai, the youngest daughter of Nusserwanji Tata, who founded the Tata Group. When Saklatvala was 14 years old, his family moved into Esplanade House in Bombay to live with Jerbai's brother, Jamsetji and his family. Saklatvala's parents separated when he was young and so, Jamsetji became the main paternal figure in his life. \"Jamsetji always had been especially fond of Shapurji and saw in him from a very early age the possibilities of great potential; he gave him a lot of attention and had great faith in his abilities, both as a boy and as a man,\" Saklatvala's daughter, Sehri, writes in The Fifth Commandment, a biography of her father. But Jamsetji's fondness of Saklatvala made his elder son, Dorab, resent his younger cousin. \"As boys and as men, they were always antagonistic towards each other; the breach was never healed,\" Sehri writes. It would eventually lead to Dorab curtailing Saklatvala's role in the family businesses, motivating him to pursue a different path. But apart from family dynamics, Saklatvala was also deeply influenced by the devastation caused by the bubonic plague in Bombay in the late 1890s. He saw how the epidemic disproportionately impacted the poor and working classes, while those in the upper echelons of society, including his family, remained relatively unscathed. During this time, Saklatvala, who was a college student, worked closely with Waldemar Haffkine, a Russian scientist who had to flee his country because of his revolutionist, anti-tsarist politics. Haffkine developed a vaccine to combat the plague and Saklatvala went door-to-door, convincing people to inoculate themselves. \"Their outlooks had much in common; and no doubt this close association between the idealist older scientist and the young, compassionate student, must have helped to form and to crystallise the convictions of Shapurji,\" Sehri writes in the book.\n\nA photo of Esplanade House, the Tata's house in Bombay\n\nAnother important influence was his relationship with Sally Marsh, a waitress he would marry in 1907. Marsh was the fourth of 12 children, who lost their father before becoming adults. Life was tough in the Marsh household as everybody had to work hard to make ends meet. But the well-heeled Saklatvala was drawn towards Marsh and during their courtship, he was exposed to the hardships of Britain's working class through her life. Sehri writes that her father was also influenced by the selfless lives of the Jesuit priests and nuns under whom he studied during his school and college years. So, after Saklatvala travelled to the UK in 1905, he immersed himself in politics with an aim to help the poor and the marginalised. He joined the Labour Party in 1909 and 12 years later, the Communist Party. He cared deeply about the rights of the working class, in India and in Britain, and believed that only socialism - and not any imperialist regime - could eradicate poverty and give people a say in governance. Saklatvala's speeches were well received and he soon became a popular face. In 1922, he was elected to parliament and would serve as an MP for close to seven years. During this time, he advocated ferociously for India's freedom. So staunch were his views that a British-Indian MP from the Conservative Party regarded him as a dangerous \"radical communist\". During his time as an MP, he also made trips to India, where he held speeches to urge the working class and young nationalists to assert themselves and pledge their support for the freedom movement. He also helped organise and build the Communist Party of India, external in the areas he visited.\n\nA photo of Saklatvala giving a speech in Hyde Park in 1933\n\nHis strident views on communism often clashed with Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach to defeat their common adversary. \"Dear Comrade Gandhi, we are both erratic enough to permit each other to be rude in order to freely express oneself correctly,\" he wrote in one of his letters to Gandhi, and proceeded to mince no words about his discomfort with Gandhi's non-co-operation movement and him allowing people to call him \"Mahatma\" (a revered person or sage). Though the two never reached an agreement, they remained cordial with each other and united in their common goal to overthrow British rule. Saklatvala's fiery speeches in India perturbed British officials and he was banned from traveling to his homeland in 1927. In 1929, he lost his seat in parliament, but he continued to fight for India's independence. Saklatvala remained an important figure in British politics and the Indian nationalist movement until his death in 1936. He was cremated and his ashes were buried next to those of his parents and Jamsetji Tata in a cemetery in London - uniting him once again with the Tata clan and their legacy.",

    "Trump had pleaded not guilty in the cases brought by the special prosecutor\n\nA US court has dismissed the last remaining federal criminal case against Donald Trump, which alleged that the president-elect illegally retained classified documents. The appeals court approved a dismissal request from Special Prosecutor Jack Smith on Tuesday. Earlier, on Monday, a separate case alleging that Trump illegally sought to overturn the 2020 election was also dismissed. Smith, who was appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland to investigate Trump, said in court filings that he requested the dismissals because the Justice Department is banned from prosecuting a sitting president, and not because of anything having to do with the substance of the cases.\n\nThe cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning charges could be refiled after Trump finishes his second term as president. In his request to drop the election case, Smith wrote: \"This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant.\" Trump had pleaded not guilty in both cases. After leaving office, Trump crossed into unprecedented legal territory for a former president, becoming the first to face a criminal trial and later conviction, in a case tied to a payment made to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. At the beginning of the year, he faced nearly 100 criminal charges connected to the two federal cases and others. The Supreme Court ruled this summer that a former president could not be prosecuted for \"official acts\" taken while in office, and Trump went on to win the election a few months later. Now almost all those charges have been dropped, with a case brought by prosecutors in Georgia currently on pause. Trump posted on his social media site Truth Social that the federal cases were \"empty and lawless, and should never have been brought\". \"It was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds,\" he wrote. Vice-President-elect JD Vance said the prosecutions were \"always political\". \"If Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison,\" he wrote. Trump has pledged to sack Smith as soon as he takes office in January. Smith has reportedly said he plans to step down next year. The dismissal of the cases marks an end to a lengthy legal saga. Smith had to refile the election-subversion charges against the former president based on the Supreme Court ruling that Trump was immune from some prosecution. The special counsel had argued in a revised indictment that Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results were related to his campaign and therefore not official acts. In the classified documents case, Trump was accused of storing dozens of sensitive files in his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, dismissed the charges after ruling Smith was improperly appointed to lead the case. Smith, however, appealed her decision, and the case was pending before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals before Tuesday's dismissal. The special prosecutor is continuing to pursue charges related to classified documents against two Trump employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. Both have also pleaded not guilty. In a filing on Tuesday, Smith said he was continuing to appeal partly to fight Judge Cannon's controversial ruling that the Attorney General did not have the legal power to appoint a special prosecutor. If he succeeds, the question may ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. In a statement, John Irving, an attorney for Mr De Oliveira, said: \"The Special Counsel\u2019s decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place. \"Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that\u2019s fine with us,\" Mr Irving said.\n\nClassified documents which formed the basis of the special prosecutor's case against Trump were stored in a bathroom at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort\n\nTrump\u2019s eminent return to the White House has left the state-level criminal cases against him in limbo, too. His sentencing for his criminal conviction in the state of New York, related to the Stormy Daniels payment, has been indefinitely delayed. In the Georgia case, where Trump also faces election subversion charges, an appeals court is considering whether to overturn a previous ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case despite a relationship she had with a prosecutor she hired. Since Trump won the 2024 presidency, \u201chis criminal problems go away\u201d, said former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. \u201cIt\u2019s well established that a sitting president can\u2019t be prosecuted,\u201d he said.",
    "New Bridget Jones film very sad, says Hugh Grant\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger and Hugh Grant are back for another Bridget Jones film\n\nBridget Jones fans have long adored the films for their cringe-worthy, hilarious and heartwarming scenes. But Hugh Grant has warned that the fourth instalment in the franchise - due out on Valentine's Day next year - will have a very different tone. Warning: If you don't want to know about the plot of Bridget Jones 4, look away now... \"As well as being extremely funny, it's very, very sad,\" said the actor, who will reprise his role as the dashing antagonist Daniel Cleaver. He also revealed that there was \"no obvious role\" for him in the film, but \"they wanted to cram me in\".\n\nOscar-winner Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is also back as the title character in Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. The film takes its title from the latest Bridget Jones novel, which was published in 2013.\n\nThe films chronicle the life of Bridget Jones, a working woman living in London\n\nIn the book, readers rejoin Bridget in her 50s, a mother to two children and widowed following the death of her husband Mark Darcy. Darcy was played by Colin Firth in the earlier Bridget Jones movies. The production studio has not commented on how closely the new film will follow the storyline of its paperback namesake, but it has been revealed author Helen Fielding has written the script. Speaking on the Graham Norton show, Grant indicated that Fielding had used a real-life tragedy to come up with the plotline. \"She had a sad story,\" he said. \"She got married to an American screenwriter, she had children and then he died.\" Grant said that Fielding then started writing a novel about a woman raising children by herself, and then realised the main character was \"a bit like Bridget\". \"So she made it into a Bridget Jones book,\" he said. \"And as well as being extremely funny, it's very, very sad.\"\n\nGrant, who is best known for starring in romcoms including Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, did not appear in the third film. He said that initially, he felt there was \"absolutely no role\" for his character, Daniel, in the fourth version either. \"But they wanted to cram me in,\" he said. So he said he sat down with producers to help shape the character, who was known in the earlier films for being a serial womaniser. \"I felt that what they proposed was fine, but not great. \"And I felt that he needed a third dimension, he's in his 60s now, you can't just have him smoothing his way down King's Road eyeing up young girls. \"Something needs to have happened to him in the interim. \"So we invented a rather good - I invented a rather good - interim story.\" The final version got his approval, he said. \"It's actually a very good and moving script. And I say that as someone who's horrid about scripts. This was brilliant.\"\n\nHugh Grant, Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth starred in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\n\nFielding's first book Bridget Jones's Diary was published in 1996 and a sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was released three years later. Written in the form of a personal diary, the novels chronicle the life of a hapless 30-something single working woman living in London. In 2001, the first film adaptation starring American actress Zellweger, with Grant as Daniel Cleaver and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, was released. Zellweger was Oscar-nominated for the role and, in 2004, the sequel was released, although it was not as critically well received. Emma Thompson, who debuted her character of Bridget's despairing obstetrician in the third film, Bridget Jones's Baby, is also set for a return in the fourth film. New faces on the cast list include Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave) and Leo Woodall (One Day), who is rumoured to play Bridget's younger love interest as she faces dating anew. Fielding previously said she had decided to write Mark Darcy out of the series because she didn't want Bridget to become \"a smug married\", a fate deemed utterly lamentable by earlier musings of Jones. Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy is set for UK release on Valentine's Day 2025.",
    "Niels Wittich was previously race director for the German Touring Cars Masters\n\nNiels Wittich has left his role as Formula 1's race director with immediate effect. The German, a replacement for Michael Masi in 2022, \"has stepped down from his position to pursue new opportunities,\" the FIA said in a statement. He will be replaced from the next race in Las Vegas by Rui Marques, most recently the race director for Formula 2 and 3. The surprise move has happened quickly. FIA staff were told earlier on Tuesday, BBC Sport has been told. An FIA spokesperson said: \"Niels has fulfilled his numerous responsibilities as race director with professionalism and dedication. We thank him for his commitment and we wish him the best for the future. \"Rui brings a wealth of experience having previously served as track marshal, scrutineer, national and international steward, deputy race director and race director in various championships.\"\n\nGermany's motorsport-magazin.com quoted Wittich saying: \"I have not resigned.\" Its F1 reporter Christian Menath said on X that Wittich had told him he was fired. The FIA said it could not provide any information beyond its official statement. It is highly unusual for an F1 race director to be changed during a season, especially given there are just three races remaining and both the drivers' and constructors' championships remain undecided. The decision was not widely expected within F1, although some insiders had heard Wittich would be replaced at the end of the season. A senior source said that Wittich had left earlier than expected as a result of his relationship with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem. Wittich is the latest in a series of senior people to leave the FIA in the past year. Sporting director Steve Nielsen quit the organisation in December 2023 after less than a year in his role. His departure followed that of Deborah Mayer, the head of the FIA commission for women. In January, leading engineer Tim Goss left his role as single-seater technical director. He is now at Red Bull's RB team. And in May Natalie Robyn left her role as chief executive officer, external after just 18 months in the position. Wittich's departure comes after a controversy concerning the FIA's racing guidelines broke out within F1 last month, following a battle between title contenders Max Verstappen and Lando Norris during the US Grand Prix. At the subsequent race in Mexico, the FIA agreed with the drivers that it would revise the guidelines with the aim of preventing a form of defence that has been perfected by Verstappen and is permitted by the current rules. Ben Sulayem's stewardship of the FIA has been marked by a series of controversies, the latest of which was a letter published last week by the Grand Prix Drivers' Association in which they asked to be treated like adults in the wake of Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc being punished for swearing. They also asked Ben Sulayem to mind his \"tone and language\" when addressing the topic, after he was criticised by Lewis Hamilton for using \"stereotypical\" language with a \"racial element\". It is not clear whether Wittich's departure is related to either scenario. His predecessor Masi left the FIA after his role in the controversy at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2021. Masi ignored the rules during a late safety-car period in that race and his decisions led to Lewis Hamilton, who had been on course to win an eighth world title by winning the race, being overtaken by Max Verstappen, making the Dutchman champion instead. Wittich has been less overtly controversial in his role, but there has remained an underlying discontent among teams and drivers about the management of FIA race control.",

Revealing the split, Mimii acknowledged \"a lot of you have been wondering about Josh and I and why we haven't been making appearances\". \"I know it's a big disappointment for a lot of you as it is for me too,\" she wrote. \"Your support for us hasn't gone unnoticed and I will forever be grateful for it.\" She finished her statement by telling fans they were \"the reason we made it to this point\".\n\nJosh and Mimi were photographed together at the NTAs but fans haven't seen them together much\n\nMimii, a mental health nurse from Portsmouth, coupled up with semi-professional footballer Josh, from Dartford, after returning single from Casa Amor. She'd originally been coupled up with Ayo Odukoya who returned from the other villa with a new partner, Jess Spencer. Josh was an island bombshell and after coupling up with Mimii they beat Ayo and Jess in the final, as well as other finalists Nicole Samuel and Ciaran Davies, and Matilda Draper and Sean Stone.\n\nIn the past, Love Island has faced criticism over how inclusive it is for black and Asian islanders. So when Mimii and Josh won, 1Xtra's Nadia Jae told BBC Newsbeat it was a big moment. \"For younger people that are watching, it\u2019s good to see that representation on a primetime show,\" she said. \"I do understand that it can\u2019t be everybody in the villa, but there are beautiful people from all different diasporas that need to be represented.\"\n\nThe 2024 series of Love Island was one of its best performing with audiences in years after a dip in viewing figures since its heyday in 2019. ITV said about 2 million people tuned in for the opening episode - up from 1.3 million in 2023. The series also featured TOWIE star Joey Essex who quickly became the bookies' favourite to win but divided fans over whether it was right for a celebrity to take part. He got the boot right before the finale, after former islanders were invited back to vote out one of the remaining couples.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "Why it was likely Sue Gray would go\n\nSue Gray has quit as the prime minister's chief of staff\n\nWhen I was leaked Sue Gray\u2019s salary last month, details of her pay were less important than what the leak revealed about the anger of those alongside her in government. In short, they were flipping angry - angry about her perceived power, her abilities, and they accused her of failing to sort out the pay of other special advisers, as they are known. Others, I should point out, felt it all amounted to a personal vendetta and was grossly unfair. But, fair or otherwise, the anger was very real.\n\nIt presented Sir Keir Starmer with few options: get rid of her, get rid of those unhappy with her, or solve the underlying problems. Solving the underlying problems looked difficult without either of the other two options happening too. And getting rid of all of those unhappy with her would have been difficult too \u2013 firstly, there were quite a few of them, and secondly finding them would not have been easy, as they had been making their feelings known discreetly. So did Sue Gray jump or was she pushed?\n\nI am told - by sources that have been consistently reliable through all of this - that a decision was made on Friday and the prime minister was willing to sack Sue Gray. He had decided, whatever she said, that she could no longer be his chief of staff. In the end they were able to find a mutually convenient role into which she could be demoted. And make no mistake, it is a massive demotion, into a part-time job that didn\u2019t previously exist. As it happens, there is a Council of the Nations and Regions happening on Friday at which the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, the first and deputy first ministers of Northern Ireland, and mayors from around England will gather. The prime minister will be there and so, I\u2019m told, we should expect Sue Gray to be too. But after that we shouldn\u2019t expect to see Sue Gray and the prime minister together very often - her time in Downing Street is now over. In truth, many in government had felt privately for some time her position was increasingly untenable \u2013 and will hope her ousting and the wider rejig will sharpen the government\u2019s sense of purpose and cut the number of own goals. A party that was ruthlessly well prepared for the election has looked rather less prepared for the realities of government. The promotion of Morgan McSweeney as Ms Gray\u2019s replacement and the arrival of James Lyons, a former political journalist turned communications director in both the public and private sector, are likely to give the operation a sharper political edge.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has appointed Morgan McSweeney as his new chief of staff\n\nTellingly, one element of the rejig is the government\u2019s list of planned announcements, known internally as \"the grid\", that had been under the command of Ms Gray. It will now be under the control of the No10 communications team, where some believe it should always have been. \u201cLook at that news grid, week after week after week of stories about freebies,\u201d one senior figure said to me the other day with an exasperated tone. They were articulating a double frustration \u2013 a frustration at the initial failure of judgement in accepting the donations and how they were spent, and a frustration at how long it had taken the party to deal with the row. Other Labour figures, though, are privately jittery that all this \u201clooks like the leakers have won\u201d, as one put it to me. Labour made much of saying they would offer an alternative to the chaos of recent Conservative administrations. And yet within weeks there was backbiting and infighting. The prime minister will hope this marks the end of it.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "The title of Barbara Taylor Bradford's most celebrated, and first, novel A Woman of Substance could well have been used to describe the author herself. The 1979 story of a young woman's journey from rags to riches went from bestseller to super-seller in a year and stayed on the New York Times list for 43 weeks. Bradford wrote more than 30 further books - again, all bestsellers - amounting to more than 90 million copies bought worldwide and netting her a fortune of more than \u00a3100m. Although she also wrote about male protagonists, Bradford's speciality was capturing the essence of what it meant to be a strong, determined woman fighting against the odds to succeed.\n\nHer stories were dense and epic - often period family sagas which ran into a book series - full of drama, passion and humanity which consequently made rich material for adaptation. Several of her novels were turned into TV films or miniseries, many produced by her adored and adoring husband of 55 years, Robert \"the General\" Bradford. Remarkably, given how prolific she was, Bradford always wrote in long-hand or on an electric typewriter and claimed almost never to have writer's block. She worked long, dogged hours and described herself to the Guardian as, external \"stoical and strong\" and with a \"backbone of steel,\" like her heroines.\n\nBarbara Taylor Bradford developed a taste for the finer things in life\n\nShe added: \"They're all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I've written about myself in every book.\" Bradford was born in 1933 in a suburb of Leeds and was an only child (her older brother died before she was born) doted on by her mother and father, who was an engineer. Although the family wasn't wealthy, the young Barbara was pampered and always impeccably turned out. \"I always had a new Whitsuntide bonnet and patent shoes and little white socks,\" she recalled in 2006., external\n\nJenny Seagrove starred as Emma Harte in the hit TV series A Woman of Substance\n\nAnd looking good became very much part of Bradford's larger-than-life adult persona, which was unerringly draped in designer elegance and expensive jewellery. She also developed a keen eye for priceless art. As for her formation, her mother had high hopes. She encouraged her to read classic literature, such as Dickens and the Brontes, and sent her to private school. Bradford later fictionalised her parents' marriage in her novel Act of Will. It was dedicated to her mother, who she said \"gave me the greatest gift a mother can give a child, the desire to excel\".\n\nBarbara Taylor Bradford was awarded an OBE in 2007\n\nA 2005 biography of Bradford suggested she was indeed descended from lofty stock by way of her mother, who was, it said, the illegitimate daughter of a marquis. Bradford was initially furious at the story, but with time said she'd \"come round\". Bradford's own writing aspirations began at the age of 10, when her proud mother sent a story her daughter had written to a magazine, and - after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it - she was hooked. At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but was soon taken on as a reporter.\n\nBarbara Taylor Bradford could never have too many handbags\n\n\"It was because I was such a bad typist and was ruining so much of their expensive paper!\" she joked. Nevertheless, at 18 she became the newspaper's Woman's Page editor. By the age of 20, she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \"I was very, very driven from the age of 10. That's what I wanted to be - a reporter,\" she recalled in 2019.\n\nDeborah Kerr starred in Hold the Dream as an older Emma Harte with Jenny Seagrove now playing Paula Fairley\n\nThe year 1961 turned out to be significant for Bradford after she was roped into a blind date. The unknown beau was the rich and successful film producer Robert Bradford. He was \"movie-star gorgeous,\" and it was pretty much love at first sight, she recalled. Two years later they were married and living in New York. She continued her career in journalism, including covering interior design and lifestyles, before trying her hand at children's and decorating books. But her childhood desire to write grown-up fiction was still bubbling under the surface. After several failed attempts at suspense novels, Bradford stopped and took stock. \"I was in my late thirties. I thought: what if I get to 55, and I've never written a novel? I'm going to hate myself. I'm going to be one of those bitter, unfulfilled writers,\" she said in her 2006 Guardian interview. That's when she embarked on the saga-driven journey that made her name, fortune and shaped her life, selling A Woman of Substance to a publisher on the strength of a 10-page outline and 192 pages.\n\nStephanie Beacham in the TV adaptation of Bradford's To Be The Best\n\nA Woman of Substance took her two years to write, with the original manuscript running to 1,520 pages. It told the story of Emma Harte, the kitchen maid of a wealthy Yorkshire family, who, through grit and fierce ambition, became the boss of a huge retail empire. Harte was ruthless but also warm-hearted and fair and readers loved her, making the novel a global best-seller. Realising she'd struck gold, Bradford went on produce six further Emma Harte novels, charting her growth and the lives of her children. Talking about the story's appeal, Bradford said, external it had \"everything in it\u2026 drama, intrigue, money, passion, power and revenge - all of those great human emotions that make for a good story\". \"Woman all over the world told me that Emma Harte was their true role model, and that the book had changed their lives for the better. \"I had set out to simply tell a good story about a strong woman. I hadn't intended to send a message. But apparently, quite unconsciously I had. \"All I know is that I wrote the kind of story I love to tell about an ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary in living her life a certain way and goes out to conquer the world.\"\n\nThe Cavendon Chronicles is another set of stories in a family saga\n\nA Woman of Substance was the first of her books to be adapted for TV. It became an Emmy Award-nominated series in 1985, starring Jenny Seagrove, Deborah Kerr and Liam Neeson. Two other books from the series were also made for TV, Hold the Dream and To Be the Best. Bradford revelled in her craft, writing at great lengths with novels often stretching to more than 500 pages. She wrote multiple stand-alone works yet, with often more ideas about her protagonists and their families than would fit into one book, Bradford produced further series, including The Ravenscar trilogy, The Clarendon Chronicles and The House of Falconer. The Ravenscar Dynasty (one of a trilogy), is set in Edwardian England, and told through the eyes of its handsome, kind but driven hero, Edward Deravenel, who is locked in a vicious battle for the family business.\n\n\"It's very dramatic and it's actually a retelling of the Wars of the Roses, but in modern times. I just took the life of Edward IV and told it in modern terms,\" Bradford explained to the Daily Express,, external adding she researched how to kill people with poisons, \"so there's quite a lot of deaths.\" And though the main character is male, the stories also unfailingly follow Bradford's formula of depicting strong, memorable women within the cast, along with another Bradford ingredient - passion. \"Women always say to me, 'Don't stop writing those nice sex scenes.' But, really, I'm more interested in the protagonist's character,\" Bradford told the Telegraph., external \"So, either she's going to be a wimp, and do nothing, or she's going to be driven and ambitious. Character is what drives everything forward.\" Accordingly, many of Bradford's novels had motivational titles such as To Be The Best, Everything to Gain and Her Own Rules.\n\nBarbara Taylor Bradford photographed at home in 1988 for the TV Times\n\nBarbara Taylor Bradford sold off some of her vast jewellery collection at auction\n\nRobert Bradford played a large role in his wife's work and, she said, shepherded her career. In addition to making screen versions of his wife's stories, he liked to be involved in their promotion. He was the first person to buy a full-page ad on the back page of the New York Times Arts section. Robert also loved to buy her gifts, most notably jewellery, no fewer than five pieces a year. She also accumulated countless handbags. When Robert died after having a stroke in 2019, Bradford was totally devastated. \"We were everything to each other,\" she said., external \"But I have to keep going. Bob always thought I was a strong woman. He liked strong women - never had time for those little fragile blondes.\" She had auctioned off some pieces of jewellery in 2013 and, following his death and her move into a smaller apartment, Bradford sold more, saying she just didn't have enough room. Eventually, Bradford found some solace by turning to her most-loved original characters, announcing she was writing a prequel to A Woman of Substance, this time focusing on Emma Harte's great friend Shane \"Blackie\" O'Neill. Quoted in the press release for the book, Bradford said: \"After my beloved husband, Bob Bradford, died in the summer, Blackie O'Neill came back into my head.\n\n\"Bob was by my side at the beginning when I wrote A Woman of Substance,\" she said, \"and I felt compelled to tell Blackie's story. The true Blackie O'Neill will be revealed and fans of Emma Harte will be able to live his tumultuous life with him.\" The book was due to be published in November 2020. Bradford was awarded an OBE in 2007 and recognised as one of 90 Great Britons celebrated in a special portrait to mark the Queen's 90th birthday. \"I might not always take myself seriously, but I take my work very seriously,\" she said of herself. And to those aspiring to match her at her art, Bradford cautioned: \"When people say: 'I want to write a novel and be rich and famous like you,' I say: 'Well, you're not going to be.' I say it to shock them. That is the wrong motivation. You should want to do the work so much that nothing else matters. I simply had to write fiction.\"",
    "'It's simple, really' - why Latinos flocked to Trump's working-class coalition\n\nDonald Trump has soared to a decisive election victory over Kamala Harris, lifted up by some of the very voters that Democrats once relied on. The Republican president-elect showed strength with the white working-class voters who first propelled him to the White House in 2016, while racking up huge support from Latino voters and putting in a better-than-expected performance among younger Americans, especially men. Among Latinos, a key part of the Democratic voter base for decades, Trump benefited from a mammoth 14 percentage-point bump compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls.\n\nNowhere is Trump's reshaping of the electorate more apparent than in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the highly coveted \"blue wall\" that helped propel Joe Biden to victory in 2020. This time, Trump won all three states, crushing Democrats' hopes that Harris could find a path to victory despite early election night losses in the southern states of North Carolina and Georgia. In his victory speech in Florida, Trump - who is set to win the popular vote too - credited the result to \"the biggest, the broadest, the most unified coalition\" in American history. \"They came from all quarters. Union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American,\" he told a roaring crowd. \"We had everybody, and it was beautiful.\" In Pennsylvania, the prized battleground state, Trump benefited from a huge swell of support from the state's growing Latino population.\n\nThere were about 600,000 eligible Latino voters in Pennsylvania, including a significant Puerto Rican population\n\nExit polls suggested Latinos in Pennsylvania amounted to about 5% of the total vote. Trump garnered 42% of that vote, compared to 27% when he ran against Joe Biden in 2020. The polls will continue to change as votes are counted, but are broadly representative of electoral trends. In the state's \"Latino belt\" - an eastern industrial corridor that has shifted to the right in the last two elections - some voters said they were not surprised by the result. \"It's simple, really. We liked the way things were four years ago,\" said Samuel Negron, a Pennsylvania state constable and member of the large Puerto Rican community in the city of Allentown. Mr Negron, and other Trump supporters in the now majority-Latino city, listed other reasons that their community was drifting towards Trump, including social issues and a perception that their family values now align more with the Republican Party.\n\nThe most common factor, however, was the economy - specifically, inflation. \"Out here, you pay $5 for a dozen eggs. It used to be $1, or even 99 cents,\" Mr Negron added. \"A lot of us have woken up, in my opinion, from Democratic lies that things have been better. We realised things were better then.\"\n\nMedia members and Republican supporters at a watch party in Wisconsin\n\nAhead of the election, polls also suggested that many Latinos - across the US and in Pennsylvania specifically - were drawn to Trump's proposals to block migrants at the US-Mexico border and enact much stricter immigration laws. Daniel Campo, a Venezuelan-American, said that Trump's claims of creeping \"socialism\" reminded him of the situation he left in his home country. \"I understand what [migrants] are leaving. But you have to do it the right way. I came the right way,\" he said. \"Things have to be done legally. Many of us were worried that the borders were just open\" under the Biden-Harris administration, he said. Collectively, the Latino shift towards Trump, his hold on white working-class voters and his increased support among non-college educated voters in general created an insurmountable obstacle for the Harris campaign. But Trump also improved his position in some surprising corners. In 2020 Joe Biden had a 24-point advantage with voters under 30. This time, that lead shrank to just 11 points. While nationally black voters still overwhelmingly supported Harris (85%), in Wisconsin Trump's support among that demographic more than doubled, from 8% in 2020 to 22% this election.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. US voters on one reason Trump won... and why Harris lost\n\nSome of the most significant battlegrounds in Wisconsin were the three counties surrounding Milwaukee known as the Wow counties - Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington. Harris failed to significantly improve upon Biden\u2019s 2020 vote share in these suburban areas, while also slipping in rural, whiter parts of the state dominated by Trump. Preliminary results also indicate that Harris failed to get as many votes as Biden in Wisconsin\u2019s biggest, most diverse city - Milwaukee. Michael Wagner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said her direct appeals to working-class voters may not have made much of a difference given the national political climate. Ted Dietzler cast his vote in a fire station on the outskirts of the small city of Waukesha. \u201cI\u2019m voting Trump because of the border, the economy, and no more wars,\u201d he said, wearing a Green Bay Packers hat. \u201cWe saw a huge difference when Trump was president,\u201d Dietzler said, adding that he was drawn to Trump\u2019s embrace of former Democrats like Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom appear set to have roles in the Trump administration. \u201cInflation is a big deal, and I don\u2019t think Harris quite gets it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll all just be better off with Trump back.\u201d\n\nNahim Uddin, 34, said he voted for Trump because of high interest rates\n\nTrump\u2019s national economic messaging hit home with working-class voters in the Midwestern state of Michigan, too. With nearly all votes counted, Trump is leading the state that he lost in 2020 by about 85,000 votes. He increased his vote share in rural areas as well as in Macomb County, home to many working-class voters in the Detroit suburbs. One of them, Nahim Uddin, a delivery driver and former Ford car-worker, cast his ballot for Trump because he said the former president would drive down prices. \u201cI went to go purchase a car - the interest rates had skyrocketed,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole reason I voted for him.\u201d The same was true for Yian Yian Shein, a small business owner in the city Warren, who said Trump would lower income taxes and help people like her. Democrats tried to tailor their economic messages in Michigan, touting their investments in electric car manufacturing while securing an endorsement from United Automobile Workers president Shawn Fain, a frequent Trump critic. But Republicans were able to \u201cneutralise\u201d those messages by arguing that the transition to electric vehicles would come at the cost of jobs, said Michigan State University professor Matt Grossmann. Ultimately what cost Democrats among blue-collar voters across demographic groups was the perception that they were to blame for high prices and pinched budgets. \u201cLargely, voters have felt economic pain due to the post-Covid inflationary period, and they\u2019re taking it out on Biden\u201d and Harris, said University of Michigan professor Jonathan Hanson.\n\u2022 None What Happens When You Become US President?\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Strikes set to close Perth and Kinross schools for two weeks\n\nUnison members have rejected the national pay offer for council staff\n\nStrike action is set to close schools in Perth and Kinross for two weeks after the largest council union rejected a national pay deal. The walkout by non-teaching Unison members is due to begin on 21 October and will affect 50 schools and early years centres. It will start immediately after the two-week October school holiday, meaning schools could be shut for a full month. Finance Secretary Shona Robison said \"no-one's interests will be served by industrial action which will disrupt children attending schools and nurseries\".\n\nA Perth and Kinross Council spokesman said the local authority was assessing how the action will impact schools. He said: \"Our intention is to minimise the impact on our children, parents and carers as much as possible and will be issuing further information as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe local government body Cosla also urged Unison to reconsider the offer which it described as \"fair, above-inflation and strong\". Thousands of Unison members (86%), including waste and recycling workers as well as education staff, turned down the national offer. That offer was for a \u00a31,292 per year or 3.6% rise \u2013 whichever was higher. It was accepted by the two other big council unions, Unite and the GMB. Councils across Scotland have agreed to implement the offer, meaning staff should get their rise and back pay soon. The Scottish government and council leaders have said there is no more money for pay this year. Meanwhile, Unison has also warned it will ballot all its council members across Scotland to see if they will go on strike.\n\nParent Jack South said he was concerned about children getting the education that they need.\n\nThe Unison action is targeting the constituency of First Minister John Swinney. Jack South from Perthshire, who has an eight-year-old son, said the targeted action was \"playing politics\" with children's lives. He said: \"It's not the children's fault. The thing that's affecting the kids is learning in school. \"I'm more concerned about the children not getting the education that they need.\" Grandmother Jacqui Duncan said: \"I just think it's totally out of order that they're going on strike for two whole weeks - it's not like the odd day here and there. \"It's going to really affect a lot of children and a lot of parents who have to give up their own work to look after these kids. \"Not everybody can afford childcare, which is extortionate. I just think it's in very bad taste.\"\n\nGrandmother Jacqui Duncan said childcare during strikes could cause problems\n\nUnison's Perth and Kinross branch secretary Stuart Hope said taking strike action \"is the last thing school and early years staff want to do\". But he added: \u201cEmployees are taking this first stand on behalf of all local government workers because they\u2019ve seen a decade of pay cuts and they see other sectors being offered deals of greater value. \u201cThe Scottish government needs to understand that council staff need more than platitudes. Ministers must tackle the severe decline in local government funding and start to value councils and their dedicated workforce as they do other areas of public services.\"\n\nThe finance secretary said she hoped that Unison members would \"recognise the strength\" of the offer, pointing out it had already been accepted by GMB and Unite. Robison said: \"The pay offer is better than that made to local government workers in the rest of the UK and will see the lowest-paid workers, including Unison members, receive a 5.63% pay increase.\" Cosla spokesperson Katie Hagmann said the pay offer was \"at the absolute limit of affordability\" in the extremely challenging financial climate. She added: \"There is no further funding available to increase the value of the offer. \"We are aware that communities will be concerned about the detrimental impact industrial action would have, particularly for our children and young people. \"Industrial action is in nobody\u2019s interests, and we urge Unison to reconsider.\"\n\nAs far as councils are concerned, this year's pay rise is not open to renegotiation. The offer - made to see off the threat of bin strikes - was accepted by members of two of the three big council unions. Councils agreed to put the offer into practice so staff should get their increase soon, along with backpay to April. Council body Cosla and the Scottish government are adamant there is no more money for pay this year. But as far as Unison is concerned, the issue remains far from resolved. It wants action to deal with what it sees as a big decline in the value of council pay in recent years. Action in Perth and Kinross has the potential to cause disruption in First Minister John Swinney's constituency. Unison knows this. But the action there might only be a taste of things to come. It intends to ballot council staff across Scotland to see if they will strike over pay. A mandate for action is not a given. The turnout may be too low, even if a majority of those who vote support striking. The stakes in this dispute are high for councils, the Scottish government and Unison. Will this year's pay offer be reopened? Will undertakings be given about next year's? Or will strikes simply highlight how some council staff feel that the services they provide are not properly funded?",
    "Trump vows to use US military for mass deportations\n\nDonald Trump said he plans to declare a national emergency, which would authorise him to deploy troops on US soil\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has confirmed on his social media network that he plans to use the US military to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented migrants. On Monday, he posted \"TRUE!!!\" in response to a conservative commentator who wrote that Trump would declare a national emergency and use military assets to lead \u201ca mass deportation program\u201d. At campaign events, Trump repeatedly pledged to mobilise the National Guard to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency tasked with carrying out deportations. Trump's latest comment comes as questions grow about how he would fulfil his pledge to execute the largest mass deportation in US history.\n\nHe has repeatedly said he would begin deportations on his first day in office, which will be 20 January 2025. But even if a US administration was able to legally move ahead with these plans, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges. For example, experts are doubtful that ICE's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down millions of undocumented migrants. There would also be a major financial cost, but Trump recently told NBC News, external that this would not deter his administration's efforts. Trump's post was made on his Truth Social network early on Monday as he continues to announce his nominations for key posts in his administration.\n\nTrump has already chosen several loyal allies for top roles overseeing immigration and deportation policy, including Kristi Noem who has been nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and former ICE chief Tom Homan who Trump has named his \"border tsar\". Trump's team have so far released few details about how the plan will be executed. He has previously said that he plans to declare a national emergency, which would authorise him to deploy troops on US soil. Homan told Fox News on Monday that he will visit Trump's Florida home this week \"to put the final touches on the plan\", including deciding what role the US Department of Defense (DOD) will have. \"Can DOD assist? Because DOD can take a lot off our plate,\" he said, saying that the pace of deportations will depend on the resources agencies are given. On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued ICE for more details on how the deportation plan will work. The group plans to continue to file legal challenges in an effort to block the mass deportation. Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior. The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
    "'Pray' for Davina and '\u00a3280 hike to bills'\n\nThe Guardian leads with a claim that the growing addiction, external to unhealthy food costs the UK \u00a3268bn a year. The figure, which is more than the NHS budget, has been calculated in a report by the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission. It found that increasing consumption of food that was high in fat, salt and sugar was having a \"devastating\" effect on human health and Britain's finances. The University of Surrey economist, Tim Jackson, who carried out the research, tells the paper the cost is \"staggering\".

    "The girl who went to buy cornflakes and never came home\n\nLindsay Rimer liked Nirvana, the Prodigy and had dreams of one day studying at university\n\nOn a rainy November night in 1994, Lindsay Rimer walked the short route from her home to a local shop to buy breakfast cereal. The 13-year-old's body was discovered weighed down in a nearby canal months later. In her pocket, the exact change from the cornflakes she had bought. Her killer has never been caught. Senior detectives are not usually immediately alerted to a missing teenager. On the day the alarm was raised Tony Whittle was chatting with colleague Graham Sunderland. The conversation turned to the cases they were working on, with Graham saying the force received a call that morning about a young girl who had not turned up for her daily paper round. Her parents were frantic because it appeared she had not been home all night.\n\nWhether it was professional judgement or gut feeling, the men agreed there was something they could not put their finger on that left them concerned. Then a detective superintendent in the murder squad, Tony was based in Bradford where it was not too unusual for teenagers to disappear overnight before re-emerging the next day. But this was Hebden Bridge. Eight miles (12km) outside of Halifax in West Yorkshire, a hippie-spirited town surrounded by rolling hills and stone bridges. The definition of a community where everyone knows everyone. Although no-one in Lindsay Rimer's family knew it yet, their lives had changed forever.\n\nGeri and Gordon Rimer make an appeal to the public for help in finding their missing daughter\n\n\"We were just a normal family before that night. Then it all exploded,\" recalls Kate, Lindsay\u2019s elder sister who was 20 when she disappeared. One of three girls, Kate was a new mum and living near the family home on Cambridge Street. Lindsay would often come for a sleepover. Having realised there were no cornflakes for breakfast the next day, at 22:00 GMT on 7 November Lindsay had walked less than a mile to the Spar on Crown Street. When she left the house, her dad was on the phone so Lindsay called at the nearby Trades Club where her mum was meeting friends and got some money from her so she could buy the cereal. After her mum returned later, Lindsay's parents went to bed assuming their daughter had come home and gone straight up to her attic room. But the next morning they were called by the newsagents where Lindsay worked to say she had not turned up. \"Mum and dad realised her paper delivery bag was still in the kitchen along with her school money. They ran upstairs and realised she hadn't slept in her bed. \u201cThey knew straight away something had happened,\" Kate says.\n\nLindsay did not turn up for her paper round at Forbuoys Newsagents, her brightly coloured bag hung up with the coats at home\n\nGraham (left) and Tony were at the forefront of police efforts to solve the case. In this media appeal Lindsay's dad Gordon (right) speaks to the press\n\nGrainy CCTV footage from the shop captured Lindsay leaving at 22:22 GMT. She was spotted moments later by two bus passengers as she leant against a wall near to the town\u2019s Memorial Garden. That was the last confirmed sighting of her alive. In the early days of her disappearance, police and the community joined forces and combed the area, hoping to bring the teenager home. Three close friends of Geri and Gordon moved in with the family. Together, they would spend nights brainstorming, writing down potential leads or information on a flip chart - anything that could help find Lindsay. A week into the search and Kate, who describes being \"plucked from normality into a world of crime and press,\" played the role of her sister in a televised reconstruction. It was hoped tracing her last movements would jog people's memories. Kate remembers: \"I was insistent I wanted to take part. She was my build and we looked similar. I felt it was the least I could do to try and find her.\" \"I look back at photos of myself at the time and the reconstruction and I look so young. I don't recognise myself but I recognise the terror in my face,\" she adds.\n\nKate Rimer, pictured in 1994, was determined to take part in the reconstruction of her sister's last known movements\n\nAs the investigation wore on Kate says she remembers when officers, growing increasingly desperate for a breakthrough, searched the home of every man in the town. There were rumours of sightings in other parts of the country. One man told police he had seen Lindsay being dragged into a car and had followed it to a nearby reservoir but his claims were disproved. Tony reflects: \"All we had was this CCTV picture of her in her big baggy jumper and jeans and that was it.\" \"There were people around at the time and had she been dragged into a vehicle kicking and screaming, someone would have seen or heard.\"\n\nDetectives believe Lindsay may have been killed by someone she knew\n\nThe lack of sightings led detectives to believe Lindsay had got into a vehicle with someone she knew. She was described as an \"intelligent, cautious girl\" who would not have gone off with a stranger. The investigation gained national attention, generating a sense of fear about how a schoolgirl could vanish in a place like Hebden Bridge. An offender profile drawn up by a psychiatrist suggested the likely suspect would be someone who could drive, probably aged 17 to early 20s, and perhaps someone Lindsay would be attracted to. Could it be someone she had met recently or maybe an older brother of someone she knew?\n\nThere were hopes of a breakthrough after identifying the driver of a stolen Honda Civic\n\nSeveral weeks into the inquiry and there was hope of a breakthrough. Exhausted detective Tony had been persuaded to take his first day off in weeks when he received a call to say officers had tracked down the driver of a stolen red Honda Civic. The vehicle had been spotted around the town when Lindsay disappeared. It was thought the driver had attempted to talk to schoolgirls. Tony remembers: \"I thought, 'right, that's our guy, let's get him in'.\" However, it turned out the man had an alibi and was ruled out. \"He was actually being spoken to by a police officer miles away at about the time Lindsay would have left the shop,\" he adds. As the months wore on, and with the absence of any concrete leads, the inquiry was beginning to wind down.\n\nThe schoolgirl's body was found at Rawden Mill Lock\n\nThen in April 1995, Lindsay's body was found a mile out of the town centre in the Rochdale Canal by two council workers clearing debris from the waterway. Kate says: \"I remember it clearly. I was sat in the park watching my daughter play. \u201cMy dad walked down and sat next to me. He said they'd found a body and we needed to go back to the house. \"It wasn't a shock because after so long we weren't expecting her to come home. But it was just deeply sad.\" Lindsay had been strangled - likely killed on the night she vanished and her body dumped. The arms of her jumper had been tied together in a sling with a stone used to weigh her down. There was no suggestion of a sexual assault. Being submerged in the water for so long had erased any chance of forensic clues that might help police.\n\nJuliet (left) and Kate Rimer say their family has been left \"broken\" by the murder of their sister\n\nHundreds of witness statements were taken. Officers spoke to thousands of people, examined hundreds of vehicles and made repeated appeals, but no progress was made. Over the years the case has remained open and there have been moments where a breakthrough appeared within touching distance. In April 2016, police believed that scientific advances had enabled them to create a DNA profile which may lead them back to the killer. A 63-year-old man was arrested in November of that year with a 68-year-old from Bradford arrested in April 2017. Both were later released without charge. Three decades on, Lindsay's younger sister Juliet reflects on how she has no living memory of her sibling. A baby when she disappeared, Juliet has grown up knowing Lindsay to exist only in the context of murder and death. She talks about a childhood where her family were in a \"perpetual cycle of grief\". \"I don't think there was one particular instance where I found out I had a sister that was killed. \"You can't have a conversation with your young child about murder so it was something I pieced together over the years.\" The shadow of Lindsay's murder still looms across Hebden Bridge and weighs heavily on the minds of both former and current officers. Graham, who was a detective inspector on the investigation, says he thinks about the case often and it was the only one in his career that officers hadn't solved.\n\nThe original case detectives, Tony Whittle and Graham Sunderland, who are now retired, say they still believe Lindsay's killer can be found\n\nAlthough now retired, he is desperate for the case to be solved: \"We need to know what happened to Lindsay. No matter how insignificant, if someone knows something, for heaven's sake come forward.\" \"It's a little girl I've never met and yet I know really well,\" he adds.\n\u2022 None 'Now's the time to talk over murdered schoolgirl' The detective now heading up the inquiry says police are still committed to finding the killer and getting justice for the Rimers. Det Ch Insp James Entwistle says: \"Loyalties change around people who know things, science moves on. There is always an opportunity and always a drive because this is a relentless pursuit for the truth.\" The wounds of not knowing remain unhealed for Lindsay\u2019s family. Kate describes her parents as \"broken\" with the whole family \"exhausted by grief\". They have created a memory box of their sister. They talk about a young teenager who had a love of fashion, was into Nirvana and the Prodigy and was keen to go to university. But for self-preservation Kate and Juliet can't focus too much on what Lindsay's life may have been like. \"For our own wellbeing, we cannot go there. \u201cIt's too painful to think about what she would be doing and what she's missed out on.\" The family\u2019s only way of finding peace is to find the killer. Kate says: \"If you've experienced a death in the family you're allowed to move on from it. \u201cYou can forge a life where you encompass grief, but it doesn't overwhelm it. \"But we're stuck in this overwhelm all the time because we don't have closure. \u201cWe can only move on when we know who is responsible for killing our sister.\"\n\u2022 None Anyone affected by the issues raised in this piece can access help and support via the BBC Action Line.",
    "At least five dead in attack at Turkish aviation company\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAt least five people have been killed and 22 injured in an attack at the headquarters of an aviation company near the Turkish capital Ankara, authorities have confirmed. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said that the two attackers, a woman and a man, have been \"neutralised\", adding that the attack had most likely involved Kurdish rebel group the PKK. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Turkey's defence ministry announced late on Wednesday that air strikes had been launched at Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria.\n\nVarious videos from the attack earlier on Wednesday show at least two people firing guns around the entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), which is located some 40km (25 miles) outside the capital. Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. Local media had earlier reported that the attackers killed the cab driver before taking his vehicle to carry out the attack. The blast took place around the time of a shift change, and staff had to be directed to shelters, they said. Yerlikaya also confirmed that seven special ops forces members were among the 22 who were injured in the attack. The PKK is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country\u2019s significant Kurdish minority. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who is in Russia for the Brics summit - condemned what he called a \"vile terror attack\" during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in remarks broadcast live on TV. He later posted a lengthy statement on X, saying that security forces acted quickly to neutralise the threat, and that \"no terrorist organisation, no evil focus targeting our security will be able to achieve their goals\".\n\nTurkish authorities have imposed a media blackout on details of the attack, and users in large areas of the country have reported not being able to use social media sites like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and X. The president of Turkey\u2019s Radio and TV Supreme Council, Ebubekir Sahin, warned that all images relating to the incident should be removed from social media, and urged users not to share images which \u201cwill serve the purpose of terrorism\u201d.\n\nTAI is a key player in Turkey\u2019s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use. It is the company designated by the Nato member to be the licensed manufacturer for the US-designed F-16 fighter jets. TAI also plays a role in modernising older aircraft for use by the Turkish military. The firm's two principal owners are the Turkish Armed Forces and a civilian arm of Turkey's government charged with improving its defence capabilities and managing military procurement. The blast took place as a major trade fair for defence and aerospace industries was going on in Istanbul this week.\n\nAre you in the region? If it is safe to do so, get in touch.",
    "Russia and US battle for advantage in Ukraine war ahead of Trump's return\n\nRussia has resumed large-scale missile strikes on Ukraine as it seeks to maximise its military advantage\n\nIn a matter of days US President Joe Biden's administration and Russia have made separate - but significant - moves aimed at influencing the outcome of the war in Ukraine, two months ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. There is a sense of Moscow maximising its gains and of Biden abandoning long-held red lines before Trump seeks to deliver on his claim to end the war in 24 hours. Ukraine has already acted on Biden\u2019s decision to let Kyiv fire first long-range Atacms missiles deep into Russian territory. As Kyiv struggles to hold on to its territory in the east, Biden has promised to send anti-personnel landmines too as part of new military assistance worth nearly $300m (\u00a3239m). What prompted Biden\u2019s change of heart appears to have been the arrival of thousands of North Koreans deployed to the front line, which the US sees as a \u201cmassive escalation\u201d. But Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up the tension still further by loosening the conditions of use for Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons. That \u201ceffectively eliminates\u201d defeat on the battlefield, claims Moscow. One Russia commentator suggested Putin might view the current situation as an \u201cin-between\u201d moment that gives him the sense he has the upper hand in Ukraine.\n\nThe US Atacms missile system can hit targets at a distance of 190 miles (300km)\n\nAt the start of this week, Russia launched its biggest aerial attack on Ukraine for almost three months. Amid fears of a renewed strike on Wednesday, several Western embassies closed their doors. \"It\u2019s all connected,\" says Mykhaylo Samus, head of the New Geopolitics Research Network in Ukraine. He argues Russia has been stockpiling hundreds of Iskander and Kinzhal missiles for weeks to enable it to carry out strikes and thus send a psychological message ahead of the transfer of power in Washington DC. Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, may have been spared on Wednesday, but the message got through. \u201cEverything is about preparing for a strong position for talks with Trump, to understand Russia is not going to make compromise and everything depends on [Ukraine's President Volodymyr] Zelensky.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s clearly an effort ahead of Trump to maximise their standings,\u201d agrees Jade McGlynn, from the war studies department at King\u2019s College London. She is highly sceptical that a deal with Putin is possible - and that ultimately his aim is to subjugate Russia\u2019s south-western neighbour.\n\nUkraine marked 1,000 days since Russia's full-scale invasion on Tuesday with Russian forces waging relentless attacks in a bid to seize key hubs in the east of Ukraine. The mood in Moscow appears to be that it is only a matter of time before Ukraine is in its hands, says Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. From January, however, Putin will have to consider other factors, she says: \u201cHe will have to deal with the fact that Trump now is responsible for the situation. If Putin escalates, it can worsen the chances for a deal. He will have to be more flexible, more open to different options.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration announced new military assistance for Ukraine to include ammunition, missiles and drones, as well as anti-personnel landmines. The US leader's decision to allow Kyiv to begin firing Atacms into Russian territory was clearly directed at helping Kyiv, but it was felt by the Trump entourage, too. Although Trump has so far said nothing, his pick for National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, spoke of \u201canother step up the escalation ladder and nobody knows where this is going\u201d. He did not go as far as some on the Trump team. Donald Trump Jr complained Biden was trying to \u201cget World War Three\u201d going before his father could even return to the White House. \"There's one president at a time,\" said state department spokesman Matthew Miller \"When the next president takes office, he can make his own decisions.\u201d Some Republicans have backed Biden\u2019s move, although Sen Lindsay Graham said he should have done it \u201cto help Ukraine and he\u2019s playing politics with it\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s reaction may or may not be an empty threat. Under its revised nuclear doctrine, Moscow will now be able to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries that are backed by nuclear powers, and if it comes under \u201cmassive\u201d air attack, too. Alexander Yermakov from the Russian International Affairs Council says the change is not so much as an operational manual for using nuclear weapons, but \u201cprimarily it serves as a declaration to potential adversaries, outlining the scenarios in which such measures could be considered\u201d. Another message from Putin to the West, then.\n\nTatiana Stanovaya believes it is not that he wants to start World War Three, but because \u201che believes he must scare the Western elites to show they are playing with fire\u201d. What happens beyond January is anyone's guess. Kremlin insiders have already begun briefing about their minimal demands from any Trump initiative to end the war, and Volodymyr Zelensky has begun making his position clear too. Asked in a US TV interview what would happen to Ukraine if Washington slashed military aid, he was clear: \"If they will cut, I think we will lose. Of course, anyway, we will stay and we will fight. We have production, but it\u2019s not enough to prevail.\" Putin insists Ukraine will have to remain neutral for any relations to work, even though it is now part of Ukraine\u2019s constitution to join both Nato and the European Union. A Reuters news agency report on Wednesday cited Russian officials saying Putin might be open to pulling out from relatively small patches of territory but nothing bigger. Zelensky on Tuesday presented his 10-point \u201cresilience plan\u201d to parliament, and one defiant message rang out in the Verkhovna Rada more than most. \u201cMaybe Ukraine will have to outlive someone in Moscow in order to achieve all its goals... to restore the full integrity of Ukraine.\u201d One day Russia would be without Putin, in other words, but Ukraine would be going nowhere. For Ukrainians that wait could take years, says Mykhaylo Samus, but they would never consent to abandoning Crimea or any other territory under Russian occupation. The most Zelensky might be prepared to sign would be a ceasefire without commitments, he believes. Anything else would lead to internal conflict as many would view it as a betrayal. Ahead of any talks Mykola Bielieskov of the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv believes the key is to prevent any major Russian breakthrough in the east. \u201cFor us it\u2019s just necessary to localise [Russian] advances\u2026 using Atacms, anti-personnel landmines or whatever. Because if the Russians are successful they would try to dictate terms.\u201d Speaking to the BBC from Kharkiv, Jade McGlynn said few Ukrainians believed Trump would be able to engineer any kind of lasting peace deal. Any kind of settlement that left Ukraine in a much worse position would lead to political chaos, she said. \u201cEurope needs to step up,\u201d she said, \u201cand ultimately we know that the Scandinavians, Baltic states and Poland are not enough.\u201d",
    "Sheeran wishes he wasn't on the new Band Aid song\n\nEd Sheeran sang on the 30th anniversary version of Do They Know It's Christmas in 2014\n\nEd Sheeran says that Band Aid did not ask for permission to re-use his vocals on a new 40th anniversary version of Do They Know It's Christmas? Writing on Instagram, the star said he would have \"respectfully\" declined the request, citing a post by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG that criticised foreign aid in Africa. Sheeran sang alongside Coldplay, Sinead O'Connor, Sam Smith, One Direction and Rita Ora on Band Aid 30 in 2014. A new mix, released next week, blends his vocals with those of Sting from the original 1984 version of the charity song. \u201cMy approval wasn\u2019t sought on this new Band Aid 40 release,\" Sheeran said. \"Had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals.\"\n\nHe continued: \u201cA decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed, eloquently explained by @fuseodg. \"This is just my personal stance, I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a forward-looking one. Love to all x.\u201d\n\nBand Aid 30 also saw contributions from Paloma Faith, Clean Bandit, Bastille, Sinead O'Connor, One Direction, Angelique Kidjo, Ellie Goulding, Olly Murs and Jessie Ware.\n\nIn his post, Fuse ODG said he had turned down the invitation to take part in Band Aid 30 alongside Sheeran, 10 years ago. \"I refused to participate in Band Aid because I recognised the harm initiatives like it inflict on Africa,\" he wrote. \"While they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa's economic growth, tourism, and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity.\" Speaking to BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the musician said that Do They Know It's Christmas perpetuates the idea that Africa is plagued by \"famine and poverty\", which is \"not the truth\". When he first saw the Band Aid videos as a child, he said, the images were \"so negative that I wanted to disassociate myself from being African because there was no sense of pride in it.\" The musician, whose real name is Nana Richard Abiona, added that he had asked Bob Geldof to consider those concerns in 2014. \"All I said to him was, there's a way to do things without destroying our collective pride. There's a way to do things without it costing us in tourism, in investment, you know? \"We could make it more like a partnership - solidarity instead of charity.\" The BBC has asked Band Aid for a response to Sheeran and Fuse ODG's comments.\n\nThe latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas? was announced last week. It will combine different versions of the charity single that have been recorded over the years, featuring stars such as Boy George, Harry Styles, George Michael, Sam Smith, the Sugababes, Bono, Bananarama, Robbie Williams, Thom Yorke, Rita Ora, Dizzee Rascal and Paul McCartney. The new \"ultimate mix\" will premiere on British radio stations on the morning of 25 November, the 40th anniversary of the original song being recorded.\n\nBob Geldof has defended Band Aid, highlighting the number of lives it has saved\n\nThe charity single was conceived as a way to tackle the famine that devastated Ethiopia in 1984. Over the years, the song's lyrics have been criticised for their patronising portrayal of Africa as a barren land that needed rescuing by Western intervention. This \"ignorant and colonial attitude, external\", wrote Indrajit Samarajiva in 2023, was \"more about making white people feel good than helping anyone\". Over the weekend, Bob Geldof - who organised and co-wrote Do They Know It's Christmas? with Midge Ure - defended the song, external in response to an article published in The Conversation. \"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive,\" he wrote. \"In fact, just today Band Aid has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to help those running from the mass slaughter in Sudan and enough cash to feed a further 8,000 children in the same affected areas of Ethiopia as 1984. \"Those exhausted women who weren\u2019t raped and killed and their panicked children and any male over 10 who survived the massacres and those 8,000 Tigrayan children will sleep safer, warmer and cared for tonight because of that miraculous little record. \"We wish that it were other but it isn\u2019t.

    "As communist China turns 75, can Xi fix its economy?\n\nThe stimulus measures sparked a stock market rally but economists are unsure they can fix deeper issues\n\nAs China prepared to celebrate its Golden Week holiday and mark the 75th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic, the ruling Communist Party rolled out a raft of measures aimed at boosting its ailing economy. The plans included help for the country's crisis-hit property industry, support for the stock market, cash handouts for the poor and more government spending. Shares in mainland China and Hong Kong chalked up record gains after the announcements. But economists warn the policies may not be enough to fix China's economic problems.\n\nSome of the measures announced by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on 24 September took direct aim at the country's beaten-down stock market. The new tools included funding worth 800bn yuan ($114bn; \u00a385.6bn) that can be borrowed by insurers, brokers and asset managers to buy shares. PBOC governor, Pan Gongsheng, also said the central bank would offer support to listed companies that want to buy back their own shares and announced plans to lower borrowing costs, and allow banks to increase their lending. Just two days after the PBOC's announcement, President Xi Jinping chaired a surprise economy-focused meeting of the country's top leaders, known as the Politburo. Officials promised to intensify government spending aimed to support the economy. On Monday, the day before China headed off for a weeklong holiday, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index jumped by more than 8%, in its best day since the 2008 global financial crisis. The move capped off a five-day rally that saw the index jump by 20%. The following day, with financial markets closed on the mainland, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose by over 6%. While investors may have been popping champagne corks, Xi has deeper issues to tackle.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has marked the 75th anniversary of the People's Republic of China\n\nThe People's Republic marking its 75th anniversary means it has been in existence longer than the only other major communist state, the Soviet Union, which collapsed 74 years after it was founded. \"Avoiding the fate of the Soviet Union has long been a key concern for China's leaders,\" said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. At the forefront of officials' minds will be boosting confidence in the broader economy amid growing concerns that it may miss its own 5% annual growth target. \"In China targets must be met, by any means necessary,\" said Yuen Yuen Ang, professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \"The leadership worries that failing to meet them in 2024 will worsen a downward spiral of slow growth and low confidence.\"\n\nOne of the main drags on the world's second-largest economy has been the downturn in the country's property market, which began three years ago. Aside from policies aimed at boosting stocks, the recently unveiled stimulus package also targeted the real estate industry. It includes measures to increase bank lending, mortgage rate cuts and lower minimum down payments for second-home buyers. But there is scepticism that such moves are enough to shore up the housing market. \"Those measures are welcome but unlikely to shift the needle much in isolation,\" said Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics. \"China\u2019s weakness stems from a crisis of confidence, not one of credit; firms and families don\u2019t want to borrow, regardless of how cheap it is to do so.\" At the Politburo session, China\u2019s top leaders vowed to go beyond interest rate cuts and tap government funds to boost economic growth. However, other than setting priorities like stabilising the property market, supporting consumption and boosting employment, the officials offered little in the way of details about the size and scope of government spending. \"Should the fiscal stimulus fall short of market expectations, investors could be disappointed,\" warned Qian Wang, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at Vanguard. \"In addition, cyclical policy stimulus does not fix the structural problems,\" Ms Wang noted, suggesting that without deeper reforms the challenges China's economy faces will not go away. Economists see tackling entrenched issues in the real estate market as key to fixing the broader economy. Property is the biggest investment most families will make and falling house prices have helped to undermine consumer confidence. \"Ensuring the delivery of pre-sold but unfinished homes would be key,\" said a note from Sophie Altermatt, an economist with Julius Baer. \"In order to increase domestic consumption on a sustainable basis, fiscal support for household incomes needs to go beyond one-off transfers and rather come through improved pension and social security systems.\"\n\nEvergrande, which was one China's biggest property developers, went into liquidation in January\n\nOn the day of the 75th anniversary, an editorial in the state-controlled newspaper, People's Daily, struck an optimistic tone, recognising that \"while the journey ahead remains challenging, the future is promising\". According to the article, concepts created by President Xi such as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\" are key to unlocking that path to a better future. The emphasis on those ideas reflects Xi's push to switch from the fast drivers of growth in the past, such as property and infrastructure investment, while trying to develop a more balanced economy based on high-end industries. The challenge China faces, according to Ms Ang, is that the \"old and the new economies are deeply intertwined; if the old economy falters too quickly, it will inevitably hinder the rise of the new\". \"This is what the leadership has come to realise and is responding to.\"",
    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nSara Sharif begged her parents for forgiveness for \u201cbeing rude\u201d in a letter discovered after her death, a court has heard. The 10-year-old\u2019s letters and notebook were seized by police after her body was found with dozens of injuries at the family\u2019s home in Woking, Surrey, last year. The court previously heard that Sara had been hooded, burned and beaten during more than two years of abuse. Sara\u2019s father Urfan Sharif, 42, stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder and causing or allowing her death.\n\nOfficers went to the family\u2019s house the day after Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Sara's five brothers and sisters on 9 August 2023. In an undated and misspelled letter to Mr Sharif and Ms Batool shown to jurors, Sara wrote that she was \u201csorry for being rude\u201d and \u201canswering back\u201d. \u201cPlease forgive me. I am so, so sorry,\u201d it said. In a birthday message to her father, Sara wrote: \u201cI love you so much. Thank you for looking after us on the weekends. And making food for us at the weekends. Thank you dad. From Sara. \u201cOur family is the best in town. We spread love all around the world.\u201d Her notebook also contained a short fairy tale about a queen called Beinash and a princess called Sara. Sara also described Ms Batool as the \u201cbest caring and loving mother in the world\u201d in the notebook.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nAt the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Cavanagh also told the jury that they may consider an alternative charge of manslaughter. He said while murder and causing or allowing the death of a child were the charges on the indictment, manslaughter could also be considered if the jury was not certain that murder had been proved. For a conviction on a charge of manslaughter, the jury must be sure that the defendants intended to cause \u201csome physical harm\u201d, he added.\n\nA post-mortem examination found Sara had suffered injuries including \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water before she died on 8 August 2023. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC previously said a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. Under cross-examination, Mr Sharif previously accepted \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Sara's death, but later denied intending to kill her. He also told the jury he was lying when he called his wife, Ms Batool, a \u201cpsycho\u201d earlier in the trial. Mr Sharif admitted beating Sara, but denied biting or burning her.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has tightened the rules on ministers accepting gifts and hospitality, after a row over senior Labour figures receiving freebies. Ministers will not be banned from accepting gifts but the ministerial code has been updated to require them to consider the \"need to maintain the public's confidence in the standards of propriety\" when deciding whether to do so. A register of gifts received by ministers will now also be published monthly, rather than quarterly. Since winning power in July, Sir Keir and other cabinet ministers have faced criticism for accepting gifts from wealthy donors.\n\nLast month, Sir Keir paid back more than \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he had received since becoming prime minister, including tickets to see Taylor Swift, following the backlash. He has also faced scrutiny for receiving thousands of pounds of clothes from Labour peer and donor Lord Alli, who has gifted clothing to a number of ministers as well as the PM's wife. Since then, Downing Street has said Sir Keir, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will no longer accept donations of clothes.\n\nThe updated ministerial code, external states that it is a \"well-established and recognised rule that ministers should not accept any gifts, hospitality or service which would, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence their work in government\". The same principle applies to members of a minister's family. However, it points out that ministers have a responsibility to represent the government and their duties will sometimes require them to attend events where hospitality may be offered. The code adds that it is \"primarily a matter of judgement for ministers who are personally responsible for deciding how to act\" in relation to accepting gifts. The monthly register will include details and the value of gifts worth more than \u00a3140, as well as hospitality, received and given by ministers in their ministerial capacity.\n\nIt comes as the latest list of ministers' interests, external revealed the prime minister is renting out his family home in north London after moving into Downing Street. Sir Keir is not the first prime minister to do so - David Cameron also rented out his family home and Theresa May rented out a flat she owned in central London. The list includes any relevant private interests which could be perceived to give rise to a conflict with a minister's public duties. It will now be published more regularly - quarterly rather than twice a year.\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, will now have the power to launch investigations into alleged breaches of the code without seeking the consent of the prime minister. Previously the PM was able to veto investigations by the adviser. The change was promised in Labour's election manifesto. The ministerial code sets out the standards that ministers are expected to uphold. While Sir Laurie advises the prime minister on adherence to the code, Sir Keir has the final decision on whether there has been a breach and what sanctions, if any, are required. In a foreword to the code, Sir Keir said: \"For a long time, [the British people] have looked at the conduct of politicians in Westminster and not seen the high standards of public service they expect or deserve.\" He added that the updated code \"sets out the higher standards that the British people expect and that ministers must now follow\".",

    "A former British soldier accused of passing secret information to Iran gathered the names of service personnel, including those in special forces, a court has heard.\n\nDaniel Khalife, 23, is separately accused of escaping from Wandsworth Prison last year by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery truck.\n\nHe has gone on trial on charges of collecting sensitive military information for Iran. He denies all the charges.\n\nMr Khalife offered to work for the Iranians for more than 25 years, Woolwich Crown Court was told on Wednesday.\n\nMr Khalife took a photo of a handwritten list of 15 soldiers, including some serving in the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS), the prosecution said.\n\nHe took details from an internal spreadsheet of promotions in June 2021, sent to a WhatsApp group called Brew Room Boys, and then logged on to an internal HR system to find out the soldiers' first names, jurors heard.\n\nMark Heywood KC for the prosecution said: \"He was clearly researching and gathering and recording that information.\"\n\nMr Khalife, who was brought up in Kingston, south-west London by his Iranian-born mother, joined the Army in September 2018, two weeks before his 17th birthday.\n\nIn April 2019, he created a contact with the +98 dialling code for Iran, the court has heard.\n\nBy August 2020, the prosecution said that Mr Khalife was messaging a man saved in his phone as \"David Smith\", describing an internal military system which would identify service personnel.\n\nHe told the contact: \"I won't leave the military until you tell me to\", before adding: \"25+ years.\"\n\nThe prosecution alleged Mr Khalife travelled to Istanbul in August 2020 with the intention of travelling on to Iran for a meeting, but in the end he just remained in the Hilton Istanbul Bomonti Hotel.\n\nAfterwards in an audio message to \u2018David Smith\u2019 he said: \u201cWe were supposed meet actually in your country... We went to Turkey and the plan kind of went sour, they didn\u2019t plan it correctly.\u201d\n\nAt one point in early 2021, Mr Khalife was posted to Fort Hood in Texas in the United States, and the prosecution said he was still in contact with one of his Iranian handlers while he was there.\n\nIt was here where he took a series of screenshots of systems marked \"secret\", including a password record sheet.\n\nIn April that year Mr Khalife was granted the second highest level of Nato security, one below \"cosmic top secret\".\n\nMr Heywood said Mr Khalife was not \"merely a young soldier\" but a \"resourceful man\".\n\nIn his first police interview, conducted in January 2022, Mr Khalife told officers he had an ambition to work in military intelligence or for an elite signals unit.\n\nHe said he had been informed by an officer that his ancestry meant he was unlikely to qualify for the high-level security vetting - called \"Developed Vetting\" - that would allow him to work in sensitive roles.\n\n\u201cAfter this I decided to start my own intel operation to prove that I was able to do this,\u201d he wrote in an electronic note in 2021.\n\n\u201cAll I have ever wanted to do was something in intel.

'You are not my King': Moment King Charles is heckled by Australian politician\n\nWhen an Aboriginal Australian senator heckled King Charles moments after he delivered a speech in the nation\u2019s Parliament House, it caught the world\u2019s attention. Lidia Thorpe\u2019s cries of \u201cnot my King\u201d and \u201cthis is not your land\u201d shone a light on a country that is still grappling with its colonial past. But in the debate that followed on the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of the protest, something else became clear: a split within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community itself. In the wake of an unsuccessful referendum on their constitutional recognition - which left many feeling silenced - the question Australia\u2019s first inhabitants are now grappling with is how to achieve the self-determination they have fought so long for.\n\nIndigenous Australians are classed as the oldest living culture on earth, and have inhabited the continent for at least 65,000 years. For more than 200 years though - since the 1770 arrival of Captain James Cook and subsequent British settlement - they have endured long chapters of colonial violence, including the theft of their lands, livelihoods, and even children. As a result, today, they still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. But, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 4% of the national population, their struggles rarely translate into national voting issues, experts say. Last year\u2019s Voice to Parliament referendum - which asked whether Australia should recognise its first inhabitants in the constitution and allow them a body to advise the parliament - was a key exception. The result was a resounding \u2018No\u2019, with one major analysis of the data suggesting many voters found the proposal divisive and ineffective.\n\nThe Voice to Parliament proposal was decisively rejected in a referendum last year\n\nAnd while the figures indicate a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn\u2019t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading \u2018No\u2019 campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic and \u201can easy way to fake progress\u201d. But Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman and activist, says the \u2018No\u2019 outcome left most Indigenous Australians with \u201ca sense of humiliation and rejection\u201d. She adds that the debate itself - which saw countless examples of misinformation and disinformation - unleashed a wave of \u201cracist rhetoric\u201d that their communities are still recovering from. The big-picture impact of the Voice, Ms Baldwin-Roberts argues, has been a growing sentiment that traditional reconciliation efforts are \u201cdead\u201d. Those approaches have long tried to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through polite dialogue and education. It was against this backdrop that Thorpe made her protest in parliament. \u201cYou can\u2019t reconcile with a country that doesn\u2019t see you,\u201d Ms Baldwin-Roberts tells the BBC. \u201cYou can\u2019t reconcile with a country that doesn\u2019t think that you deserve justice.\u201d Ms Baldwin-Roberts says \u201cnew strategies\u201d are needed to disrupt the status quo. She sees Thorpe\u2019s action as \u201cincredibly brave\u201d and reflective of conversations many First Nations people are having. \u201cThere are Indigenous communities around the country talking about our stolen children, our stolen histories - but she had access to that room. As an Australian senator she knows she\u2019s going to get media, and it\u2019s important to make this a talking point.\u201d\n\nAustralia Day - held on the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet arriving at Sydney Cove - has become an annual target of protests\n\nDaniel Williams, who is of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, agrees. \u201cAfter the [referendum] last year, what do Indigenous people have left? How can we find [an] audience with the monarch to effect change?\u201d he asked a political panel on the ABC. \u201cWe're talking about 200 years of pain that is continuing to be unanswered and unresolved.\u201d Others see it differently though: there is a long history of Indigenous leaders petitioning the Royal Family to recognise their peoples\u2019 struggle, but the independent\u2019s senator\u2019s act - for some - went too far. Nova Peris, a former senator who was the first Aboriginal woman in parliament, described it as an \u201cembarrassing\u201d move which didn\u2019t \u201creflect the manners, or approach to reconciliation, of Aboriginal Australians at large\u201d. Both sides of parliament dismissed it as disrespectful and a failed attempt at grandstanding. Prof Tom Calma, a Kungarakan and Iwaidja man who was in the room, said it risked alienating \u201cthe other 96%\u201d of Australia\u2019s population who may not \u201csee or understand the enduring impacts of colonisation\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think the protest - the way that Senator Thorpe went about it - brings people along with us. And in the spirit of reconciliation, we need allies.\u201d\n\nTom Calma, left, pictured with King Charles on one of his visits to Australia\n\nMr Calma also felt that Thorpe\u2019s demand that King Charles \u201cgive [Indigenous people] a treaty\u201d was misplaced, given that those negotiations would be handled by Australia\u2019s government, not the Crown. As it stands, Australia is one of the only Commonwealth countries to have never signed a treaty, or treaties, with its first inhabitants, or to have recognised them in its founding document. And with a general election expected before mid-next year, both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly from the Voice debate, leaving much uncertainty over future policy. For Ms Baldwin-Roberts, this week\u2019s juxtaposition between the crowds of royal supporters decked out in regalia, and those engaging in protest nearby, reflects \u201ca large separation and social reality between Australia\u2019s Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations\u201d that exists today. And in order to bridge that gap, she believes \u201cthere has to be some level of reckoning\u201d. \u201cWe live in different spaces, it\u2019s still a largely separated nation. So where do we go from here?\u201d",

    "'How Hatton's win may be key to ending golf's paralysis'\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (left), DP World Tour chief Guy Kinnings (centre) and PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan (right) were all at last week's Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland\n\nWith a freshly unveiled statue of Old Tom Morris looking down on golf\u2019s most famous green, the game\u2019s ancient and spiritual home might just have borne witness to significant developments in a troubled sport. Certainly, the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, which concluded on St Andrews\u2019 Old Course last Sunday with victory for LIV player Tyrrell Hatton, provided pause for thought about how Europe\u2019s leading tour might approach an uncertain future. In a current state of paralysis, golf seeks to end a greedy civil war. It is a mess compounded by the DP World Tour\u2019s 'strategic alliance' with the PGA Tour. The deal, which nominally runs until 2035 and secured the Wentworth circuit financially, also lopsidedly favours the Americans. They boss the calendar and cherry pick Europe\u2019s top talent. For the past few years, the European tour has been left to shoe-horn its biggest tournaments into the back end of an exhausting season, and only after the PGA\u2019s precious play-offs have been concluded in August.\n\nInitially, there seemed a potential upside for Europe, but it has not properly materialised. Hopes that the US circuit\u2019s bigger names would venture to this side of the pond to add stardust to events such as the Dunhill and BMW PGA, as well as the Irish and French Opens, have proven unfounded. While DP World Tour loyalist Billy Horschel came and conquered at Wentworth for the second time last month, he is a rare exception. We see precious little American enthusiasm from any of their other big names. Yes, there were massive crowds for the recent PGA, but they did not turn up to see Peter Malnati and Mark Hubbard - the next two most prominent US golfers to dig out dusty passports. By contrast, last week\u2019s Dunhill and the invitations of its powerful tournament boss, South African Johan Rupert, imported a bucketload of stardust from the rival LIV tour. Among the 14 LIV golfers who took part in this glorified pro-am, where early rounds are also played at Carnoustie and Kingsbarns, were former world number one and Masters champion Jon Rahm, five times major winner Brooks Koepka and 2018 Augusta victor Patrick Reed. This is the sort of star-power craved by the DP World Tour to supplement the likes of Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Fitzpatrick, who offer crucial support to the European circuit at this time of year. Rupert also engineered it so that PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan competed and played together as amateurs. DP World Tour boss Guy Kinnings was also present. So there was plenty of scope for developing ongoing talks to bring further Saudi investment into golf and potentially agree a more harmonious future. Kinnings\u2019 position in all of this was, surely, bolstered by the quality of the pro field. Imagine this scenario developing; LIV stars - including US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau - routinely playing DP World Tour events and picking up the sort of world ranking points that have now returned Hatton to the world\u2019s top 20. How about, in return, Saudi investment pouring into Wentworth? The appeals by Hatton, Rahm and Adrian Meronk against fines for playing LIV events without releases could be quietly dropped. Some might recoil at strengthening ties with Saudi Arabia but the European tour has never had a problem with doing deals with the Kingdom, despite its controversial reputation on human rights. Money talks: \"Pinch your noses chaps, we\u2019re going in. This is too good to refuse.\" Like it or not, morality takes a back seat when cash becomes the driver. It is why splashing it for 'sportswashing' purposes, according to some critics, seems so worthwhile to the Saudis. For Kinnings\u2019 tour there is a future, if they can buy their way out of the strategic alliance, that potentially involves more money, more big name players and probably more sponsorship. McIlroy said last week that he finds European tour events \"more authentic and not as corporate\" as in the US, adding that the \"crowds at the Irish Open and Wentworth, compared to the three FedEx Cup play-off events, were bigger and the atmosphere better\". The European tour could return to being a rival to rather than a partner of the PGA Tour, especially if the current stodgy negotiations continue to falter, or the deal fails to pass the scrutiny of the US Department of Justice. \"It would maybe bring the European tour back to like the '80s and '90s when there was two strong tours,\u201d said McIlroy, when I recently asked him about the prospect of a breakaway Saudi deal with the continental circuit. \"But it keeps the game divided and I don't like that. You know, I really want the game to come back together. It would be Plan B. It would be maybe an alternative to the best solution.\" McIlroy\u2019s vision is for the game to come together with a global calendar that benefits everyone. He told BBC Northern Ireland last week that he would like to see it done by the end of the year. It is now 17 months since the shock announcement of a 'framework agreement' that was prematurely portrayed as a merger between the PGA and DP World Tours and LIV. Very little has emerged, other than the formation of the for-profit umbrella PGA Tour Enterprises company that has $1.5bn (\u00a31.15bn) of funding from the US-based sports venture capitalist Strategic Sports Group. It is thought SSG want a Saudi deal done quickly. That could also suit the PIF and LIV players, who are wondering what the long term future holds for their circuit. The DP World Tour is increasingly keen to know the outlook of the men\u2019s pro game. But is there the same urgency for the PGA Tour? They have lucrative TV contracts secured for the rest of the decade, sponsors in place and seemingly unwavering support from their season-long backer, FedEx. Might they just want to play for time, see how LIV reacts as contracts with several of their initial crop of players begin to expire? Will the Saudis continue to send massive oil soaked cheques to pick off top PGA Tour players? Who knows? Monahan, and influential board members such as Patrick Cantlay and Tiger Woods, might want to wait and see. This could further frustrate the fragile peace process aimed at ending an increasingly tedious stand off. But the Dunhill showed there is a potential alternative path for the DP World Tour that, at the very least, provides Kinnings with some leverage to give Monahan and co the hurry up. Back in the 19th century, Old Tom was golf\u2019s most important pioneer. He helped make St Andrews the undisputed 'home of golf' but Morris Snr's influence was felt far and wide. He truly - to use the LIV buzz phrase - \"grew the game\". Maybe, just maybe, the arrival of his long-awaited statue has coincided with the next significant steps to be taken by his sport.",

Capes, who was born in Lincolnshire, was also a six-time champion at the World Highland Games. His victories in the prestigious World's Strongest Man event, which made him a household name, came in 1983 in Christchurch, New Zealand and 1985 in Cascais, Portugal. Fellow World's Strongest Man winner Eddie Hall, who won in 2017, paid tribute to Capes by saying he was a \"true legend of strength\". \"Not only was Geoff a two-time World's Strongest Man and a record-breaking shot putter, but he was also a giant in heart and spirit,\" said Hall. \"He paved the way for athletes like me, showing that British grit and determination could conquer the world. \"Geoff was an inspiration to so many of us growing up, a man whose incredible achievements and character left a lasting mark on the strength community. \"His legacy will continue to inspire the next generation of strongmen and athletes around the world. \"Rest easy, big man. You'll always be remembered as one of the greatest.\"\n\nGeoff Capes won six titles at the World Highland Games, making him the most successful competitor in the history of the event\n\nAccording to the Geoff Capes Foundation website, Capes was 6ft 5.5in tall and weighed 170kg in his physical prime. Following his retirement from competition Capes took up coaching and helped many aspiring athletes, as well as appearing on two reality television shows. Britain's Carl Myerscough threw longer than Capes' shot put record with a distance of 21.92m in Sacramento, United States, but that 2003 result was not ratified. In later life, Capes lived in the Lincolnshire village of Stoke Rochford. He had two children as well as grandchildren. Capes served as a policeman for 10 years in Cambridgeshire, earning \u00a39.50 a week. He resigned before the 1980 Olympics in Moscow after \"political pressure\" to boycott the Games following Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. \"Russia invaded Afghanistan, and Margaret Thatcher banned all the services from going \u2013 army and police \u2013 because they paid their wages,\" Capes told the told the Telegraph, external last year. \"So I resigned from the police just before the Olympics. I lost my career, lost my pension, lost my income. They had total control over you.\" Capes was famously a budgerigar enthusiast and in 2008 he served a year as president of the Budgerigar Society. In a statement following news of his death, British Athletics said: \"British Athletics are saddened to hear the news of former British shot putter, Geoff Capes' passing. \"Our condolences go out to his family and friends at this time.\" Team GB said it is \"deeply saddened\" by Capes' passing. Tessa Sanderson, the Olympic javelin champion in 1984, said Capes was a \"great person and a giant of an athlete\", while reigning British shot put champion Scott Lincoln said he was the man who put the sport \"on the map in the UK\". He added on Instagram: \"An icon, hero, legend, role model, friend and all round good guy. Will be sorely missed by not only me but so many around the athletics community.\" World Athletics president Lord Coe said: \"Geoff's passing is a sad moment for so many of us in both British and global athletics. \"He was a huge figure in British athletics and brought the crowds back to our sport. Fiercely independent, competitive, but always protective of the teams that he captained with distinction.\"\n\nGeoff Capes set a world record in truck pulling in August 1983 at the Crystal Palace Sports Centre, London",

    "'Jeremy Clarkson didn't know much, now he looks like a farmer'\n\nDilwyn Evans - pictured with Jeremy Clarkson and farm manager Kaleb Cooper - helps look after the animals of Diddly Squat\n\nClarkson\u2019s Farm vet Dilwyn Evans has said that Jeremy Clarkson has \"learned a lot\" through the course of the series. \"He didn't know a lot at the beginning but now he knows how animals behave. He looks more like a farmer during the course of the programme,\" he said. Clarkson\u2019s Farm debuted on Prime Video in June 2021, and follows the former Top Gear presenter's attempt to run Diddly Squat, a 1,000-acre farm near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. Dilwyn, 62, from Llanddewi Brefi, Ceredigion, was recommended to Clarkson by his neighbour and has helped look after the farm\u2019s animals since the show launched.\n\n\"Sometimes you think he's joking but his questions are completely genuine \u2013 you have to tell him what's what and that's how he learns,\" he told Bore Sul on BBC Radio Cymru. He is now retired and devotes much of his time to helping Clarkson get to grips with Diddly Squat.\n\n\"Jeremy has learned a lot during the programme. The work is on a different scale to being a vet but the phone may go off at any time asking for help,\" he said. \"I believe I have been very lucky - I was in the right place at the right time.\"\n\nDilwyn said Clarkson\u2019s Farm had \"conveyed how difficult farming is\". \"Farmers get a lot of stick, with some believing that the life of a farmer is all about driving four-wheel drives, going shooting every other day and fox hunting,\" he added. \"But it's not like that. Farming is hard - you have to rely on the weather, that the animals are going to be fine and market prices. \"You can grow exactly the same product as last year but this year the price can be considerably lower. \"Clarkson's Farm shows that things don't always go to plan - it's not Jeremy Clarkson's fault but that's the way it goes and one can be unlucky.\"\n\nClarkson's Farm spans three seasons on Amazon Prime, with a fourth on the way\n\nAlthough Dilwyn eventually trained as a vet, farming has long been a part of his life \u2013 he grew up as one of four children on a 67-acre farm. \"In the early days we only had 15 milking cows and one or two sows. \"Things were tight. My parents never had a holiday and we only used to go away for a day trip - to the Royal Welsh, for example. We milked the cows before and after our trip. \"There wasn't enough money for us all to go on a school trip - we took turns.\"\n\nDilwyn studied veterinary medicine at Edinburgh and his inspiration came from another popular TV programme. \"Seeing All Creatures Great and Small as a child encouraged me to be a vet and I saw myself as a James Herriot,\" he said. \"I also liked school work and mum, in particular, pushed us a lot to do school work. \"'Nobody will be able to take your academic achievements away from you', she said but it was difficult to get a place to be a vet and you had to get three As. \"All four of us left home - it was almost a shame that no-one took over the farm.\"",

The remains of Lois and John McCullough, aged 71 and 70, were found in sleeping bags at their house in Great Baddow, Essex, in September 2023. Virginia McCullough, 36, admitted fatally poisoning her father - and placing him in a \"homemade mausoleum\" - and stabbing her mother to death in June 2019. The defendant, who told police \"cheer up, at least you've caught the bad guy\", will have to serve a minimum term of 36 years before being considered for release.\n\nThe bodies of Lois and John McCullough were hidden in different parts of their house, concealed in sleeping bags\n\nShe ran up large debts on credit cards in her parents' names and after their deaths she continued to spend their pensions. Essex Police said documents at the couple's home \"built a picture of a woman who was trying desperately to keep her parents from discovering the depth of the financial black hole she continued to dig, while giving them false assurances about her employment and future prospects\". McCullough, who previously admitted two counts of murder, was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court but she showed no emotion as she was sent down. Det Supt Rob Kirby, head of major crime at Essex Police, said the case had \"shocked and horrified\" even the force's most experienced murder detectives. He said McCullough had created a web of lies \"on a shocking and monumental scale\" and described her as \"an intelligent and adept manipulator\". A missing persons' investigation was launched in September 2023 after Mr and Mrs McCullough's GP raised concerns about not hearing from them. Police became suspicious of the couple's daughter due to her constant excuses for her parents whereabouts and later executed a warrant at the family home.\n\u2022 None As it happened: BBC reporting live from Chelmsford Crown Court sentencing Bodyworn footage showed McCullough admit the murders to arresting officers and told them: \"Cheer up, at least you've caught the bad guy\". She confessed to police how she created a \"cocktail of drugs\" to poison her parents on 17 June 2019 - days after using her father as a \"guinea pig\" to test the concoction. McCullough poisoned her father with prescription medication that she crushed and put into his alcoholic drinks, prosecutor Lisa Wilding KC said. The effects were fatal for Mr McCullough, but Mrs McCullough was given a weaker dose and was merely sedated.\n\nVirginia McCullough lived alongside her parents' bodies for four years\n\nMcCullough then beat her mother with a hammer and stabbed her multiple times in the chest with a kitchen knife as she listened to the radio in bed the following morning. She had decided to murder her mother out of fear she might find out what happened to Mr McCullough. The court heard how Mr McCullough's body had been stashed away in a \"homemade mausoleum\" of masonry blocks in his study. Mrs McCullough's body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag in an upstairs wardrobe.\n\nJohn McCullough's body was concealed in a makeshift tomb constructed in his office downstairs\n\nMcCullough told police: \"When I was hitting her it was like someone badly playing the xylophone, it was willy-nilly.\" Following the murders, the defendant went into Chelmsford city centre and purchased plastic gloves and sleeping bags on her father's bank card. Having concealed the bodies, McCullough would go on to persistently lie about her parents' whereabouts, cancel family arrangements and tell doctors and friends her parents they were unwell or on holiday, Ms Wilding said. \"Covid restrictions were a stroke of luck for this defendant in pursuing the deception that her parents were still alive,\" the prosecutor added.\n\nThe court heard McCullough benefited from \u00a3149,697 as a result of murdering her parents - combined from their pensions and spending on their credit cards, as well as selling assets. \"The money appears to have been frittered away and not spent on expensive or lavish items,\" Ms Wilding said, including \u00a321,000 on online gambling between 2019 and 2023. Richard Butcher, brother of Lois McCullough, said in a victim impact statement that his niece was \"very dangerous\" and that what had happened had \"undermined my faith in humanity\".\n\nLois and John McCullough were duped by their daughter, who sold them dreams about her future prospects\n\nMr Justice Jeremy Johnson, sentencing, said to McCullough: \"You think more of money than you do of humanity. \"Your parents were entitled to feel safe in their own beds and their own home, and they were entitled to feel safe with their daughter. \"You, nevertheless, made a full, conscious and deliberate decision to murder each of your parents.\"\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Essex?",

The 31-year-old's future remains uncertain, despite extending his all-time scoring record to 69 goals in 103 appearances for his country when he scored the opener in the 5-0 win against the Republic of Ireland on Sunday. England interim manager Lee Carsley benched Kane for the 3-0 victory in Greece on Thursday, while he was criticised for his performances at Euro 2024. But when asked if the next World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, would be his last shot at glory with England, the Bayern Munich striker told PA: \"I don't think so. \"I think there's a perception when you get to your 30s that you're coming to an end, but for me I'm performing at the highest level I've ever performed and feel as good as I've ever felt, so it's about taking in the moment.\n\n\"I don't like to look too far ahead and in my career, I never have, the [2026] World Cup is going to be exciting. \"In America it will be an incredible occasion and ultimately it's about trying to win that, looking at where you are, where to improve and it will be no different in a couple of years.\" Kane was speaking at the unveiling of a statue and a mural of him at the Peter May Sports Centre in east London, where he began playing as a five-year-old for Ridgeway Rovers. \"It's pretty special to be honest,\" Kane told BBC Newsround. \"I played on these pitches as a five-year-old with dreams of playing for England, and I've been lucky enough to achieve that. \"Hopefully the boys and girls will walk past and be inspired by the story of my journey, my life and hard work.\" When asked what it would take to get a statue of him at Wembley Stadium, he added: \"I think we need to win a major tournament.\" England will look to do that under Thomas Tuchel, who will begin his 18-month contract as manager on 1 January after Carsley's temporary spell. Kane played under Tuchel at Bayern last season and is confident the German can end the Three Lions' trophy drought. \"He's a fantastic coach and a really good guy as well,\" he said. \"I'm excited to work with him again. \"I know he'll bring bundles of energy, and come March we'll be focused on America and the World Cup, and that's an exciting prospect to look forward to.\" England will find out their World Cup qualifying opponents on 13 December, with the first games scheduled to take place in March.\n\nHarry Kane scored his 69th goal for England in 103 appearances against the Republic of Ireland",
    "The Royal Family has received millions of pounds of income in rent from the NHS, schools and the armed forces, a new documentary has revealed. In the investigation by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches and the Sunday Times, external, it is reported that the private estates of King Charles and Prince William hold contracts with public bodies and charities. Dame Margaret Hodge told the BBC on Sunday the findings have raised \"serious question marks\" and has called for a \"full and transparent review\" of both duchies. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of King Charles, said it \"complies with all relevant UK legislation and regulatory standards applicable to its range of business activities\".\n\nOver the past year, deals made by the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall have raised around \u00a350 million, it has been claimed. The Duchy of Lancaster, established in 1399, and Prince William's Duchy of Cornwall, established in 1337, both hold large amounts of land and commercial property in England and Wales. Their contracts with public bodies are said to include a \u00a337.5 million agreement between the Duchy of Cornwall and the Ministry of Justice to lease Dartmoor Prison, and a \u00a311.4 million deal between Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust and the Duchy of Lancaster to rent a London warehouse over 15 years to store ambulances. The estates also reportedly charge the Ministry of Defence for access to moor boats and refuel warships, some state schools to use their properties, and a local borough council to operate a toll bridge. The estates are not subject to corporation tax and the royals do not pay capital gains tax on the assets they sell. They voluntarily pay income tax on the surplus. The programme, Dispatches\u2019 The King, The Prince and Their Secret Millions, reports that details of the rental agreements have not been given to Parliament. The report points out that the duchies say they are not funded by taxpayers, but they do receive income from public services. The documentary raises concerns about the environmental impact of some of the estates' contracts, including those with mining companies.\n\nThe two private estates are separate to the Crown Estate. Profits from the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury. The level of profit made by the Crown Estate is used as a benchmark to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family in the form of the Sovereign Grant. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant will rise to \u00a3132 million in the next financial year, after profits from the Crown Estate increased to \u00a31.1 billion. Dame Hodge, a former chair of the Public Accounts Committee said: \"We all love the monarchy, we all want it to work. But we want them to lead by example in the way they conduct their finances. \"They don\u2019t pay capital gains tax and they don't pay corporation tax, yet they claim to act commercially,\" she said. \"But they can\u2019t have it both ways. If they want to be private and commercial they have to pay the fair rate of tax as everyone else does, otherwise they get a competitive advantage\". A Duchy of Cornwall spokesperson said it is \"a private estate with a commercial imperative which we achieve alongside our commitment to restoring the natural environment and generating positive social impact for our communities\". On the issue of mining, the spokesperson said that the duchy was \u201cacting responsibly and in a sustainable way\u201d in line with the government\u2019s industrial strategy, which encourages investment in domestic sources of minerals. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said it operates \"as a commercial company, managing a broad range of land and property assets across England and Wales\". They said that the duchy \"delegates certain functions, particularly those regarding asset management, to the Duchy Council\" and while the King \"takes a close interest\" in the work of the duchy, day-to-day management of the portfolio is the responsibility of the council and executive team. It added it had made \"a number of key environmental improvements in recent years\".\n\u2022 None Royals to get extra \u00a345m as Crown Estate profits soar",
    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Starship rocket has completed a world first after part of it was captured on its return to the launch pad. The SpaceX vehicle's lower half manoeuvred back beside its launch tower where it was caught in a giant pair of mechanical arms, as part of its fifth test flight. It brings SpaceX\u2019s ambition of developing a fully reusable and rapidly deployable rocket a big step closer. \"A day for the history books,\" engineers at SpaceX declared as the booster landed safely.\n\nThe chances of the bottom part of the rocket, known as the Super Heavy booster, being caught so cleanly on the first attempt seemed slim. Prior to the launch, the SpaceX team said it would not be surprised if the booster was instead directed to land in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSpaceX can now point to some extraordinary achievements in the past two test flights. This comes only eighteen months after its inaugural flight, which saw the vehicle blown apart not long after launch. SpaceX argues that these failures are also part of its development plan - to launch early in the expectation of failure so that it can collect as much data as possible and develop its systems quicker than its rivals. The initial stages of the ascent of the fifth test were the same as the previous outing, with the Ship and booster separating two and three-quarter minutes after leaving the ground. At this point the booster began to head back towards the launch site at Boca Chica in Texas. With just two minutes to go till landing it was still not clear if the attempt would be made, as final checks were carried out by the team operating the tower.\n\nStarship blasted out of the Earth's atmosphere before the booster separated\n\nWhen the flight director gave the go-ahead, cheers went up from SpaceX employees at mission control. The company had said that thousands of criteria had to be met for the attempt to be made. As the Super Heavy booster re-entered the atmosphere it slowed down from speeds in excess of a few thousands miles per hour. When it approached the landing tower, which stands 146m-high (480ft), its raptor engines worked to control its landing. It seemed to almost float, orange flames engulfed the booster and it deftly slotted into the giant mechanical arms.\n\nStarship lifted off from its launchpad in Texas for its fifth test flight at sunrise local time\n\nThe Ship part of the rocket, which is where equipment and crew will eventually be held for future missions, fired up its own engines after separating from the booster. It was successfully landed in the Indian Ocean around forty minutes later. \"Ship landed precisely on target! Second of the two objectives achieved\", SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. Not only was the Ship landed accurately but SpaceX also managed to preserve some of the vehicle's hardware, which it had not expected.\n\nThe mechanical chopsticks of the launch tower are used to lift Starship's parts into position\n\nCatching the booster rather than getting it to land on the launch pad reduces the need for complex hardware on the ground and will enable rapid redeployment of the vehicle in the future. Elon Musk and SpaceX have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making our species \"multi-planetary\". The US space agency, Nasa, will also be delighted the flight has gone to plan. It has paid the company $2.8bn (\u00a32.14bn) to develop Starship into a lander capable of returning astronauts to the Moon's surface by 2026. In space terms that is not that far away so Elon Musk's team were eager to get the rocket re-launched as soon as possible. But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) , the US government body that approves all flights, had previously said there would be no launch before November as it reviewed the company's permits. Since last month the agency and Elon Musk have been in a public spat after the FAA said it was seeking to fine his company, SpaceX, $633,000 for allegedly failing to follow its license conditions and not getting permits for previous flights. Before issuing a license, the FAA reviews the impact of the flight, in particular the effect on the environment. In response to the fine, Musk threatened to sue the agency and SpaceX put out a public blog post, external hitting back against \"false reporting\" that part of the rocket was polluting the environment. Currently the FAA only considers the impact on the immediate environment from rocket launches rather than the wider impacts of the emissions. Dr Eloise Marais, professor of atmospheric chemistry and air quality at University College London, said the carbon emissions from rockets pale in comparison to other forms of transport but there are other planet-warming pollutants which are not being considered. \"The black carbon is one of the biggest concerns. The Starship rocket is using liquid methane. It's a relatively new propellant, and we don't have very good data of the amount of emissions that are coming from liquid methane,\" she said. Dr Marais said what makes black carbon from rockets so concerning is that they release it hundreds of miles higher into the atmosphere than planes, where it can last much longer.",
    "Tesco row shows Sundays are still sacred on Hebridean islands\n\nA small protest was held outside Tesco in Stornoway when it opened for the first time on a Sunday at 12:00\n\nIslanders on Lewis spend their Sundays in a way the rest of Scotland - and the UK - have not seen in decades. Swimming pools and sports centres are closed and most businesses are shut. Like the rest of the Western Isles there is no public transport on Sundays. There is a strong tradition of Christian church-going on Lewis - and neighbouring Harris - with the Church of Scotland and Free Church predominant. According to the latest Census figures, Church of Scotland (35.3%) was the most common religious group in the Western Isles. But a row over the seven-day opening of a Tesco in Stornoway, Lewis, has brought this traditional way of life into focus.\n\nAnd when the first customers filed into the store after 12:00 on Sunday it marked a historical change. They were greeted by a small protest but shoppers gave their backing to the move.\n\nFiona Macdonald is among islanders who approve of the Sunday opening\n\nDomick Heward told BBC News: \"I really don't mind at all. \"It means if I have forgot to get something during the week I can just get it on my day off.\" Morag Macbeth described the development as \"absolutely brilliant\". She added: \"We have to move with the times.\" Josh Nelson said the Sunday opening was \"much needed\". And Fiona Macdonald said the island was \"into the 21st century at last\". She said: \"If it is ok for the pubs to be open, restaurants, Chinese, why not a supermarket? \"I am a Christian and, yes, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, but going into a shop for a tube of toothpaste I don\u2019t think is a great sin.\"\n\u2022 None 7,280Population of Stornoway, the largest town in the Western Isles\n\u2022 None 160Miles of islands make up the Western Isles - other islands include North and South Uist, Barra and Benbecula\n\nFaithful observance of the Sabbath, or Lord's Day, is embedded in the culture of Lewis and Harris. According the Bible's Ten Commandments, the Sabbath is a spiritual time for worship and rest from work and play. In the past, islanders didn't hang washing outside as a mark of respect for the Sabbath - and on occasions some church-goers even chained up children's swings to help ensure peace and quiet. Dr James Eglinton is a a senior lecturer in Reformed Theology at Edinburgh University and has family from Lewis. He said chaining swings had become a trope used by people who don't understand island culture. Dr Eglinton added: \"It's very much projected on to that culture and that kind of stuff makes the Sabbath sound very dour, killjoy and weird. \"What you have on Lewis is a living example of a local culture that practices a day of rest as a community. \"On mainland Scotland people think that's quite odd, but it's a normal thing across continental Europe.\"\n\nThe Rev Hector Morrison, who is from Lewis and is principal of Highland Theological College UHI, said one reason for the longevity of Lewis and Harris' Sunday traditions were evangelical revivals. These were events when communities felt committed to a very pious way of Christianity. The Rev Morrison says parts of Lewis and Harris experienced revivals every 10-15 years up until at least the 1970s. He has fond memories of growing up in Lewis and says the Sabbath never seemed dour. The former minister adds: \"I believe that Sunday will remain special for Lewis and Harris people not primarily because it is so deeply embedded in the island\u2019s culture, but as long as the gospel itself remains significant and powerfully at work in these islands. \"Each new generation which comes to love the Lord, will want to keep the Lord\u2019s commandments.\"\n\nWomen walk to church in the Hebrides in the 1950s\n\nOther religions across the Western isles include Catholic, particularly in the southern isles including Barra, and there is a mosque in Stornoway. For Lewis and Harris the last 20 years have seen significant changes to Sundays. Hotels' restaurants have opened and there is a petrol station with a shop trading on Sundays. The island's first commercial flights started in October 2002. About 60 campaigners gathered to meet the plane when it landed at Stornoway. They stood in quiet protest and handed out leaflets saying travelling on the Sabbath was a sin and damaging to a person's soul and island life. A young oil industry worker was among the passengers on that first flight. He told the BBC at the time a Sunday air service offered him a chance to balance working away from home and getting back to spend quality time with his family. Seven years later the first ferry - a lifeline form of transport in the Western Isles - sailed from Stornoway to mainland Scotland on a Sunday. A small group prayed and sang a psalm as cars boarded the boat, but several hundred other people stood and clapped as a show of support for the sailing.\n\nAmong the protestors was Govan-born Free Church minister Rev Angus Smith. He led a demonstration against Skye Sunday ferries in 1965 and was removed by police after sitting in front of cars waiting to board. Then in 2018, a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi marked the first time a cinema was open on a Sunday in Lewis. There was a small protest outside. Lewis-based BBC journalist Donald Lamont said the debate was not a simple one. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: \"It's not as straight forward as those of a religious persuasion versus those who are not. It's more nuanced than that. \"There are a lot of people expressing sadness, a lot of people are ambivalent and there are those who are pleased with the news.\"",
    "Meta has been fined \u20ac798m (\u00a3664m) for breaking competition law by embedding Facebook Marketplace within its social network. The European Commission said this meant alternative classified ads services had faced \"unfair trading conditions\", making it harder for them to compete. In addition to the fine, it has ordered Meta to stop imposing these conditions on other services. Meta said it rejected the Commission's findings and would appeal. EU antitrust head Margrethe Vestager said Facebook had impeded other online classified ads service providers. \"It did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\" she added, She said Meta \"must stop this behaviour\", with the EU asking the firm to \"refrain from repeating\" the infringement. Meta said the Commission had provided \"no evidence\" of harm either to competitors or consumers. \"This decision ignores the market realities, and will only serve to protect incumbent marketplaces from competition.\" The ruling is the result of an investigation which the Commission opened in 2021, after Meta's rivals complained that Facebook Marketplace gave it an unfair advantage.\n\nMeta has not previously faced a fine from the EU over competition rules - though it was told to pay \u20ac110m in 2017 for not handing over correct information when it purchased WhatsApp. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has also previously fined Meta more than \u20ac1bn over mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the United States.

Six different bonfire societies are holding processions through the East Sussex town and spectators will watch as huge effigies are paraded through the streets. Previous effigies include former Prime Ministers Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson, as well as other politicians including current American President Joe Biden.

The event is the result of the combined work of seven bonfire societies, most of which date back to the 19th Century. Each society is located in a different part of town, centred around its own pub, which doubles as an HQ. Six societies are taking part this year, according to Lewes District Council. Two of the societies, Lewes Borough Bonfire Society and Cliffe Bonfire Society, date back to 1853 \u2013 but the celebrations are said to have been going on for many years before that.\n\nAn effigy of Guy Fawkes is always paraded through the town\n\nParticipants also carry burning barrels and 17 burning crosses. These hark back to the 17 Protestant martyrs who were burnt in Lewes during the reign of Bloody Mary, half a century before Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Lewes Bonfire is also well-known for its effigies of politicians and celebrities, including FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Donald Trump when he was US President.

The BBC has learnt that Hamas - sensing an opportunity to regain its faltering control - has reactivated a special security force to combat theft and banditry.\n\nAfter gangsters robbed nearly 100 UN lorries, injuring many of the Palestinian drivers, on 16 November - one of the worst single losses of aid during the war - a number of alleged looters were then killed in an ambush. A notorious Gazan criminal family then blocked the main Salah al-Din Road leading from Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing point for two days last week. Witnesses said iron barriers were erected and lorries trying to access the aid distribution point were fired at. \u201cLaw and order have broken down in the area around the Kerem Shalom crossing, which remains the main entry point of goods, and gangs are filling the power vacuum,\u201d says Sam Rose, deputy director of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in Gaza.\n\nHeavy rains and high waves have flooded tented camps for displaced Palestinians across Gaza, including Deir al-Balah\n\nAs the rainy winter weather begins, humanitarian officials say solving the worsening situation is critical to meet the huge, deepening needs of most of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population - now displaced to the centre and south. \u201cIt is tactical, systematic, criminal looting,\u201d says Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN\u2019s humanitarian office, Ocha, in Gaza. He says this is leading to \u201cultra-violence\u201d in all directions - \u201cfrom the looters towards the truckers, from the IDF towards the police, and from the police towards the looters\u201d. There has been increased lawlessness in Gaza since Israel began targeting police officers early this year, citing their role in Hamas governance. \u201cHamas\u2019s security control dropped to under 20%,\u201d the former head of Hamas police investigations told the BBC, adding: \u201cWe are working on a plan to restore control to 60% within a month.\u201d Some displaced Gazans in the south welcome the new Hamas efforts against criminal gangs. \u201cKilling the thieves who stole aid is a step in the right direction,\u201d exclaims one man, Mohammed Abu Jared. However, others see them as a cynical attempt to take control of lucrative black markets. \u201cHamas is killing its competitors in stealing aid,\u201d says Mohammed Diab, an activist in Deir al-Balah. \u201cA big mafia has finished off a small mafia.\u201d\n\nAid agencies say there has been a stark increase in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza\n\nMany see Hamas\u2019s attempts to take a lead against the criminality as the direct consequence of Israels\u2019 failure to agree on a post-war plan in Gaza. There are currently no alternatives to replace the Islamist movement and armed group which Israeli leaders pledged to destroy after last year\u2019s deadly 7 October attacks. The chaos comes at a time when aid entering the Palestinian territory has dropped to some of the lowest levels since the start of the war. While the threat of famine is greatest in besieged parts of the north where Israel is conducting a new, intense military offensive, in the south there are also major shortages of food, medicines and other goods. \u201cPrices of basic commodities are sky-rocketing - a bag of flour costs more than $200 (\u00a3160), a single egg $15 - or else goods are simply not available,\u201d Sam Rose of Unrwa says. Every day in the past week, Umm Ahmed has stood with her children in a huge queue outside a bakery in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where ultimately some loaves are given out. \u201cMy children are very hungry every day. We can\u2019t afford the basics. It\u2019s constant suffering. No food, no water, no cleaning products, nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want much, just to live a decent life. We need food. We need goods to come in and be distributed fairly. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking for.\u201d\n\nUmm Ahmed says her children are going hungry every day\n\nThe US has been pressing for Israel to allow more aid lorries into Gaza. However, Israeli officials say that the main reason that their goal of 350 a day has not been reached is the inability of the UN and other international aid agencies to bring enough lorries to the crossings. Aid workers reject that. They are urgently calling for many entry restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities to be lifted, and for more crossing points to be opened and secured so they can collect and distribute supplies. They say the breakdown in public order needs to be addressed and that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide protection and security. The BBC was told that thefts often happen in clear sight of Israeli soldiers or surveillance drones - but that the army fails to intervene. Stolen goods are apparently being stored outside or in warehouses in areas under Israeli military control. The IDF did not respond to BBC requests for comment on how it combats organised looting and smuggling. It has previously insisted that it takes countermeasures and works to facilitate the entry of aid.\n\nIsrael is reportedly studying the option of using a private contractor to deliver aid\n\nEarly in the war, as food became increasingly scarce, desperate Gazans were sometimes seen stealing from incoming aid lorries. Soon, cigarette smuggling became a huge business with gangs holding up convoys at gunpoint after they arrived from Egypt\u2019s Rafah crossing and, after this shut in May, Kerem Shalom. A cigarette packet can sell for exorbitant amounts in Gaza: while a packet of 20 cost about 20 shekels ($5.40) before the war, now a single cigarette can cost 180 shekels ($48.60). Cigarettes are being found within the frames of wooden aid pallets and inside closed food cans, indicating that there is a regional racket involved in smuggling. For the past six weeks, the Israeli authorities have banned commercial imports, arguing that these benefit Hamas. This has added to the decrease in the supply of food, which is in turn driving the rise in armed looting. Stolen goods, from flour to winter shelters, sent as international donations and meant to be given as free handouts to needy people can only be bought at extortionate prices on Gaza\u2019s black market. Meanwhile, months\u2019 worth of donated supplies are being held back in Egypt due to hold-ups in aid delivery. In recent days, local media reports are suggesting that Israel is now studying the option of delivering aid to Gaza by means of a private, armed American security contractor. While nothing has yet been officially announced, aid workers are worried. Georgios Petropoulos of Ocha questions which donor countries would want supplies distributed this way. \u201cHow safe is it really going to be?\u201d he asks: \u201cI think it will be a vector for more bloodshed and violence.\u201d",

At the time of the incident, Mr Kaba was unarmed. \"Gun cop cleared\" is the headline in the Daily Mirror, external. \"Cleared in three hours\", says the Sun, external, which highlights what it calls the \"police's fury\" at the murder trial. The Daily Telegraph, external says the Crown Prosecution Service is \"under fire\" from both Scotland Yard and MPs, who are asking why Martyn Blake was charged in the first place. The Times, external says there is \"anger on all sides\", with a police source telling the paper that, if prosecutors are \"trying to make an example of someone\", no one will want to work as a firearms officer. In its leader column, the Financial Times gives its verdict on the government's assessment that its overhaul of workers' rights will cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year. The paper insists that the government's tax plans \"must avoid overburdening business and investors\" and calls on the chancellor to \"tread carefully\". In the Daily Mail, external, shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake writes that what he calls the \"draconian\" bill is \"a catastrophic own goal\" and \"an act of economic self-flagellation\".\n\nThe Guardian, external reports on a revelation by the archbishop of Canterbury that he's the descendant of a slave owner. The paper reports that Justin Welby recently discovered that his biological father - with whom he had no relationship - was the great-great-grandson of Sir James Fergusson, who owned enslaved people on a sugar plantation in Jamaica. Sir James was compensated by the British government when slavery was abolished in the 1830s.

    "Premier League referee David Coote has been suspended after a video allegedly showing him making derogatory comments about Liverpool and the club's former manager Jurgen Klopp was circulated on social media. Refereeing body PGMOL says the suspension comes into force with immediate effect and is pending a full investigation. The video, widely shared on social media, has not been verified by the BBC. It is unclear when it was filmed or its authenticity. A source told the BBC that PGMOL's inquiry is treating the video as genuine. Coote, 42, refereed Liverpool's 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday. He is one of the Premier League\u2019s most-experienced officials and has been refereeing matches in the top flight since 2018. The video being shared appears to refer to a Premier League match that Coote officiated between Liverpool and Burnley in July 2020, which finished 1-1. Klopp criticised Coote after the match, saying the referee failed to give fouls for challenges made on Liverpool's players. In the video the man alleged to be Coote says Klopp had \"a right pop at me when I reffed them against Burnley in lockdown\". He calls Klopp arrogant and also swears several times when referring to him. The video shows him with another man and lasts for just over a minute. The circumstances of how the video emerged are unclear. PGMOL says it will not be making further comment on the case until its investigation is completed. BBC Sport has been told Liverpool are aware of the video but not commenting at this stage. Coote, a highly-regarded international Video Assistant Referee who officiated at the Olympic Games in Paris, will now not be involved in any Nations League games this week or next. Speaking to BBC Sport on Monday, English Football League chairman Rick Parry said: \"PGMOL is dealing with it - they have suspended him - they've acted quickly and they will make sure they deal with it thoroughly and professionally.\" Referees are required to inform PGMOL of the club they support. Coote, from Nottinghamshire, is registered as a Notts County fan and is therefore unable to officiate County or Nottingham Forest matches.\n\nWith their first Premier League title secured, Liverpool's aims in July 2020 had switched to becoming the first club to win every single home game during the course of the season. The Reds were on a 24-match winning run at Anfield, which had given them a 25-point lead over Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. In addition, Klopp's side were hoping to become the second team to amass 100 points during a 38-game Premier League season, matching Manchester City's achievement in the 2017-18 campaign. Andrew Robertson gave Liverpool the lead against the Clarets before Jay Rodriguez equalised to give the visitors a share of the spoils. At full-time, Klopp appeared to argue with Coote and his officials on the pitch. \"The referee let lots of challenges go so it was clear that if the ball comes into the box it was dangerous. They [Burnley] did what they are good at and I respect that,\" said Klopp after the match. \"We were angry with the referee but we have to criticise ourselves first for not finishing the game.\" Liverpool lost their next fixture against Arsenal, which ended their hopes of reaching 100 points.\n\nKlopp was angry with Coote following Liverpool's 1-1 draw against Burnley in July 2020\n\nAccording to appearance data from football website Transfermarkt, Coote has refereed 112 Premier League matches, including three Liverpool games. He has refereed Liverpool a further five times in cup games. Those three Liverpool League games as referee were:\n\u2022 None July 2020, the 1-1 draw with Burnley as referenced in the video As one of PGMOL's most highly-rated VAR officials, Coote has been the VAR for 64 Premier League matches, 11 of which have involved Liverpool, the first of which was in September 2019. In October 2020, Coote was the VAR when Liverpool drew 2-2 with Everton and Klopp complained about the decision not to send off Jordan Pickford for a challenge on Virgil van Dijk, as well as a stoppage-time goal from Jordan Henderson being disallowed for offside. Liverpool asked the Premier League to review those two VAR decisions. Coote was then not appointed as the VAR of a Liverpool Premier League match until September 2023, the first of seven Liverpool Premier League matches as VAR last season.\n\u2022 None Follow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

    "The event was a sea of colour as fans dressed up to attend\n\nThousands of comic and gaming fans headed to London on Saturday for one of the most colourful days in the UK\u2019s convention calendar. Fans flocked to the ExCeL centre for the UK's largest gaming, comic and pop culture convention, many of them dressed in elaborate costumes they had constructed themselves. The event, called MCM X EGX, also brought together hundreds of actors, artists and video game publishers who gave fans a sneak peak at upcoming projects. It was the first time the annual video games show had been combined with MCM - which runs Comic Con - meaning guests were treated to a wider range of activities, including lightsaber battles, costume contests and card game sessions.\n\n\u201cI got up at 6am and spent two and a half hours putting this together,\u201d Ellie, dressed as the Joker, told the BBC.\n\nPoppy, dressed as Husk from the cartoon Hazbin Hotel, spent three months building her costume from scratch.\n\nFaisal Mian, who has taught martial arts for 20 years, instructed fans on swordsmanship at the convention.\n\nCatherine Mariah (right) wore a handmade, light-up Beetlejuice-inspired costume. She convinced her siblings Melissa (left) and Tom (centre) to join her this year.\n\nOrganisers told the BBC more than 100,000 people attended the show, travelling from across the UK and beyond. On the multiple stages dotted around the expo, fans formed long queues to hear from over 700 panellists who were speaking. The venue\u2019s two halls were filled with displays, stalls and gameplay areas, with more than 450 exhibitors booking places to demonstrate products or sell merchandise. But none of those numbers can capture the energy, passion and excitement of comics and games enthusiasts at the event, on what many told the BBC was the greatest day of the year. \u201cMy favourite part is meeting other people who are cosplaying,\u201d said Catherine Mariah as she travelled to the event on Saturday morning. \u201cBy the end of the day you\u2019ll be sad it\u2019s all over - you\u2019ll have the 'con blues'!\u201d\n\nThe showcase featured stalls promoting Batman, Captain America, and other comic book characters.\n\nSeveral themed areas were set up around the convention halls, including this one known as The Farm.\n\nProfessional Yu-Gi-Oh player James Tiffin celebrated the card game's 25th anniversary at the show.\n\nGamers were given hands-on time with new releases including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - the latest instalment in the hugely popular first-person shooter series. Fans also got a preview of Avowed - an expansive fantasy role-playing game from US developer Obsidian, which is due for release in February next year. Smaller projects were also on display, like the gesture-controlled indie game Jazzhands, developed by two University of Nottingham students at a 24-hour programming competition. But despite strong fan interest in the video game side of the expo, the gaming industry has been struggling. Several big brands pulled out of this year's show after job cuts and an industry strike hit US development schedules. Organisers at MCM X EGX may have hoped that combining EGX with Comic Con would keep the video games expo alive, while getting a bigger audience for the publishers who stuck with them.",
    "Labour peer Lord Alli is being investigated by the House of Lords' standards watchdog over allegedly failing to register interests. A complaint was made during the last week about the long-standing Labour donor, who has been at the centre of a row over his donations of clothes to senior politicians, including Sir Keir Starmer. The prime minister has insisted he has always followed the rules and said Labour politicians will no longer take donations like this. As a peer in the House of Lords, Alli is required to register his interests in line with the parliamentary code of conduct.\n\nA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cLord Alli will cooperate fully with the Lords\u2019 Commissioner and he is confident all interests have been registered. We cannot comment further while this is ongoing.\" The BBC understands the investigation relates to a clerical element of already declared interests. The specifics of the complaint have not been made public. But Parliament\u2019s website says, external Lord Alli is being investigated over potential breaches of rules about the \u201copenness and accountability\u201d of declarations. The rules say peers must register \u201call relevant interests, in order to make clear what are the interests that might reasonably be thought to influence their parliamentary actions\u201d. The code of conduct also says: \"Members are responsible for ensuring that their registered interests are accurate and up-to-date. They should register any change in their relevant interests within one month of the change.\" The complaint will be investigated by the Lords Commissioners for Standards, who are also investigating the former Tory peer Lady Mone over her alleged involvement for procuring PPE contracts during the pandemic.\n\nThe controversy over donations has dogged Sir Keir\u2019s government since Labour won its landslide general election victory in July. On Wednesday, Downing Street said the the prime minister had paid back more than \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality received since the election. The row over donations started in August, when it emerged that Lord Alli had been given a temporary Downing Street security pass despite having no formal government role. Labour has denied any wrong-doing. Sir Keir has declared accepting donations from Lord Alli in the register of MPs' interests, including accommodation worth more than \u00a320,000. The prime minister said this was to support his son during his GCSE exams. Lord Alli has also made donations worth more than \u00a332,000 for clothing and spectacles to Sir Keir. Donations from Lord Alli were re-categorised in the register after Downing Street sought advice on declarations. Sir Keir is one of seven cabinet ministers who received donations and gifts from Lord Alli in the lead-up to the general election. Earlier this week, the government announced it would tighten the rules around ministerial hospitality to improve transparency. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told the BBC ministers would now have to declare hospitality linked to their government job in the register for MPs too. The prime minister is not the only MP to have received freebies over the past year. Many current MPs from all parties across the Commons list free tickets to sporting and cultural events in their registers of interests.",
    "Sainsbury's and M&S warn Budget may push up prices\n\nShoppers could face higher prices as a growing number of big British firms warn about the cost of the National Insurance (NI) tax rises on employers announced in last week's Budget. Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and BT have all hinted at price rises, while pub chain Wetherspoons said \"all hospitality business\" will increase prices as a result of the tax changes. Meanwhile, Primark's owner said on Tuesday it may invest more overseas due to the \"weight of tax rises\". A Treasury spokesperson said the government \"had to make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\".\n\nFrom next April, employers will have to pay NI at 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000, instead of 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100 currently. The change is set to raise \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history. Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m, a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage. \"I don't think you can shy away from the fact that, because of the changes in everyone's cost base, it is going to feed through into higher inflation,\" he said. \"We will do everything we can to mitigate the impact, like you've seen over the last four years, to really improve our pricing position. \"But this barrage of costs coming at us is significant and we're an industry, a very efficient industry and intensely competitive, and there just isn't capacity to absorb all of this.\" Meanwhile, BT said on Thursday the Budget would have a \u00a3100m impact on the business, with the \"vast majority\" of that coming from the NI changes. \"We intend to offset all of it using the multiple levers we always do when hit with surprises like that... of course, we'll be looking at the price of products and services,\" said chief executive Alison Kirkby. BT said it had also cut 2,000 jobs in the year to 30 September, reducing headcount by 4% to 118,000, as part of an already announced plan to slash 55,000 jobs by 2030 to save costs. In its latest Monetary Policy Report, external, the Bank of England predicted the NI changes would \"have a small upward impact on inflation\". The comments come after Marks & Spencer chief executive Stuart Machin said on Wednesday the supermarket could not rule out price rises following the Budget. Mr Machin said he \"didn't quite see the double whammy coming up\", referring to both the NI rise for employers and the reduction of the threshold for it applying. Asked directly if this would mean higher prices, he said: \"I can't rule out anything because it's still early days in our planning.\" He estimated that the NI change and the increases to minimum wage would cost the business \u00a3120m.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Wetherspoons said that following the Budget taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m... including an estimated 67% increase in National Insurance contributions\". Chairman Tim Martin added: \"All hospitality businesses, we believe, plan to increase prices, as a result. Wetherspoon will, as always, make every attempt to stay as competitive as possible.\" Earlier in the week, Primark's owner Associated British Foods said it may invest beyond the UK because of the \"weight of tax rises\". \"We\u2019re an international business as well, we have choices about where we will invest,\" said chief executive George Weston. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had made NI change as part of a wider plan to \"restore desperately needed economic stability to allow businesses to thrive\". \u201cBy doing this, more than half of employers will either see a cut or no change in their National Insurance bills, there will be \u00a322.6bn more for the NHS and workers\u2019 payslips will be protected from higher tax.\" At the weekend, Chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked whether there was any chance she would rethink the NI rise for employers. \"I'm not immune to their criticism,\" Reeves told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, \"but we've got to raise the money to put our public finances on a firm footing.\" Reeves has been criticised for her repeated claim that the Budget would not include tax rises on \"working people\". The Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills. During a select committee hearing on Tuesday. the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",

    "'I massively regret using AI to cheat at uni'\n\nHannah used an AI tool in her first year at university after being ill with Covid\n\n\"We had two deadlines really close together and I just ran out of steam,\" says Hannah, a university student. \"I felt incredibly stressed and just under enormous pressure to do well. I was really struggling and my brain had completely given up.\" In her desperation - and also suffering with Covid while facing the deadlines - she said she turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to help her write one of the essays. Hannah, not her real name, is now warning others about the potential consequences of using generative AI to cheat at university.\n\nShe faced an academic misconduct panel, who have the power to expel students found to be cheating. Her case highlights the challenge that universities face as they encourage students to become AI literate, whilst discouraging cheating. Hannah's misuse of AI was discovered when her lecturer routinely scanned her essay using detection software. She said: \"My stomach was in knots and I was sitting outside the office. I was like 'this was really stupid'.\" \u201cWhen it got flagged, me and my tutor were sat looking through it and he said you were doing really well up until this point, and then it all went down hill from there. \u201cI\u2019d been scored a zero and I then got an email from my tutor saying we think there\u2019s been some academic misconduct.\u201d\n\nHannah added: \u201cI think in my head initially I thought, 'just deny it, don\u2019t say anything', but then I saw on the screen an AI percentage and it was quite high and I just lasted three minutes before I broke down and said I had used AI to help me finish the essay.\" She was cleared as a panel ruled there wasn\u2019t enough evidence against her, despite her having admitted using AI. Hannah said she thinks it was a slap on the wrist designed to serve as a warning to other students. \"I could have been kicked out,\" she said. \u201cI do massively regret my choice, I was achieving really well, getting a lot of firsts, and I actually think that might have also been the problem, that I needed to maintain that level of grades, and it just kind of really pushed me into a place of using artificial intelligence. \u201cThe fact it was my first year, that\u2019s probably also part of the reason why they decided they weren\u2019t going to take it any further. \u201cIt felt really bad at the end of it, it really tainted that year for me.\"\n\nGenerative AI is technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more human way. It does this by taking in information from its surroundings, and deciding the best response based on what it learns. Universities have been trying to understand what AI applications are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The BBC's Ben Moore writes an essay using AI, but will he be found out?\n\nSome universities ban the use of AI unless specifically authorised, while others allow AI to be used to identify errors in grammar or vocabulary, or permit generative AI content within assessments as long as it is fully cited and referenced. At a bar on the outskirts of Canterbury students here know the limits, and say they only use AI as an aid, like they might a search engine. A student called Taylor told us: \"You\u2019ve got to embrace it. You can ask it questions and it helps you out. \"You can use it to create a guide to structure your work. It\u2019s good for exam prep too.\" And fellow student Zyren said she fell out with a friend who used it extensively. \"They openly admitted to me they use AI, full on copied and pasted an essay they got from Chat GPT. A part of me felt annoyed as it hit me that they might get a higher score than me.\u201d\n\nUniversities UK, an organisation of vice-chancellors and principals of universities, said: \u201cUniversities are aware of the potential risks posed by AI tools in the context of exams and assessment. \"[They] all have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own, engaging with students from day-one on the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.\u201d\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Generative AI has great potential to transform the Higher Education sector and provides exciting opportunities for growth. However, integrating it into teaching, learning, and assessment will require careful consideration. \u201cUniversities must determine how to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks to prepare students for the jobs of the future.\"",
    "Eleanor Brown's actions were described as \"vindictive, selfish and vengeful\"\n\nA woman who posted naked photographs of her father's former mistress on an escort site as an act of \"revenge\" has been jailed for three years. Eleanor Brown set up a fake profile of the woman on the website, her trial heard, which led to the victim's husband being bombarded with calls and messages. Brown, 24, of Peel Street in Morley, had initially denied two counts of disclosing private photographs without consent, but pleaded guilty to both charges part way through her trial. In a statement read out at Leeds Crown Court, the victim said she lived in \"constant fear\" of the photos resurfacing.\n\nThe trial heard Brown's father had an extra-marital affair with the woman in the early 2010s, which was then discovered years later by her while she was a teenager. In August 2022, Brown posted derogatory and abusive messages about the woman on an online profile promoting the victim's husband's business. When this did not provoke the \"reaction she wanted\", she then set up a profile of the woman on an escort site alongside her husband's phone number, the court heard. The hearing was told the victim's husband was bombarded with eight phone calls and 13 texts within half an hour of the advert being posted.\n\nEleanor Brown (centre) sought revenge on their father's former mistress. Her sister Sophie Brown (left) was found guilty of gross misconduct at a police misconduct hearing in April for \"initiating\" and \"encouraging\" Eleanor.\n\nMessages uncovered during the subsequent police investigation showed Brown was \"egged on\" by both her sister Sophie, who was a serving police officer at the time, and her mother, the court was told, though neither were charged over their actions. Sophie Brown was however found to have committed gross misconduct at a police hearing in April for having \"encouraged\" her sister's actions. The misconduct panel ruled she would have been sacked had she not already resigned. Eleanor Brown also contacted the daughter of the victim and her husband, who had not been aware of the affair, and sent her a \"lengthy and vindictive\" message the sentencing heard. She told her she would never \"allow her to forget\" what her mother had done \"to my family\". A victim impact statement read out on the woman's behalf told how she felt \"anxious and nauseous\" to this day. \"The thought of my pictures being used by a complete stranger sickens me,\" she said. \"I find it hard to believe a woman would do this to another woman. To say I feel violated is an understatement.\"\n\nMitigating for Brown, Harry Crowson said, while there was \"every instinct to believe she was entirely undeserving of sympathy\", her teenage years had been deeply affected by the discovery of the affair. He added: \"She needs to stop fighting a battle that isn't hers. She has, at the age of 24, experienced trauma far outstripping her age.\" Judge Alexander Menary said Brown's actions had been \"vindictive, selfish and vengeful\" and told her that she had \"relished the obvious discomfort\" the offending had caused. The judge said her decision to initially deny the offences had been an \"act of brinkmanship\", forcing the victim and her husband to go through the stress of giving evidence at trial. Sentencing her to consecutive terms of two and one years for each of the charges, Judge Menary told her: \"Your lack of remorse is staggering.\" Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here, external.",
    "The singer Jelly Roll is going to appear at the Invictus Games in February\n\nPrince Harry has appeared in a knockabout comedy sketch about getting a tattoo, as he promotes the next round of his Invictus Games. The prince plays the part of a nervous customer as he faces the prospect of getting a first tattoo from US singer Jelly Roll. \"Alright, screw it, let's go,\" says the prince, in a video published on social media. In exchange the singer says he will appear at the Invictus Games for wounded service men and women, being held in Vancouver in February.\n\nThe release of the video might also explain why the prince was seen in a tattoo parlour in New York earlier this year. Jelly Roll, no stranger to the tattooist's art himself, says he wants to give the prince a tattoo on the neck, as the pair are filmed in the East Side Ink tattoo studio. \"I was thinking of my lower back or my...\" as the prince points towards his backside and the captions turn to emojis. Jelly Roll, who has spent time in jail, promises a small tattoo - which turns out to be a big advert for the games on Prince Harry's neck. \"Commitment prince,\" urges the singer, when Harry flinches and seems to have that inking feeling. The comedy video and pretend tattoo, which seem a very long way from anything likely to be published by the royal palaces, are intended to grab attention for this winter's Invictus Games. Jelly Roll, who has won country music awards, will appear at the closing ceremony in Vancouver on 16 February.\n\u2022 None Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?",
    "The drama and farce of the Baker Street bank heist\n\nThe tunnel into Lloyds Bank was described in court as \"a remarkable piece of engineering\"\n\nIn the autumn of 1971, a group of men came together who would carry out one of the most astonishing bank raids in history. Skill, audacity and patience, criminal connections, a fair amount of luck, and inspiration from a Sherlock Holmes story culminated in a weekend of high drama and barely believable farce. A weekend in which a gang tunnelled into a secure vault and made off with the contents of hundreds of secure deposit boxes, while all the time being listened to by an amateur radio operator who was trying to tune in to pirate radio. A weekend in which police officers were on one side of the vault's door while the gang were on the other, and nobody thought to check inside. As Lloyds Bank announces the upcoming closure of its Baker Street branch, external in central London, this is the story of how one of the most secure locations in the country was plundered - and even now, remains partly unsolved.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn a Friday night in September 1971, a group of men, clutching sandwiches and flasks of tea, made their way into SAC, a leather goods shop on Baker Street. The previous May, the lease for the shop came up for sale and was duly bought by Benjamin Wolfe, a man in his 60s. He had been especially keen on the premises because it was two doors down from Lloyds Bank and it had a basement the same depth as the bank's vault. Before even that, in December 1970, an apparently well-to-do man opened an account at the Baker Street branch of Lloyds and put \u00a3500 (about \u00a36,000 today) into it. Later, he rented a safety deposit box at the branch. Like many wealthy clients, he made frequent visits to his box in the vault. Unlike many wealthy clients, he used the time to measure the room with his umbrella.\n\nOther circumstances played into the hands of the group. The summer had seen a number of roadworks in the area. The vibrations caused by the work led to businesses' trembler alarms repeatedly going off. So the businesses disabled their trembler alarms.\n\nDetectives and uniformed officers went to inspect the interior of the bank after staff found the vault in a \"state of some disorder\"\n\nOriginally thought to have been organised by a Brian Reader, who was later involved in both the Brinks-Mat heist and the Hatton Garden raid, the personnel of the gang has never been fully established. Reader, who died aged 84 last year with an estimated fortune of \u00a322m garnered from his string of high-risk burglaries, denied he took part. Four people, including Wolfe and Anthony Gavin, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Reader's, were jailed in 1973. It's thought at least another four, including a woman, slipped away.\n\nThe lease of the leather goods shop SAC was bought by one of the gang\n\nOther unanswered questions include how much was taken. It was reported that it could be anything between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a33m (today's equivalent of \u00a36m and \u00a340m). Only a fraction was recovered, and the rest went untracked. There were rumours involving government suppression of the story, for reasons unknown. And records about it officially sealed at the national archives, external until 2071. And is there any truth to the claim that one box contained photographs of Princess Margaret in an intimate clinch?\n\nIf police had looked into the leather goods shop on the night they were called out, they would have found a tunnel into the bank's vault\n\nGavin allegedly came up with the scheme after reading a Sherlock Holmes story, The Red-Headed League. In it, Arthur Conan-Doyle's hero waits in a vault for burglars planning to tunnel in. Alongside Wolfe, Gavin recruited Reginald Tucker (who was the umbrella-wielder) and Thomas Stephen. Two others, Bobby Mills and Mickey Gervaise, were thought to be on board - although afterwards they disappeared into \"thin air\", the police investigation found.\n\nPolice removed more than 800 items of evidence, a trial heard\n\nTea flasks and sandwiches were not the only items carted inside the leather shop. Stephen, recruited for his ability to provide the necessary tools, had produced a 100-tonne jack, explosives, and a thermal lance, which heats and melts steel with pressurized oxygen to create very high temperatures. Months of weekends were spent digging the 40ft tunnel, with debris being taken away in plastic boxes under cover of darkness. When it was time for the raid, Mills, furnished with a walkie-talkie, mounted a nearby roof to keep an eye out as the others went through the tunnel and worked on breaking into the vault. The jack didn't work, and nor did the thermal lance. It would have to be the gelignite. Timing the explosion to coincide with traffic to conceal the noise, they managed to break through.\n\nPolice check the alarm that didn't sound as the burglars burrowed into the bank\n\nMeanwhile, in his attempt to tune into Radio Luxembourg, Robert Rowlands was picking up the gang's walkie-talkie conversations on his ham radio. The 35-year-old was listening to them in real time as they co-ordinated their movements and the rooftop lookout beefed about how cold he was. Mr Rowlands heard the group discuss whether to take a break as their exploits had left the vault full of fumes, smoke and dust. One tunneller requested a cup of tea and a sandwich. They also mentioned how many \"thousands\" they had and what they would go back for. Mr Rowlands assumed they were burgling a tobacco shop and the numbers referred to cigarettes. Local police were not interested. A few hours later Mr Rowlands called Scotland Yard, where detectives were indeed interested. They called in a detection van from the Post Office in an attempt to trace the walkie-talkie signal. But they didn't do this until Sunday afternoon, when it was all over.\n\nThe bank manager, who was \"roused from his bed\" the previous night, explained to customers the branch was shut\n\nThe Times reported the following day: \"Bank managers and caretakers were roused from their beds and brought from weekend holiday retreats to open their premises. \"Police, accompanied by security men, went into the bank, but after being assured that the strong room was intact, they left. \"As they closed the front door of the Lloyds premises, the thieves, some of them crouching behind the strong room doors, breathed a sigh of relief. \"The slightest gasp might have given away their position. \"Soon afterwards the thieves crawled back along the 40ft tunnel. They escaped through a back window leaving eight tons of rubble from the tunnel behind.\" Or, as bank staff said, with remarkable understatement when they opened the branch on Monday morning: \"We found the vault in some disorder.\"\n\nPolice and news reporters gathered outside the branch on Baker Street\n\nCdr Robert Huntley, of Scotland Yard, said: \"Inevitably, we have come in for some criticism, from people who say we were slow to move off the mark. \"When we were able to visit the bank with Lloyds security staff we were assured that the strong room was still intact. No one suspected that the gang had come up through the floor on the other side.\" It was the biggest robbery ever carried out in the Metropolitan Police district, with 120 detectives working on the case. \"We are getting information about who are the real brains behind this gang\", Cdr Hunt said. \"We think that the 'Mr Big' is probably a faceless commuter. I do not know him.\"\n\nRobert Rowlands, left, raised the alarm after picking up the gang's walkie-talkie conversations on his ham radio\n\nGavin - whose tunnel-digging was described at the Old Bailey as \"a magnificent piece of engineering\" - Tucker and Stephen all pleaded guilty to entering the bank as a trespasser, stealing cash and jewellery and possessing explosives. Wolfe was found guilty of the same charges. Passing sentence, Judge Sutcliffe QC, said: \"Each one of you must have known that the reward for success would be very high and the penalty for failure would be high as well.\" Wolfe was given eight years in jail, while the others received 12. Judge Sutcliffe told Wolfe he was passing a lesser sentence on him only because of his great age. \"I am not going to have on my conscience the sentencing of a man for so long that he has little chance of leaving prison alive.\"\n\nThe bank will close on 6 January, Lloyds said\n\nThe aftermath of the case saw an undignified bout of finger-pointing. Scotland Yard said it was let down by the security staff of Lloyds Bank, who in turn said they had been assured their alarms were \"foolproof\". The Post Office complained it could have caught the gang if it had been called in earlier. There were also questions as to why police did not check the leather shop, which would not only have revealed the tunnel leading straight into the vault, but the men inside, busily opening 286 safety deposit boxes.\n\nThe tunnel started inside the SAC shop and ran underground to the bank\n\nThe heist was the inspiration for a 2008 film, The Bank Job. It includes a plotline in which the British Security Services want to retrieve some compromising photographs of Princess Margaret, allegedly held in a security box by Trinidadian militant gangster Michael X. The obvious solution was to get a gang to tunnel into the vault. The storyline boosted a rumour that appeared in newspapers, in which an anonymous \"friend\" said Reader was definitely involved in the heist and had told him he found photos showing a leading politician abusing children. Reader apparently left the images \"scattered on the floor of the vault\" for the police to find. There has been no evidence this was true. Another rumour was that the government imposed a \"D-notice\" - now called a DSMA-notice - on the story. This hinges on a lack of coverage of the story, with many claiming it disappeared from the news agenda. A DSMA-notice is issued to prevent inadvertent public disclosure of information that would compromise UK military and intelligence operations. It is not usually used to silence news stories about bank jobs that have already happened. The lack of published stories, though, isn't quite true. Naturally, interest died down, but the raid was still being reported in national and regional papers throughout the decade. The rumour may have started with radio ham Mr Rowlands, who said police had snatched a phone out of his grasp while he spoke to a newspaper about his part in the case. He said the officer had told the editor he was not allowed to publish anything. Years later, Mr Rowlands suggested the police were trying to cover up what appeared to be their own incompetence. The only mystery that remains is what is in the 800 pages of sealed documents at the National Archives. They are due to be released in 47 years time.\n\nSo what did Lloyds Bank say about the whole event? It advised customers to insure valuables kept in their safety boxes and denied any liability. After all, it said: \"It is a little unusual for raiders to come up through the floor.\"",
    "Are quadruple-winning Wigan now the greatest?\n\nWigan show off the collection of trophies they have won during 2024 following their Grand Final victory over Hull KR\n\nHad Wigan won just one major trophy this season, that would be considered the benchmark for a club of their stature - figureheads of northern hemisphere rugby league. Two? With the riches head coach Matt Peet has to offer in his squad, such an achievement looked a real possibility. Three would have been an outstanding feat. But to wrap up all four major domestic and international trophies on offer in a single season is not just impressive, it's downright ridiculous in the modern era. Thirty years on from the Wigan side of 1994 lifting all the trophies they could manage in the course of one campaign, the Cherry and Whites have done it again. Asked in his post-match news conference following Wigan's 9-2 Grand Final victory over Hull KR whether his side match up to the squad of 1994, Peet batted the question away. \"No, truthfully and honestly,\" he said. \"It's nice to be asked and nice to be mentioned.\" Modest he may well be, but not many can match the Wigan side we have seen over the past eight months.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTo put this season's achievements in context, Peet is not even 100 games into his tenure as Wigan boss. He's been at the helm for just 99, in fact. And in that period he has won everything he possibly can do, collecting a total of seven pieces of silverware. The list makes for incredible reading: two Challenge Cups, two League Leaders' Shields, two triumphs at Old Trafford in successive Super League Grand Finals, too. All three have been won this season by the Warriors, on top of the trophy that kicked off their glorious 2024 - the World Club Challenge victory over National Rugby League premiers Penrith Panthers, themselves in the conversation for being among the game's greatest sides after winning their fourth successive title. The way Wigan have ended their campaign is also nothing short of remarkable. They did not concede a single try in their final four games and conceded just two points in that time - Mikey Lewis' penalty in the Grand Final. In fact, they have only conceded three tries over the course of the past two Grand Finals, the Challenge Cup final win over Warrington in June and their World Club Challenge triumph - so it is no wonder Peet credits his defence as the reason for their success. \"I attach defence to team spirit and culture. Bevan French has his moments with the ball, it's amazing how he has that innate talent,\" Peet said. \"But he's always contributing towards defence. \"Defence runs through everything we do. They looked like they were enjoying defending today. \"We continued to turn up for one another. That's why defence makes me proud. It comes down to how much you want to do it for each other.\"\n\nWhat makes the ascent of Peet and Wigan even more remarkable is the position the club were in when their coach took over. A mild-mannered figure who had risen through the ranks at Wigan, the club recruited him from within for his first head coach role, replacing the outgoing Adrian Lam, who had failed to put a dent in the St Helens dynasty that had begun under Justin Holbrook with their 2019 Grand Final triumph against Salford. After Holbrook ventured to the NRL, Kristian Woolf picked up the mantle and turned Saints into superstars of Super League, winning four titles in a row. Club legend Paul Wellens stepped in and himself won the World Club Challenge against Penrith - in their backyard no less - in the early days of his Saints tenure. That Peet and a revitalised Wigan side were able to end their rivals' dynasty and start their own period of domination says a lot about the culture both on and off the field. It is no surprise his players speak so highly of Peet. \"He knows how to get the best out of everyone. It's a pleasure to work with someone like him,\" French said. \"I think I speak on everyone's behalf for what he's achieved for us. He's turned the club around in a short amount of time. I think he deserves every bit of recognition that he can get. \"I know myself personally, and everyone else in the team, wants to work hard for him.\"\n\nTry-scorer Bevan French won the Rob Burrow Award for man of the match in Wigan's Grand Final win over Hull KR\n\nSaturday's victory over Hull KR under the lights at Old Trafford wrote Wigan's name into the record books as the first team to win the quadruple in the course of one season in the Super League era. In doing so they matched the record of the Wigan side of 1994 when they became the first side to ever win all four major trophies in the course of one campaign. Bradford in 2003-04 and St Helens in 2006-07 achieved the feat of holding all four trophies at the same time, albeit across the course of two seasons. French has been at the core of a side so tuned to each other that they just keep winning. After scoring in the Challenge Cup final he had a spell out through injury, but he made his return in time for Wigan's end-of-season run-in. His try against Hull KR cemented French's reputation as a player for the big occasion, underlined by man-of-the-match awards in the World Club Challenge, Challenge Cup final and Super League Grand Final. Despite his try-scoring exploits, French, like his boss, once again credited Wigan's defence. \"I've been fortunate enough to set up tries or score them, but in all those finals it was our defence,\" French said. \"It's great to achieve those man-of-the-matches in those finals, but collectively our defence was a bonus.\"",
    "A British businessman caught on camera confessing he was illegally selling luxury perfume to Russia is not facing criminal charges, the BBC has learned. David Crisp admitted to an undercover investigator that he had \u201cignored government edicts\u201d on sanctions by selling the \u00a31,000-a-bottle perfume in Russia. The BBC can now exclusively show the undercover video, which has previously only been shared in court. Mr Crisp was arrested in 2023 by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) - the UK government agency responsible for sanctions enforcement - but the investigation was dropped earlier this year. This is despite the discovery of evidence that he tried to conceal more than \u00a31.7m of illegal sales. Mr Crisp, from Surrey, denies knowingly breaching sanctions or concealing trades with Russia. There has not been a single UK criminal conviction for violating trade sanctions on Russia, the BBC understands, since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago. Failing to punish violators is \u201ca bad signal to send\u201d and makes the UK look like a \u201csoft touch,\u201d says senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who has been calling for tougher action against Russia.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Undercover filming: David Crisp tells a private investigator how he sells perfume to Russia\n\nMr Crisp travelled the world selling high-end perfume, regularly rubbing shoulders with celebrities and VIPs, who were unaware of his activities in Russia. But when he started chatting to a friendly American in the lift of a luxury hotel in Dallas in July last year, he had no idea he was actually speaking to a private investigator. Posing as a Las Vegas businessman, the agent said he was interested in stocking Mr Crisp\u2019s perfumes. They later met in Crisp\u2019s hotel room to smell the fragrances - where the investigator secretly filmed the conversation. \u201cHow\u2019s your Russian market?\u201d the investigator asked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Mr Crisp replied, \u201cWe\u2019re doing really well\u2026 we ignore government edicts.\u201d After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the UK government introduced sanctions banning trade with Russia in several areas - perfumes are specifically named. Breaching these regulations is a serious offence, with a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years. Following the introduction of sanctions, Mr Crisp had agreed with his then-business partner, David Garofalo, to cease trading with Russia. But Mr Garofalo later became suspicious after a whistleblower claimed that Crisp continued to sell perfume in Moscow. Mr Garofalo then hired the private investigators. The undercover footage is \u201csickening\u201d David Garofalo told me as we watch the footage together, adding \u201che knows that he\u2019s violating the sanctions\u201d.\n\nDavid Garofalo halted all sales to Russia once he took full control of the company\n\nWithout Mr Crisp\u2019s knowledge, the company also compiled a dossier of evidence that he had knowingly violated sanctions. Staff also found pallets of goods in the company\u2019s UK facility with paperwork showing recipients in Russia, and international shipping data confirming deliveries. Products were discovered on sale in Moscow that the company had only launched after the imposition of sanctions. \u201cHe had actually gone out of his way to disguise the fact that he\u2019d continued selling to Russia,\u201d Mr Garofalo told us. \u201cHe had deceived our in-house lawyer and misled our auditors.\u201d Mr Garofalo reported Mr Crisp to HMRC and it opened a criminal investigation. At the same time, Mr Garofalo pursued a civil case against his partner to remove him from the company. In July this year, a High Court judge granted a rare provisional injunction, meaning Mr Crisp would be removed immediately pending the full civil trial. In his ruling, the judge said the undercover video was \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that Mr Crisp knew he was breaching sanctions and the company accounts showed he \u201cconcealed the Russian trading\u201d. After taking full control of the company, Mr Garofalo immediately halted all sales to Russia. In a statement, David Crisp told the BBC: \u201cI strongly refute the allegations made against me by Mr Garofalo, at no point did I knowingly trade in breach of Russian sanctions\u2026 at no point did I attempt to conceal those trades\u2026 the companies' trades with Russia were well known to those within the business\u2026 I look forward to being fully exonerated.\u201d\n\nHMRC officers arrested Mr Crisp upon arrival at Gatwick Airport in October 2023 and seized his passport. But, by July this year, HMRC had dropped its investigation and told Mr Crisp that it would take no further action against him, returning his passport. Mr Garofalo told us he was shocked HMRC had showed no interest in the evidence he had collected. \u201cIt was an open and shut case. The evidence was just irrefutable.\u201d HMRC does not comment on individual cases, but it told the BBC that failure to comply with sanctions is a serious offence, and those who breach them could face enforcement actions including financial penalties or referral for criminal prosecution. Its statement added: \u201cHMRC has fined five companies for breaches of the Russia sanctions regulations in the last two years, including a \u00a31m fine issued in August 2023.\u201d But the BBC understands there haven\u2019t been any criminal prosecutions for violating trade sanctions on Russia since February 2022.\n\nTim Ash says the \u201callure of doing business with Russia... is too much for some people\u201d\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith MP, the chair of a committee of MPs working on sanctions against Russia, told the BBC the Crisp case isn\u2019t a \u201cone-off\u201d. \u201cIn terms of prosecution and seriously pursuing people over sanctions, the UK is very poor indeed,\u201d said Sir Iain. \u201cIf we don't prosecute, who the hell is deterred from breaching sanctions? He said other countries including the US, were \u201clight years\u201d ahead of the UK in terms of prosecuting violators. \u201cThere needs to be arrest, prosecution and incarceration. And if we don't do that, then there's no such thing as sanctions.\u201d The former Conservative Party leader said that HMRC often reached settlements, instead of issuing large fines or criminal convictions. \u201cThe authorities may say the sanctions breaches are too small to prosecute, but the answer is you prosecute the small ones, because the big ones need to know that you're coming after them as well,\u201d he added. The UK government had hoped sanctions would be a deterrent, without the need for robust enforcement, according to Tim Ash from the foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe reality is, the allure of doing business with Russia, the huge profits to be made, are too much for some people,\u201d explained Mr Ash. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in their bottom line, as opposed to the bottomless pit of Ukrainians dying.\u201d He said cases like Mr Crisp\u2019s sent a clear message that there would be no consequences for continuing business with Russia. \u201cWe are almost three years into the [full-scale] invasion, and the fact that we haven't got our sanctions regime together is pretty extraordinary.\u201d",

    "A Married at First Sight groom has admitted he made a \"massive mistake\" during his time on the Channel 4 reality show. Caspar Todd, a gardener from the New Forest, married Emma Barnes, a complete stranger that he had been matched with by a panel of experts. He was heavily criticised both online and on the show for telling his new bride during their honeymoon that he had \"rarely gone for the curvier person\". Mr Todd told BBC Radio Solent that he had apologised \"thousands of times\" and would keep on apologising as \"you don't say something like that\".\n\nThe ninth season of MAFS UK is currently being broadcast on E4\n\nHe described their whole honeymoon in Jamaica as a \"very bizarre situation\" and said he was \"feeling quite alone\" and was just \"trying to work out where the spark's coming from\". Married at First Sight is a social experiment, where single people marry total strangers, meeting for the first time at the altar. The weddings on the show are not legally binding. In 2018, former contestants from Love Island and Geordie Shore warned about the impact being on a reality TV show can have on mental health. They urged producers behind such programmes to offer better support to their contestants. But Caspar praised the support he has received from the show's welfare team, who he said have been in touch with him while the programme airs. \"Every day I have a call from the welfare team from Channel 4 and I also have access to a psych as well and they're fantastic,\" he said. \"So if I really am struggling, and I'm not going to lie when you're thrust into it, and then everyone starts knowing who you are and you're being recognised in Tesco and that sort of stuff, it becomes quite a lot. \"So having that support network behind you, who are going to just pick up a phone to you and say yep, we'll sort you out, it's been great.\"\n\nThe show is still being broadcast so Caspar cannot say whether things worked out in the end with his wife Emma. But he was clear on one thing, he was unlikely to be popping up again on our screens anytime soon. \"No,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I probably wouldn't do reality TV again - given the option.\"\n\nDo you have a story BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight should cover?",

    "Three charged in connection with Liam Payne's death\n\nThree people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction star Liam Payne, Argentinian authorities have said. The singer died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires. Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office said one person, who had been accompanying Payne, is accused of \"the abandonment of a person followed by death\". A hotel employee and a third person have also been charged with supplying drugs. None of those arrested have been named.\n\nPayne, 31, a father-of-one, became one of the most recognisable names in pop after appearing on The X Factor and rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s. Argentinian authorities have been investigating Payne's final days at the CasaSur hotel. After the singer's death, police found substances in his hotel room and destroyed objects and furniture. Hotel staff had made two calls to emergency services saying they had a guest who had taken \"too many drugs and alcohol\", and was \"trashing the entire room\", it was previously reported. On Thursday, the public prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his body. A post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as \"multiple trauma\" and \"internal and external haemorrhage\", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony. According to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness. The prosecutor's office say this rules out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act by Payne, and they have concluded the singer did not know what he was doing nor have any comprehension of his actions. In addition, authorities have carried out nine raids on houses in Buenos Aires. They are continuing to investigate Payne's broken laptop and other devices seized. The prosecutor's office added it has examined more than 800 hours of video footage from security cameras in the hotel and on public roads, and received dozens of testimonies from hotel staff, family members, friends and medical professionals. The singer's body was released to his family on Wednesday to be flown back to the UK.\n\nFollowing Payne's death, tributes flooded in including from his former partner Cheryl, One Direction bandmates and music mogul Simon Cowell. Payne\u2019s bandmates Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Harry Styles said in a joint statement that they were \u201ccompletely devastated\u201d and will miss the singer \u201cterribly\u201d, adding the \u201cmemories we shared with him will be treasured forever\u201d. Thousands of fans also remembered the late singer at memorial events in the UK and around the world.",
    "Man who drugged wife in French mass rape case told: You'll die alone\n\nCaroline Darian accused her father of lying to the court, saying she was convinced he abused her\n\nTensions at the French mass rape trial burst into the open on Wednesday when Dominique Pelicot\u2019s daughter Caroline shouted at her father from across the courtroom that he would \u201cdie alone like a dog\u201d. Caroline Darian, 45, has repeatedly said she is convinced her father drugged and abused her after semi-naked photos of her asleep were found on his laptop. He has denied abusing her but has admitted drugging his wife Gis\u00e8le for a decade and recruiting men online to rape her in their home when she was unconscious. Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men have been on trial since September, and a verdict is expected on 20 December.\n\nDuring an emotional day in court in Avignon, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's lawyers gave their closing arguments, describing the historic nature of the trial and paying tribute to her courage in waiving her anonymity to bring the mass rape trial into the open. In her statements to the court Caroline spoke of her anguish at what she says are persistent lies by her father. Earlier this week, with a voice full of emotion, she told the court her life had \u201cstopped\u201d when police first showed her photos from her father's laptop in 2020. On Wednesday, Dominique Pelicot was given a chance to address his daughter while taking the stand for the final time in this trial. The main defendant said he most wished he still had Caroline's support. \u201cSome may laugh but it\u2019s my daughter I wish I could look at in the face. It hurts to see her like this,\u201d he said, sitting in a glass box only metres away from his daughter and the rest of his family. \u201cI would love to see her, I would love to talk to her,\u201d he added. As his voice faltered, Caroline\u2019s rose: \u201cI will never come see you. Never. You will die alone like a dog,\u201d she shouted. \u201cWe all die alone,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou especially,\u201d she hit back. It was the last public exchange between a father and daughter who by all accounts had had, for many years, a loving and close relationship. Mr Pelicot recalled visiting her in hospital when she was recovering from surgery as a child so he could hold her and comfort her, and shared memories of her teenage years. When he repeated that he would always love her even if she had stopped loving him, she looked ahead silently, tears streaming down her face \u2013 but did not respond. It was only later, when the session ended, that she approached the box her father sat in and shouted: \u201cYou had two months [to tell the truth]!\u201d\n\nDuring questioning, Mr Pelicot also stated that he was a sex addict and that getting found out by police in November 2020 had \u201cunburdened him\u201d. He denied that his crimes against his wife had been sparked by an inferiority complex or by a desire for revenge for an affair she had in the 1980s. Asked what he thought about chemical submission - drugging someone for the purposes of coercion or assault - he answered: \u201cIt\u2019s crap. It annihilates everything. It should never be done.\u201d Mr Pelicot\u2019s statements were followed by closing arguments from Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s legal team. Lawyers for the 50 other defendants will give their own closing arguments from next week. They are expected to explore more deeply the defence that many of the men cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her. Over almost three hours Ms Pelicot's lawyers, Antoine Camus and St\u00e9phane Babonneau, retold the horrific story of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s crimes, peppering their account with literary references. \"Everyone contributed to this monstrosity on their own level, and allowed a woman's ordeal to go on. It's the banality of evil of [philosopher] Hannah Arendt,\" said Mr Camus.\n\nGis\u00e8le Pelicot gave evidence for the final time on Tuesday\n\nThey pleaded with the judges to hand down sentences that reflected the extent of the suffering of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and her family. Mr Camus said he was aware of the \u201cexpectations and hopes in this room and beyond\u201d for the trial, which he said he described as historic, because \u201cwe badly, urgently want and need it to be\". Leaning heavily on the notion of free will, he dismissed the defence\u2019s argument that many of the men who allegedly raped Ms Pelicot did so because they were intimidated, manipulated or tricked by her husband. \"Manipulation is not hypnosis,\" he said. The fact they were all aware that Mr Pelicot was \u201crecruiting\u201d many other men too should be taken into account by the judges, he added. \u201cEveryone who came into that house of horrors knew that others had come before him and others would follow,\u201d Mr Camus said. His colleague painted a devastating picture of Ms Pelicot\u2019s life since her husband\u2019s crimes had become known. St\u00e9phane Babonneau then described what had led Ms Pelicot \u2013 who by then was living in a small village under her maiden name \u2013 to give up her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media. It was in 2023, he said, when French media began reporting on the Pelicot case using pseudonyms that \u201ca feeling of rebellion started to take hold of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\". \"She decided to take back control of her life. The moment had come for shame to change sides.\u201d The will to stop hiding had awoken in her, he said, because she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. And she thought the details of her case and the videos of the alleged assaults would help expose the reality of rape. \u201cFor her story to be useful and to help other women she understood she had to give up the anonymity that had served her for years,\u201d Mr Babonneau explained. \u201cShe had to accept she would forever be the victim of the Mazan rapes.\u201d The lawyer also urged judges not to accept that the defendants had made a \u201cmistake\u201d when \u2013 as some have said \u2013 they raped Ms Pelicot involuntarily or \u201cout of stupidity or ignorance\u201d. \u201cIf you accept the right to make a mistake, what will stop another man tomorrow from saying that when a woman told him \u2018no\u2019 he actually understood \u2018yes\u2019? That he also made a mistake?\u201d \u201cI ask you to reject the right to make mistakes which would put society in danger \u2013 and at the risk of seeing more Gis\u00e8le Pelicots,\u201d Mr Babonneau said. He ended by paying tribute to Ms Pelicot and said the trial would be a \u201clegacy\u201d for future generations: \u201cThey will hear the name Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, they will hear about her courage and about the price she paid.\u201d Turning to look at Ms Pelicot, he said: \u201cYou did your job. You went beyond what was expected of you.\u201d \u201cNow, pass on the torch to the others to carry on the fight you never chose.\u201d Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, to his right, wiped her eyes.",
    "Russia ready to wage cyber war on UK, minister to say\n\nRussia is ready to carry out cyber attacks on the United Kingdom and other allies in a bid to weaken support for Ukraine, a senior minister will warn later. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, whose role includes responsibility for national security, is set to tell a Nato meeting that the Kremlin could target British businesses and leave millions without power. It is the latest in a series of warnings about the cyber-warfare capabilities of Russia, which McFadden is to call a \"hidden war\" being waged against Ukraine. He is also expected to single-out Russia's Unit 29155, which the government says has carried out a number of attacks in the UK and Europe.\n\nIn a speech to the Nato Cyber Defence Conference at Lancaster House in London, the cabinet minister will warn \"cyber war can be destabilising and debilitating\" and describe the Kremlin as \"exceptionally aggressive and reckless\" in this area. McFadden will focus on the threat of Russia's capacity to shut down power grids and \"turn the lights off for millions of people\", as well as its willingness to target British businesses \"in pursuit of its malign goals\". \"Given the scale of that hostility, my message to members today is clear: no-one should underestimate the Russian cyber threat to Nato. The threat is real,\" he will tell the gathered Nato allies. He will claim that hacking groups aligned with the Russian state have been responsible for at least nine separate cyber attacks against NATO states, including unprovoked assaults against critical national infrastructure. McFadden's comments are the latest in a series of warnings about the increasing threats of Russian cyber warfare. In September, a joint defence briefing by Western intelligence agencies accused Unit 29155 of carrying out attacks designed to disrupt efforts to aid Ukraine in resisting Russia's full-scale invasion. The group are believed to be behind the poisonings of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018. In the UK in recent weeks, a series of recent cyber-attacks have been carried out on several councils - some of which have been claimed by a pro-Russian hacking group. Among those councils reportedly targeted are in areas including Middleborough, Salford, Portsmouth and Tees. In his speech later, McFadden will tell the conference that many of these attacks are carried out by gangs of \"unofficial hacktivists\" affiliated with the Kremlin, but are allowed to \"act with impunity so long as they're not working against Putin's interests\".",
    "Stokes opted out of IPL to prolong England career\n\nBen Stokes and the England team took part in a mihi whakatau, a welcome, in Christchurch on Tuesday\n\nCaptain Ben Stokes opted out of the Indian Premier League auction in order to prolong his England career. In not taking part in the 'mega-auction' held last weekend, the 33-year-old faces being banned from the tournament for the next two seasons under new competition rules. Speaking before leading England in the first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch on Thursday (22:00 GMT, Wednesday), Stokes told BBC Sport: \"There's no hiding behind the fact that I'm at the back-end of my career. \"It's about looking at what I've got ahead and making the decision that is right for me to be able to prolong my career as long as possible. I want to be wearing this England shirt for as long as I can.\" Stokes has been sold for more than \u00a31m in three IPL auctions and was named the tournament's most valuable player for his spell with Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017. But his more recent career has been plagued by a left-knee issue and he missed four England Tests after sustaining a hamstring injury in August. Stokes is due to lead England on the Ashes tour of Australia next winter. The all-rounder has spoken about his personal struggle during England's 2-1 defeat in Pakistan last month, when he endured a disappointing time on the field after returning from the hamstring problem. During the second Test, Stokes' house was burgled with his wife Clare and two children at home. In Christchurch, the city of Stokes' birth, England begin a three-Test series that will take their total number of matches in 2024 to 17. No England team has ever played more in a calendar year. The tourists are handing a debut to 21-year-old Warwickshire left-hander Jacob Bethell, who will bat at number three despite never before batting higher than number four in first-class cricket.\n\nNew Zealand, fresh from a breathtaking 3-0 series win in India, welcome prolific batter Kane Williamson back from injury and give a first cap to seamer Nathan Smith, who spent part of last summer with Worcestershire. Of a green-tinged pitch, Stokes said: \"If you saw that pitch in England, you'd be praying to God that you won the toss and could bowl first. \"It's amazing in New Zealand. You can look at a wicket and it plays completely different to what it looks like. We'll have to see how we go tomorrow, see what conditions we're faced with as the game goes further, and if we need to adapt to anything we'll try to do that.\" New Zealand's win in India means they have an outside chance of reaching the World Test Championship final, having won the inaugural competition in 2021. They join India, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka in vying for the two spots available, but England sit sixth in the table and are out of contention. \"The World Test Championship is a bit confusing. I don't look at it,\" said Stokes. \"Over a long period of time, if you're playing really good cricket, you're getting results that you want, you'll end up finding yourself in the final and in the mix. \"For me and this team it's about taking it game by game, series by series, and if you end up finding yourself in the position where you happen to be in the final, then it's great. I can't really ever remember if I've ever given any real time specifically to thinking about the World Test Championship.\" England have not won a Test series in New Zealand in four attempts, dating back to 2008. Their last match in this country, a thrilling one-run defeat in Wellington in 2023, was only the fourth time any team had lost a Test after enforcing the follow-on. \"It's a cool rivalry that we've got,\" said New Zealand captain Tom Latham. \"We've had some great battles over the last five, seven years with England and that was no different a couple of seasons ago when they were out here. \"I'm sure it will produce some more thrilling games and both teams are looking forward to getting into it.\"\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",
    "Wait a few more minutes for an electric Uber, says boss\n\nPeople waiting for an Uber should be patient enough to wait a few minutes longer for an electric car, the boss of the ride-hailing firm has said. \"A couple of minutes isn't going to kill anyone,\" Dara Khosrowshahi told the BBC in an interview. Uber is rolling out new options to encourage customers to choose electric rides, but at the same time he says governments should be doing more to support sales of electric vehicles (EVs). Cheaper, Chinese-made electric vehicles are also \"good for the environment\" he said.\n\nDespite that, many countries are pushing back against the import of Chinese EVs because they see them as unfair competition for domestic carmakers. \"High quality\" Chinese-made EVs are part of the solution to the climate crisis, Mr Khosrowshahi said. He also called on the new UK government to stick to its pre-election pledge and end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, after the previous government pushed the deadline back to 2035.\n\nUber's push to get customers to pick the green ride option is part of the company's overall sustainability aims - that all its car journeys and deliveries should be carried out in \"zero emissions vehicles\" by 2040. But the ambition is set to become more challenging as it plans to expand beyond cab rides and food delivery. Customers can already pick an EV when they book an Uber. A new option will allow them to register a permanent preference for taking an electric vehicle. Most Ubers are still petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicles, so it is likely customers will have to wait a little longer for an EV to arrive. \"We're not saying, hey, wait 15 minutes, but if you have to wait another two, three minutes to help the environment, why not make that investment?\" Mr Khosrowshahi said. In London, almost a third of Uber drivers have invested in an EV, so the difference in waiting times may not be long. But EV uptake is lower elsewhere in the UK and worldwide. In European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris only 20% of the miles driven by Uber vehicles are fully electric. As well as benefiting the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi believes the shift to electric will benefit Uber's business in the long run. However, he says the firm currently makes a smaller profit margin on electric car rides.\n\nUber is also introducing more delivery services, hoping to challenge rivals on things like household products and groceries. \"You can get pet food from your local shop with an Uber courier within the next hour or two,\" said Mr Khosrowshahi. \"Ultimately we think that [it] can be even better than Amazon,\" he said. Critics have pointed out that ride-hailing and delivery services have already contributed to a rise in the number of car journeys being made, whether that's swapping a night bus for a cab ride, or getting a bubble tea delivered to your desk.\n\nMr Khosrowshahi wants to take on rival Amazon in home deliveries\n\nMr Khosrowshahi said he understood that governments had broader things to consider around tariffs on electric vehicles, but saw Chinese-made vehicles as part of the solution. \"For us we want to electrify our fleet and we want to make sure that it is affordable for our drivers,\" he said. Price is one of the biggest obstacles to the broader take-up of electric cars. Concerns over electric charging infrastructure have also contributed to EV sales stalling in many parts of the world. Mr Khosrowshahi said he thought governments should be providing more support for the switch to electric, including in the UK, but he would like that support to be targeted at those who drive the most, such as Uber drivers, or for corporate fleets, rather than individuals. \"The Uber driver drives four to five times the miles of average drivers,\" he said. Carmakers are calling for subsidies to be more balanced between business and individual buyers to encourage demand more broadly. The US and European Union (EU) argue the Chinese are unfairly subsiding their carmakers and have imposed tariffs - or import taxes - to bring prices of Chinese cars more into line with domestic manufacturers. The UK has not imposed tariffs on Chinese-made cars. Using tariffs to make Chinese cars more expensive for European and American consumers was \"negative\" for the planet, Mr Khosrowshahi said. Without such tariffs, cars made by Chinese firms could potentially be supplied more cheaply to consumers in US and EU. Uber also has a tie-up with Chinese carmaker BYD, the second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla.\n\nDo you pick the green ride option? Please share your experiences.",
    "Amsterdam violence exposes tensions in society and spills over to politics\n\nTensions remain high in Amsterdam after last week's violence\n\nA fragile calm hangs over the Dutch capital, still reeling from the unrest that erupted a week ago when Israeli football fans came under attack in the centre of Amsterdam. City officials described the violence as a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger\u201d over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. As the streets are cleared of Maccabi Ultras stickers and tensions linger, there is concern about the damage done to relations between Amsterdam\u2019s Jewish and Muslim communities. The tensions have spilled over into Dutch politics too. The Netherlands' coalition government has been left hanging by a thread after a Moroccan-born junior minister resigned because of language used by coalition colleagues. Amsterdam had already seen protests and tensions because of the war in the Middle East, and local Rabbi Lody van de Kamp believes it was like a tinderbox: \"If you put 2,000 [Israeli] football supporters on to the streets, you know you are in trouble.\u201d\n\nPolice were out in force on 8 November but were unable to prevent a series of violent attacks\n\nMaccabi Tel Aviv fans had arrived in the city for a Europa League match against Ajax and footage was widely shared the night before showing a group of fans climbing up a wall to tear down and burn a Palestinian flag. An Amsterdam council report said taxis were also attacked and vandalised. Emine U\u011fur, a well-known columnist in the Muslim community, says underlying tensions surrounding the war in Gaza meant that the ensuing violence was \"a long time coming\". She speaks of a lack of acknowledgement of the pain felt by communities affected by a conflict that had left many without an outlet for their grief and frustration. The flag-burning incident as well as anti-Arab chants were seen as a deliberate provocation. But then messages calling for retaliation appeared on social media, some using chilling terms such as \"Jew hunt\". On the evening of the match, a pro-Palestinian protest was moved away from the Johan Cruyff arena, but it was in the hours afterwards that the violence erupted. The 12-page report by Amsterdam\u2019s authorities describes some Maccabi supporters \u201ccommitting acts of vandalism\u201d in the centre. Then it highlights \u201csmall groups of rioters\u2026 engaged in violent hit-and-run actions targeting Israeli supporters and nightlife crowd\u201d in locations across the city centre. They moved \u201con foot, by scooter, or car\u2026 committing severe assaults\u201d. The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described the incidents as deeply alarming, and noted for some they were a reminder of historical pogroms against Jews. For a few hours, swathes of the Jewish community in a European capital felt as though they were under siege. These events coincided with the anniversary of the Nazi pogroms on Jews in 1938, also known as Kristallnacht. That only intensified the fears of Amsterdam's Jewish community, although local imams and other members of the Muslim community took part in the commemorations. Senior members, including Esther Voet, editor of the Dutch Jewish Weekly, organised emergency shelters and coordinated rescue efforts for those fearing for their lives.\n\nEsther Voet welcomed fans into her home to protect them from attack. Their faces are blurred to hide their identities\n\nThe Dutch government has responded by allocating \u20ac4.5m (\u00a33.6m) to combat antisemitism and support victims. Justice Minister David van Weel emphasised that Jewish people must feel safe in their own country and promised to deal severely with perpetrators. However, the chairman of the Central Jewish Committee, Chanan Hertzberger, warned that these measures alone might not suffice. He blamed in part an atmosphere where \u201cantisemitic rhetoric has gone unchecked since 7 October\", adding: \"Our history teaches us that when people say they want to kill you, they mean it, and they will try.\" The violence and its aftermath have also exposed political rifts, and some of the language from politicians has shocked the Netherlands\u2019 Moroccan community. Geert Wilders, whose far-right Freedom Party is the biggest of the four parties that make up the Dutch coalition government, has called for the deportation of dual nationals guilty of antisemitism. Both he and coalition partner Caroline van der Plas, among others, have pointed the finger at young people of Moroccan or North African descent.\n\nOne Dutch-Moroccan commentator, Hassnae Bouazza, complained that her community had for years been accused of not being integrated, and was now being threatened with having their Dutch nationality taken away. Nadia Bouras, a Dutch historian of Moroccan descent, told Amsterdam\u2019s Het Parool newspaper that using the term \u201cintegration\u201d for people who had already lived in the Netherlands for four generations was like \u201cholding them hostage\u201d. \u201cYou are holding them in a constant state of being foreign, even though they are not.\u201d The junior minister for benefits, Nora Achahbar, who was born in Morocco but grew up in the Netherlands, said on Friday she was standing down from the government because of racist language she had heard during a cabinet meeting on Monday, three days after the violence in Amsterdam.\n\nJunior minister Nora Achahbar decided to resign after she was alarmed by what she called racist language by coalition colleagues\n\nRabbi van de Kamp has told the BBC he is concerned that antisemitism is being politicised to further Islamophobic agendas. He warns against repeating the exclusionary attitudes reminiscent of the 1930s, cautioning that such rhetoric not only endangers Jewish communities but deepens suspicions within society: \"We must show that we cannot be made into enemies.\u201d The impact on Amsterdam's Muslim and Jewish residents is profound. Many Jews have removed mezuzahs - the small Torah scrolls - from their doorposts, or they have covered them with duct tape out of fear of reprisal. Esther Voet sees the emotional toll on her community: \"It\u2019s an exaggeration to say that the Netherlands now is like the 1930s, but we must pay attention and speak out when we see something that\u2019s not right.\" Muslims, meanwhile, argue they are being blamed for the actions of a small minority, before the perpetrators have even been identified. Columnist Emine U\u011fur has herself faced increased threats as a vocal Muslim woman: \"People feel emboldened.\" She fears for her son's future in a polarised society where the lines of division seem to be hardening.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in Amsterdam in the days after the violence, despite a ban on protests\n\nAcademics and community leaders have called for de-escalation and mutual understanding. Bart Wallet, a professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Amsterdam, stresses the need for careful terminology, warning against equating the recent violence with pogroms of the past. Like others, he hopes the violence was an isolated incident rather than a sign of worsening ethnic polarisation. Mayor Femke Halsema is adamant that antisemitism should not be followed by other forms of racism, emphasising that the safety of one group must not come at the expense of another. The violence has left Amsterdam questioning its identity as a diverse and tolerant city. There is a collective recognition, in the Dutch capital and beyond, that as residents seek to rebuild trust, they must address the tensions that fuelled such unrest. Rubbing his hands against the cold, as Amsterdam's cyclists stream by, Rabbi van de Kamp recalls his mother's words: \"We are allowed to be very angry, but we must never hate.\"",
    "Whirlwind of misinformation sows distrust ahead of US election day\n\nRumours, misleading allegations and outright lies about voting and fraud are flooding online spaces in unprecedented numbers in advance of the US election. Hundreds of incidents involving purported voting irregularities are being collected and spread by individuals, as well as both independent and Republican-affiliated groups. A small number of posts are also coming from Democrats. The US government has also alleged that foreign actors, including Russia, are spreading fake videos to undermine confidence in the electoral process. The whirlwind of misinformation spreading online poses a challenge to election officials who are having to debunk rumours and reassure voters, while preparing to administer election day on Tuesday.\n\nMany posts alleging election irregularities support the Trump campaign\u2019s false claim that the former president won the 2020 election and suggestions that he will potentially be cheated out of victory again on 5 November. When asked whether he will accept the 2024 election result, Donald Trump said during the presidential debate in September that he would if it was a \"fair and legal and good election\". A majority of Americans - 70% - expect him to reject the result if he loses, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday. Just this week, Trump himself claimed widespread fraud in a key swing state. \u201cPennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,\u201d Trump posted on his Truth Social network. \u201cREPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!\u201d The allegation followed officials in three Pennsylvania counties saying they were working with local law enforcement to investigate some voter registration applications for potential fraud. While Trump and allies seized on the announcements, the state's top election official, Republican Al Schmidt, has urged caution and warned voters to be aware of \"half-truths\" and disinformation circulating on social media. \u201cThis is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,\u201d he said.\n\nThe BBC has seen hundreds of allegations of election fraud online, on social networks and on message boards and in chat groups. Some of these posts have been viewed millions of times each. The posts have implied it's easy for non-citizens to vote, made false claims about voting machines and sowed distrust in the ballot-counting process. One video claimed to show recently-arrived Haitians voting in Georgia. The BBC has found clear indications, including false addresses and stock photos, which indicate the video is a fake. On Friday US security officials said it was made by \"Russian influence actors\". Another person on X claiming they were Canadian posted a picture of a ballot and said: \u201cFigured I would drive across the border and vote.\" It, too, is a fake, and part of an effort co-ordinated on the fringe message board 4chan. The ballot shown is from Florida, a state that requires identification to vote in person and is about a 20-hour drive from the Canadian border. Meanwhile in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a video was posted on X showing a man dropping off a container of ballots at a courthouse, alleging suspicious activity. It turned out he was a postal worker delivering mail-in ballots, but the video was seen more than five million times.\n\nExperts worry the burst of misinformation just before election day could undermine people's trust in the results - or lead to threats and violence in the lead-up to the election and beyond. In the hours and days that followed the 2020 presidential election, while votes were still being counted, then-President Trump turned to social media to allege fraud and falsely claim that he was the real winner of the election. \"Stop the steal\" became a slogan of his supporters' movement to overturn the results. On social media, chatrooms and during street protests, conspiracy theorists alleged widespread voter fraud, culminating with a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Meanwhile, in battleground states like Georgia, election officials - civil servants whose job it is to oversee the election - faced death threats. While false claims about voting ramped up after the 2020 vote, groups that monitor this kind of activity say this year it has started well before election day. Wendy Via, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said some far-right and right-wing activists \u201care preparing themselves for the election to be stolen in a way they weren\u2019t in 2020\u201d. \u201cWe cannot overstate the role of conspiracy theories in all of this,\u201d she said. These doubts have already reached Trump supporters on the ground. At a rally this week in Wisconsin, another key swing state, a number of people said they believed only illegal activity would prevent the Republican nominee from winning. \u201cI feel very confident about Trump, as long as there\u2019s no cheating,\u201d said Brad Miller of Green Bay, who mentioned that he\u2019d already heard rumours about fraud. \u201cOur only hope is that it\u2019s not big enough to change the result.\u201d After the 2020 election, dozens of court cases alleging election fraud were lodged by Trump's team across multiple states, but none succeeded.\n\nExperts say that isolated incidents of ballot fraud and administrative errors always happen in US presidential elections, which run across all 50 states and in 2020 involved more than 150 million voters. But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating. In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud. \u201cThey WILL cheat,\u201d says one of the thousands of comments posted.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAs cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards. But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to \u201crig\u201d the election. \u201cLook at this new cheat voter fraud,\u201d read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. \u201cDems already doing their best to steal another election.\u201d The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say. \u201cThese incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,\u201d said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.\n\nThe mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations. Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security. On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities. They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure. \u201cOur hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,\u201d said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters. But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale. \u201cIf they want to try to pull the kinds of things that we saw being pulled in 2020, they\u2019re highly unlikely to get away with it because we have, literally, eyes everywhere,\u201d she added. The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment. A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities. Elon Musk\u2019s America political action committee has started a community \u2013 akin to a message board \u2013 on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock. Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers \u2013 partisan observers who attend polling places. The volume of messages on these platforms \u2013 along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources \u2013 makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation. The groups, and the Trump campaign, say that these efforts are solely meant to ensure the integrity of the vote. The BBC contacted the Trump campaign for comment.\n\nExperts say the same rumours and false allegations about widespread fraud that inspired the riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 are resurfacing in advance of this year's election\n\nThe effect of this is unpredictable. The Department of Homeland Security, in a memo reported on by US outlets including the BBC\u2019s partner CBS, said on Monday that election conspiracy theories could spark action by domestic extremists. And observers expect the wave of misinformation to continue well beyond election day. Polls suggest the election will be among the closest in modern US history. It may take days to count all the votes and determine the winner. Luis Lozada of Democracy Works says the election is being conducted in an \u201cecosystem of distrust\u201d. But despite the doubts being sown, he says, \u201caccurate information is getting out there\". \u201cElection officials work very hard to ensure that elections are run properly, as they were in 2020,\u201d Mr Lozada said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to stop folks from taking anecdotes, and trying to punch holes.\u201d",
    "US President Joe Biden has agreed to give Ukraine anti-personnel land mines, a US defence official told the BBC, a move seen as an attempt to slow Russian troops who have been steadily advancing in Ukraine's east in recent months. The official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said such mines would be delivered soon and Washington expected that they would be used on Ukraine's territory. Ukraine was also committed to not using the mines in densely-populated areas, the official said. Separately, the US State Department said it would close its embassy in Kyiv after it \"received specific information of a potential significant air attack on 20 November\".\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, the embassy will be closed, and embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,\" it said in a statement, external. \"The US embassy recommends US citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.\" The embassy has previously issued similar warnings of potential air attacks at New Year and around Ukraine's Independence Day in August. The Italian and Greek embassies said they were also closing temporarily following the US warning. Ukraine's defence intelligence alleged that warnings of large scale missile strikes on Ukrainian cities were being spread by Russia as part of a \"massive information and psychological attack against Ukraine\". The government agency urged Ukrainians to only trust information from official sources and not to ignore air raid signals. Overnight, both Ukraine and Russia reported major drone attacks on their respective territories. It was not immediately known whether there were any casualties.\n\nThe provision of anti-personnel land mines is the latest move by the outgoing US administration to bolster Ukraine's war effort before Donald Trump returns to the White House on 20 January. For Ukraine's forces trying to halt Russian advances up and down the long front line in the east, mines are vital. Russia's tactics currently involve sending small groups of soldiers - sometimes no more than three to five men - to walk or ride motorbikes behind Ukrainian positions. These men are often killed or captured. However, in besieged towns like Chasiv Yar and Kurakhove, Ukrainian analysts say squads will sometimes be sent out every 20 minutes for hours at a time, creating problems for Ukrainian troops. \"It's very difficult to deal with,\" Serhiy Kuzan from the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre told the BBC. \"We need more anti-personnel mines.\" Much of the fighting is taking place in rural parts of the Donbas, wooded areas between huge open areas of farmland. With much of the civilian population already evacuated, Ukraine argues that the tactical use of \"non-persistent\" mines poses minimal risk to civilians and is absolutely essential to stem Russia's advance.\n\nRussia has deployed landmines liberally since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 but international objections to the use of such weapons on the grounds that they pose a risk to civilians had prevented the Biden administration from signing off on them. The US defence official confirmed to the BBC that Ukraine had pledged to use only mines that remained active for a limited period of time. The US \"non-persistent\" mines differ from Russia's as they become inert after a pre-set period of time - anywhere from four hours to two weeks. They are electrically fused and require battery power to detonate. Once the battery runs out, they will not detonate. Washington has already been providing anti-tank mines to Ukraine, but the anti-personnel land mines - which can be rapidly deployed - are designed to blunt the advances of ground forces. Russia and the US are not signatories to the Ottawa Convention banning the use or transfer of anti-personnel landmines, although Ukraine is. However, since Russia's full-scale invasion, more than 20% of Ukrainian territory is estimated to have become contaminated by mines. Earlier, it was confirmed that US-made longer-range Army Tactical Missile System (Atacms) missiles had struck targets inside Russia only days after reports emerged that the White House had granted permission for their use. Russia's defence ministry said the strike had targeted the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine to the north on Tuesday morning. It said five missiles had been shot down and one had caused damage - with its fragments starting a fire at a military facility. But two US officials said initial indications suggested Russia had intercepted just two missiles out of around eight fired by Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify independently the contradicting figures. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of trying to escalate the conflict. The Kremlin has vowed to retaliate. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved changes to Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, setting out new conditions under which the country would consider using its arsenal. It now says an attack from a non-nuclear state, if backed by a nuclear power, will be treated as a joint assault on Russia. Commenting on the changes, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: \"Since the beginning of its war of aggression against Ukraine, [Russia] has sought to coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behaviour.\" Additional reporting by Paul Adams, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Dnipro, Ukraine",
    "Local people had no idea the coral was there\n\nThe largest coral ever recorded has been found by scientists in the southwest Pacific Ocean. The mega coral - which is a collection of many connected, tiny creatures that together form one organism rather than a reef - could be more than 300 years old. It is bigger than a blue whale, the team say. It was found by a videographer working on a National Geographic ship visiting remote parts of the Pacific to see how it has been affected by climate change.\n\n\u201cI went diving in a place where the map said there was a shipwreck and then I saw something,\u201d said Manu San Felix. He called over his diving buddy, who is also his son Inigo, and they dived further down to inspect it. Seeing the coral, which is in the Solomon Islands, was like seeing a \"cathedral underwater\", he said. \"It's very emotional. I felt this huge respect for something that's stayed in one place and survived for hundreds of years,\" he said. \"I thought, 'Wow, this was here when Napoleon was alive',\" he added. Scientists on the expedition measured the coral using a type of tape measure under water. It is 34m wide, 32m long and 5.5m high. Globally coral is facing severe pressures as oceans warm with climate change. Corals are made of hundreds of thousands of living organisms called polyps, each with its own body and mouth, which grow together as a colony. Some corals grow hard, outer skeletons and when many of these fuse together they form a coral reef. Some of these reefs can extend for huge distances, forming vast structures where fish and other species live. Coral reefs also underpin the livelihoods of one billion people including by supporting tourism or fishing, according to the World Economic Forum., external\n\nScientists say the newly discovered coral is in good health\n\nThis specimen was found in deeper waters than some coral reefs, which may have protected it from higher temperatures at the sea surface. The discovery was announced at the same time as the UN climate talks COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan that are trying to make progress in tackling climate change. Mr Trevor Manemahaga, climate minister for the Solomon Islands at the summit, told BBC News that his nation would be proud of the newly-found coral. \"We want the world to know that this is a special place and it needs to be protected,\" he said. \"We rely mostly on marine resources for economic survival so coral is very, very important [...] And it's very crucial and critical for our economy to make sure our coral is not exploited,\" he said. Small island nations like the Solomon Islands are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Mr Manemahaga said he\u2019s seen first-hand the effects of global warming on his nation, as it causes more powerful cyclones and erodes the coastline causing homes to fall into the water.\n\nScientists calculated the age of the coral by measuring its growth\n\nMany developing countries at the talks are calling for more cash from richer nations to help them pay for their strategies to tackle climate change. Mr Manemahaga said that more finance for the Solomon Islands would help the country create more varied jobs that would mean fewer people worked in industries that damage coral reefs. Currently logging is a major part of the country's economy - between 50-70% of the country's annual export revenue, external - but it causes high levels of water pollution that damages coral in the area. Eric Brown, who is a coral scientist on the National Geographic research trip, says that the health of the coral was \"looking pretty good\". \u201cWhile the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" he said. The coral is a species called Pavona clavus and provides a home to shrimp, crabs, fish and other marine creatures. The age of the specimen also means it acts like a window into the history into oceanic conditions in the past. Scientists hope to study it to learn more about how it has grown. A report this week found that 44% of corals living in warm waters are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. That is an increase of a third since the species were last assessed in 2008.",

    "A Married at First Sight groom has admitted he made a \"massive mistake\" during his time on the Channel 4 reality show. Caspar Todd, a gardener from the New Forest, married Emma Barnes, a complete stranger that he had been matched with by a panel of experts. He was heavily criticised both online and on the show for telling his new bride during their honeymoon that he had \"rarely gone for the curvier person\". Mr Todd told BBC Radio Solent that he had apologised \"thousands of times\" and would keep on apologising as \"you don't say something like that\".\n\nThe ninth season of MAFS UK is currently being broadcast on E4\n\nHe described their whole honeymoon in Jamaica as a \"very bizarre situation\" and said he was \"feeling quite alone\" and was just \"trying to work out where the spark's coming from\". Married at First Sight is a social experiment, where single people marry total strangers, meeting for the first time at the altar. The weddings on the show are not legally binding. In 2018, former contestants from Love Island and Geordie Shore warned about the impact being on a reality TV show can have on mental health. They urged producers behind such programmes to offer better support to their contestants. But Caspar praised the support he has received from the show's welfare team, who he said have been in touch with him while the programme airs. \"Every day I have a call from the welfare team from Channel 4 and I also have access to a psych as well and they're fantastic,\" he said. \"So if I really am struggling, and I'm not going to lie when you're thrust into it, and then everyone starts knowing who you are and you're being recognised in Tesco and that sort of stuff, it becomes quite a lot. \"So having that support network behind you, who are going to just pick up a phone to you and say yep, we'll sort you out, it's been great.\"\n\nThe show is still being broadcast so Caspar cannot say whether things worked out in the end with his wife Emma. But he was clear on one thing, he was unlikely to be popping up again on our screens anytime soon. \"No,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I probably wouldn't do reality TV again - given the option.\"\n\nDo you have a story BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight should cover?",
    "The Daily Telegraph, external says Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told farmers she will not be reversing plans, announced in the Budget, to bring in inheritance tax on farms worth more than a million pounds.\n\nIn a statement, Reeves says the reforms are necessary to, in her words, \"ensure that wealthier estates and the most valuable farms pay their fair share to invest in our schools and health services\". But the papers notes that a first Labour peer has now criticised the government over the plans. Baroness Mallalieu said Labour had become an \"urban party\" divorced from much of the rural community.\n\nThe Sun, external says Jeremy Clarkson, who is recovering from a heart operation, will join up to 20,000 farmers marching in Westminster in protest at what the paper calls \"the hated tractor tax\".\n\nThe Guardian, external, the Telegraph, external and the Times, external all highlight Sir Keir Starmer's comments about Ukraine, after President Biden's decision to allow Kyiv to use long-range US missiles to strike deep into Russia. All three papers suggest the move may be too little, too late to alter the course of the war.\n\nThe Daily Mirror, external notes that the UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. But it also suggests the UK should not underestimate the possible consequences of following Washington and allowing Ukraine to use its long-range weapons on Russia too.\n\nThe Times reports that the British Retail Consortium letter warning, external of job losses because of the government's tax plans is the first time many of the companies have gone public with their concerns. It says that the Treasury tried to discourage several of the business from signing the letter, though it gives no further detail.\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, external, the Business Secretary has suggested that if Donald Trump were to spark a trade war with China, Britain would be likely to side with the European Union rather than the US. There are fears that Mr Trump could ask US trading partners such as the UK to follow his reported plans to slap tariffs on Chinese imports, which could put the UK at odds with Brussels.\n\nJonathan Reynolds said because the UK's bilateral trade with the EU outweighed that with the US, London would have to consider the consequences of an adverse relationship with Europe.\n\nThe Times, external and the Daily Mail, external both have more on - in their words - the IT \"meltdown\" at British Airways. The Mail calls it \"chaos\", and says dozens of flights were disrupted by the major technological glitch, leaving thousands of passengers standing in the cold waiting to board flights.

    "'We are dying every moment' - the Afghans risking their lives to reach UK\n\nAzaan has tried to leave Afghanistan three times since the Taliban seized power\n\nThe first time Azaan made the jump across the wall, he broke his arm. Braving the 20ft (6m) drop into a wide trench below is, for many Afghans, the only way to cross into Turkey from Iran - and yet hundreds risk it each day. \u201cI was in severe pain,\u201d the former Afghan army officer told the BBC. \u201cSeveral others had broken limbs. The smuggler left us here and told us to run in the direction of the lights of Van city. Many of us were fading out of hunger. I fainted.\u201d The wall - which stretches for nearly 300km (185 miles) - was built to prevent illegal crossings, and is patrolled constantly by Turkish border forces. Jumping off it is among the first of a series of extraordinary risks Afghan migrants take as they cross continents, countries and seas to reach the UK and other countries in Europe. Over the past year, fleeing their country has become more perilous than ever before for Afghans, because Pakistan, Iran and Turkey have intensified their crackdown on illegal migration from Afghanistan along their borders, and have also carried out mass deportations. Azaan couldn\u2019t continue. He was in pain, and had barely eaten in days. The migrants were given just one boiled egg every morning and a cup of rice in the evening by smugglers who\u2019d charged them nearly $4,000 (\u00a33,150) for the journey to Europe. \u201cI had two friends \u2013 we had made a promise to not leave each other,\u201d he says. His friends tied scarves around him, hoisted him up the wall, back into Iran. Iranian police deported him to Afghanistan. It was Azaan\u2019s second failed attempt. The first time he returned from the Afghanistan-Iran border because he\u2019d taken his wife and young children along, and he realised they wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the journey. Azaan didn\u2019t give up. Roughly a year later, once his arm had healed, he made a third attempt. \u201cI had sold my house earlier. This time I sold my wife\u2019s jewellery,\u201d he says.\n\nAfghans wait to attempt to cross into Turkey, in a still from a video sent to the BBC by a people smuggler\n\nIn exchange for the money, migrants like Azaan are promised a route to Europe, handed over from one people smuggler to another along the way. Back at the wall, the smuggler placed a ladder on the Iranian side, and cut the razor wire at the top to create a path for migrants. \u201cThere were 60 to 70 of us,\" Azaan recalls. \"We climbed to the top and then the smuggler told us to jump.\u201d For the law and politics graduate, who served his country and led a dignified, comfortable life until August 2021 when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, it is a humiliating situation to be in. In its three years in power, the Taliban government has imposed increasing, brutal restrictions on women. According to the UN, a third of the country\u2019s people don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from. And those who worked for the former military fear reprisal. \u201cThe people I fought against for 20 years are now in power,\" he explains. \"Our lives are in danger. My daughter won\u2019t be able to study once she turns 13. And I have no work. I\u2019ll continue to try to leave even if it costs me my life. \"Here we are dying every moment. It\u2019s better to die once, for good.\"\n\nIn this still from a video sent to the BBC by the people smuggler, wire at the top of the wall is cut through\n\nAzaan is now back in Kabul with his family. The third attempt to flee ended with a beating and deportation. \u201cThey beat me with the butt of a gun. One boy was hit on his genitals. He was in a terrible state. An old man\u2019s leg was broken. There was a corpse in the trenches in Turkey. This is what I saw. But Iran is also treating us badly. I know Afghans have been severely beaten in Iran too,\u201d he says. After weeks of digging through people smuggling networks, the BBC established contact with an Afghan smuggler in Iran, aiming to get an insight into the increased dangers Afghans are facing. \u201cIranian police are shooting a lot at the border with Afghanistan. One of my friends was killed recently,\u201d the smuggler says, speaking to us over the phone from Iran. In October, Iran was accused of firing indiscriminately at Afghans crossing over into Iran\u2019s Sistan province from Balochistan in Pakistan. The UN has raised concerns and called for an investigation. The BBC has seen and verified videos of the dead and injured. Sistan-Balochistan is one of the major routes taken by Afghan migrants to enter Iran, but given the increased risks as well as Pakistan\u2019s mass deportation of Afghans, many are now opting for other routes, in particular, Islam Qala in Afghanistan\u2019s Herat province. Once in Iran, migrants move to Tehran before going towards the Macu or Khoy counties, to attempt the crossing into Turkey, handed over from one smuggler to another.\n\nThe Afghan smuggler says he hides migrants near the border wall, and then they wait until there\u2019s less patrolling of a portion of the border wall to take a shot at the \u201cgame\u201d. He carries a ladder, and a wire cutter to cut the razor wire at the top of the wall and make a path for migrants. He says crossings have become extremely challenging in recent months. \u201cThe Turkish police catch 100 to 150 migrants every night. They have no mercy on them. They break their arms and legs,\u201d he says. The BBC has put the allegations to the governments of Turkey and Iran but has not yet received a response. We asked the smuggler how he can justify his illegal business which endangers the lives of Afghans, while charging them thousands of dollars. \u201cWe don\u2019t force people to take these risks. We tell them that whether they get to their destination is 99% in God\u2019s hands, and they could get killed or imprisoned. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m guilty. What are we supposed to do when people tell us their family is going hungry in Afghanistan?\u201d the smuggler says. Those who make it past Turkish security forces move from Van towards Kayseri city and then to the Izmir, Canakkale or Bodrum coasts - the next point of peril on the migrant trail.\n\nIn Kabul, an elderly father took us to the grave of his son. In his twenties, Javid was a former soldier. Fearing for his life in Taliban controlled Afghanistan, he fled the country in an attempt to make it to the UK. In March this year, he was among 22 people killed after the rubber dinghy they were in sank in the Aegean sea near Canakkale in Turkey, as they attempted to get to Greece. His pregnant wife was also among the 46 people squeezed on to the boat. They both managed to swim to the shore, but he died of hypothermia. \u201cFrom Istanbul, smugglers took us to Esenyurt. From there we were packed into cars like animals. We were dropped off in a forested area. We walked through it for four hours and then we reached the coast from where we were put on the boat,\u201d Javid\u2019s wife says, speaking to us over the phone from Turkey where she\u2019s still living.\n\nJavid's father feels betrayed and abandoned by the countries which fought in Afghanistan\n\nIn Kabul, Javid\u2019s father broke down inconsolably as he showed us photos of the young man with short black hair wearing track pants and a sweatshirt, posing on a park bench. \u201cEven now when I remember him the grief is such that it\u2019s only with God's blessing that I survive the torment,\u201d he says. He believes that foreign countries which fought in Afghanistan bear responsibility for what is happening to Afghans like his son. \u201cWe fought alongside them in the war against terrorism. If we had known we would be betrayed and abandoned, no one would have agreed to join hands with foreign forces.\u201d According to the UN, Afghans are among the top asylum seekers in the world, and in the UK they are the second largest group arriving in the country in small boats, another journey fraught with peril. The UK has two resettlement schemes for Afghans. One is for Afghans who worked directly for the British military and British government, and under the second scheme \u2013 the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) - those who assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan, stood up for values of democracy, women\u2019s freedoms and people at risk can be eligible for relocation. But after the first phase of evacuation in 2021-22, progress has been extremely slow.\n\nShahida made it to the UK and has applied for asylum\n\nThis means women like Shahida, who worked in the former parliament of Afghanistan and participated in street protests against the Taliban after they seized power, could not find timely legal routes out of the country. Shahida feared the threat of detention and torture by the Taliban government in Afghanistan every day. She arrived in the UK in a small boat in May this year, having begun the journey out of Afghanistan more than two years ago. Now in Liverpool, she has applied for asylum. \u201cI come from a well-known and well-respected family. I\u2019ve never done anything illegal in my life. When authorities would apprehend us during the journey, I would look down out of shame,\u201d she says. Shahida describes how she crossed the English Channel on an inflatable dinghy, packed in with 64 people. This year has been the deadliest year for migrant crossings across the Channel. More than 50 people have died. \u201cThere was water up to my waist. And because our guide lost the way we floated for hours. I thought this was going to be the end of my life. I\u2019m diabetic so I had to urinate sitting there. And because I was thirsty I had to drink the water I had urinated in. Can you imagine? In Kabul I had everything. My whole life has been taken away from me because the Taliban took over,\u201d she says. Back in Kabul, Azaan, the former military officer, now wants to sell a small patch of land, the only asset he has left, to gather money to make another attempt. \u201cThis is the only purpose of my life now, to get myself to a safer place.\u201d All names have been changed.",
    "Dominican Republic 'to deport up to 10,000 migrants a week'\n\nHaitian migrants in a lorry belonging to the immigration enforcement service of the Dominican Republic after being transported to Haiti\n\nThe Dominican Republic says it plans to deport up to 10,000 undocumented migrants a week to combat uncontrolled migration. The plan was announced by President Luis Abinader's spokesman, Homero Figueroa, who blamed the international community's slow response to months of gang violence in neighbouring Haiti and its failure to restore stability. Tens of thousands of Haitians have fled across the border into the Dominican Republic. Critics say the government of President Abinader has treated Haitian migrants inhumanely, many of whom are fleeing the extreme gang violence and poverty in the capital Port-au-Prince.\n\nMr Figueroa said deportations would begin immediately and follow strict protocols that guaranteed respect for human rights. The comments by the Dominican government\u2019s spokesman suggest the rate of deportations of undocumented Haitians is about to ramp up significantly. Since gang violence in Haiti has worsened in recent months, the Dominican authorities have steadily been returning Haitians over their shared land border including several truckloads of people per day at the border crossing at Dajabon. Now, said Mr Figueroa, that figure could reach as many as 10,000 people a week. He spoke of what he called an \u201cexcess\u201d of Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic and said the border authorities would also increase their surveillance and control. The Dominican president recently warned the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly that his government was prepared to take what he called \u201cdrastic measures\u201d in the face of the humanitarian crisis across the border. In part, these latest comments about mass deportations underline Santo Domingo\u2019s frustration at the international community\u2019s failure to establish greater stability in Haiti. A Kenyan-led international security force of around 400 officers has been deployed to the Caribbean nation. However, gangs still control most of the capital and the humanitarian emergency in terms of hunger, access to clean drinking water and medical attention remains critical. According to the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM), last year the Dominican Republic forcibly returned more than 200,000 people to Haiti.",
    "Iran leader says Israeli attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed'\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has given a measured response to Israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be \"exaggerated or downplayed\" while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation. President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would \"give an appropriate response\" to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that Tehran did not seek war. Israel said it targeted military sites in several regions of Iran on Saturday in retaliation for Iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had crippled Iranian air defence and missile production systems. He said the strikes had \"severely damaged Iran\u2019s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles\".\n\n\"The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals,\" Netanyahu said at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 October attacks. \"This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him.\" Official Iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems. In his first public comments since the attack, Khamenei said: \"It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country.\" President Pezeshkian largely echoed the supreme leader's language, telling a cabinet meeting: \"We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country.\" The Israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. The US had publicly pressured Israel not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by Tel Aviv. The Iranian foreign minister said on Sunday that Iran had \"received indications\" about an impending attack hours before it took place. \"We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night,\" Abbas Araghchi told reporters, without going into more detail. Western countries have urged Iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both Middle Eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war. Iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the \"limited\" damage as a victory, a choice analysts said was intended to reassure Iranians.\n\nFighting continued between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the town of Sidon in southern Lebanon killed at least eight people, according to local authorities. Late on Sunday Lebanon said at least 21 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on the south of the country. In Gaza, nine people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the al-Shati refugee camp, Palestinians officials said. Palestinian media and the Reuters news agency said three of the dead were Palestinian journalists, citing government officials. And in Israel, a man was killed and at least 30 injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv, in what authorities said was a suspected terror attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, which would involve an exchange of four Israeli hostages for some Palestinian prisoners. He said that within 10 days of implementing such a temporary ceasefire, talks should resume with the aim of reaching a more permanent one. But speaking to the BBC's Arabic Service, a senior Hamas official said its conditions for a ceasefire - rejected by Israel for months - have not changed. Sami Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian militant group continued to demand a complete ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a serious prisoner swap deal. \"Any agreement that does not guarantee these conditions holds no value,\" he added. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,924 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

He scorned what he called \"the beautiful people\" - the men in smart suits with red roses and mobile phones who became the new face of Labour. Yet he was an important figure in the campaign to sell modernisation to the party and pave the way for Labour to regain power after 18 years in opposition with Tony Blair's historic landslide victory in 1997. Towards the end of his political career, a series of embarrassments - including an affair and allegations of ministerial impropriety - threatened to tarnish his salt-of-the-earth image. But as deputy prime minister for 10 years and part of the team that won three successive election victories, his position in Labour history is secure.\n\nJohn Leslie Prescott was born in Prestatyn, then in Flintshire, on 31 May 1938. His father was a railway signalman and his mother came from a mining family. Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.\n\nHe was one of a number of union-sponsored Labour MPs\n\nHe became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen. In 1962, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he got a diploma in economics and politics, and later to Hull University to study for an economics degree. Active in the merchant sailors' strike of 1966, he served as an official with the National Union of Seamen for two years before his election, in 1970, as MP for Hull East, sponsored by the union.\n\nJohn Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport. The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea. But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.\n\nHe swam a stretch of the Thames to protest against dumping nuclear waste at sea\n\nIt was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again. And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years. When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.\n\nJohn Prescott was a key figure in New Labour's rise to power and its decade in government\n\nThe Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment. He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car. This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.\n\nHe had a love-hate relationship with some of his colleagues, most notably Peter Mandelson, whom he once compared to a crab\n\nHe played an invaluable role as peacemaker between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\n\nIn typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about. But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press. He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers. He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.\n\nHis policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea. He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes. As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.\n\nHis showmanship came to the fore on the campaign trail\n\nHis passion and burly style of delivery were constant features. He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept. Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit. \"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Moment Prescott punched protester who threw egg at him\n\nHe hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire. John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.\n\nIn later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed. His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet. And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified. However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life. In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.\n\nImages of the former union official playing croquet at his grace-and-favour residence were a gift to satirists\n\nIn a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes. But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation. It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino. Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films. The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.\n\nShortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy. He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure. To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\" He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning. He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.\n\nHe was in his element on the campaign trail, throwing his weight behind No in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum\n\nHis most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal. For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International. He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner. He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.\n\nWhile ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him. He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election. He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him. His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team. And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future. In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\". To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "\u00a315 jeans 'more durable' than \u00a3150 pair in tests\n\nThe testing will determine Primark's quality and durability guidelines\n\nCheap clothes have outperformed more expensive garments in durability testing conducted for the discount fashion industry. The University of Leeds has worked with retailer Primark to test items such as jeans and T-shirts to set \"standards\" on how long clothing should last. The university's school of design assessed 65 products, and found a \u00a315 pair of women's jeans to be more durable than their \u00a3150 equivalent. Primark will incorporate the findings of the study into its guidelines and the chain said it hoped the results would help give customers better value for their money.\n\nKate Morris, who led the research team at the university, said: \"We have equipment that can mimic years and years of wear and tear of garments in a matter of hours. \u201cWe had to consider how the garments are actually used. So, with jeans we focussed on things such as the fabric rubbing together and seam strength. \u201cFor hoodies we look at pilling, which are the small bobbles that form on fabric.\u201d And the team were \"surprised\" by the results, which showed that price was not necessarily an indicator of long-term quality. The second-best performer in the men's T-shirt category cost only \u00a35. Seventeen styles were tested. Ms Morris added: \u201cHistorically people think that if you pay more, you\u2019ll get a longer life out of the garment. \u201cWe found no correlation between price and durability. It doesn\u2019t mean that if you go out and buy something really cheap it will last forever, and vice versa. We are simply saying that there is no correlation between the two\u201d.\n\nKate Morris from the University of Leeds led the testing for Primark\u2019s durability project\n\nPrimark, which has faced repeated criticism for its \"fast fashion\" approach, said it hoped its new Durability Framework would help people get more wear from their purchases. Speaking exclusively to BBC Radio 4\u2019s You and Yours programme, Vicki Swain, Primark\u2019s product longevity lead, said: \u201cWe developed the framework to ensure that customers know items are going to last, no matter how much they can afford to spend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been investing in making our clothes more durable and also making them with more sustainable materials.\" Primark supplied the garments for the study but had no further input in the independent research. Ms Morris said: \u201cWe did all of the testing, analysed all of the data, created a testing framework and fed that data back to Primark. \u201cThey were not involved in any of the testing work.\u201d She added that the University of Leeds planned to conduct more of its own studies to determine what factors cause clothes to last. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot more research to find out what dictates durability within a garment, but that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve found out yet.\u201d Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here, external.",
    "Time has come for reparations dialogue, Commonwealth heads agree\n\nCommonwealth leaders have agreed the \"time has come\" for a conversation about reparations for the slave trade, despite the UK's desire to keep the subject off the agenda at a two-day summit in Samoa. A document signed by 56 heads of government, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, acknowledges calls for \"discussions on reparatory justice\" for the \"abhorrent\" transatlantic slave trade. The statement says it is time for a \"meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation\". Sir Keir said there had been no discussions about money at the meeting, and that the UK is \"very clear\" in its position that it would not pay reparations.\n\nThe UK has faced growing calls from Commonwealth leaders to apologise and pay reparations for the country\u2019s historical role in the slave trade. Reparations for the benefit of those who suffered as a result of slavery could take many forms, from financial to symbolic. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street had insisted the issue would not be on the agenda. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Sir Keir said Commonwealth leaders had a \"positive two days\" in Samoa and downplayed the prominence of reparations at the summit. \"The dominant theme of the two days has been resilience and climate,\" he said, adding that the section of the joint statement discussing reparations amounts to \"one paragraph in 20-something paragraphs\". \"None of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that,\" he said. Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the UK would not pay reparations for slavery.\n\nBefore the statement was released, the leaders' conclave \u2013 where commonwealth prime ministers and presidents meet without advisers \u2013 went on for about six hours. The prime minister said it was not the conversation about reparations that had caused it to run on for so long. One Downing Street source told the BBC: \"We\u2019ve been clear on our position and it\u2019s not changing.\" And they have and it hasn\u2019t \u2013 in fact the direct nature of their remarks about reparations on the way to the summit irritated some of those countries campaigning on it. Half of the art of diplomacy is to keep things you want to talk about being talked about \u2013 keeping the conversation going, even if the prospect of imminent change is unlikely. For those who think the time has come for countries like the UK to face up to their pasts, the communique allows them to say the conversation continues. For the UK and others, they can say their position isn\u2019t changing and also point to a range of other topics \u2013 trade, climate change and security for instance \u2013 that, they argue, the Commonwealth offers a vital forum for. However, the prime minister did appear to leave the door open for further discussions about some form of reparatory justice, saying the \"next opportunity to look at this\" would be at the UK-Caribbean forum. Frederick Mitchell, the foreign minister of the Bahamas, said leaders hoped to come up with a \"comprehensive report\" on the issue at that forum, to be held in London next March. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he expected the UK would eventually pay financial reparations to Caribbean countries. Challenged on whether the wording of the joint statement was too vague, he said: \"Behind the language is an attempt to go in a particular direction.\" Diplomats have said they expect reparatory justice to be a central focus of the agenda for the next Commonwealth summit in two years\u2019 time. Last year, a UN judge said the UK likely owed more than \u00a318tn in reparations for its role in slavery in 14 Caribbean countries. But reparatory justice could also take the form of a formal apology, educational programmes or public health assistance. One person who supports reparations is the incoming Commonwealth secretary general, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, who was appointed on Friday. She is currently serving as Ghana's foreign minister, and has also backed the drafting of a Commonwealth free trade agreement, according to AFP. In a statement, Botchwey said she was \"truly humbled\" but emphasised that \"work indeed lies ahead\".",
    "Former member of the Royal Navy, Sophie Brook said she hoped the report would be the starting point for change\n\nWomen in the Submarine Service have suffered misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours, a Royal Navy investigation has found. This behaviour was seen \"amongst all ranks\" but was \"not pervasive\" across the service, the report said, after a two-year-long investigation. Whistleblower Sophie Brook, who was a lieutenant, made claims about her treatment while serving with the Royal Navy, first prompting the review in 2022. Responding to the report's findings, she told the BBC this was a \"critical moment, not just for me, but for every woman and man who has suffered in silence.\" Navy chief, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key, said he was \"truly sorry\" to Ms Brook and any personnel past and present who had faced unacceptable behaviour.\n\nThe allegations investigated in the report were from a number of women not just Ms Brook and covered a period between 2014 and 2020. She had alleged that a culture of sexual assault, sexual harassment and misogyny was widespread within the Submarine Service. On Friday Ms Brook told the BBC she hoped the report was not just a \"token gesture\". \"The report highlights the systemic failures I, and many others, experienced first hand\u2014failures that left victims isolated, silenced, and often retaliated against for daring to speak up.\" She said she had come forward to \"shine a light on a culture that, for too long, has been permitted to thrive within some of the most elite branches of our armed forces.\" Ms Brook continued: \"No-one should have to endure the harassment, abuse, and mental toll that I and countless others have faced. \"The Royal Navy must take immediate action to ensure that no-one else is subjected to the same systemic misogyny and discrimination that has long plagued the Submarine Service.\" However she added that \"this fight is far from over\" to ensure in future submariners worked where there was \"respect, dignity, and equality.\" Adm Sir Ben said he had met Ms Brook and \"apologised to her personally and unreservedly\" as he praised her courage.\n\nFirst Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Ben Key\n\nParts of the published report are heavily redacted, meaning some details have been removed.

The XO - or second in command - allegedly told her to \"be quiet\" when she \"shouted about it\"\n\u2022 None A second in command regularly asked for sexual favours from a female member of staff and left \"naked pictures of models\" for her\n\u2022 None Reports that women were \"regularly screamed at\", and \"sniffing\" was rife, where men would \"follow the few women around\"\n\u2022 None Some captains have a \"Black Ops Hard Drive\" which was allegedly code for their porn collection\n\u2022 None Senior officers \"openly\" making \"sexual gestures\" to women in their command\n\u2022 None Reports of bras being stolen from the laundry while \"engineers would openly sniff women's used underwear\"\n\u2022 None When a female colleague asked to be excused for a medical appointment, one officer allegedly said if it was to attend a smear test they could \"all get together\" and perform a \"cervical exam\" on the wardroom table\n\nThere were also allegations that victims were discouraged from filing complaints of abuse, or they would face being branded \"dangerous girls\" or \"troublemakers\". Overall, the Navy said it had conducted 28 separate investigations leading to the discharge of 21 individuals, with four being reduced in rank and six facing disciplinary or administrative action. Of the total discharged three were in relation to Ms Brook's complaints. The investigation has not led to any charges of sexual assault, but a number of individuals have been discharged from the Navy following the investigation. Some of the allegations were reported to the MoD\u2019s serious crime unit but the Navy said there was insufficient evidence to bring prosecutions. In a statement released on Friday, Sir Ben said the recommendations from the investigation had been accepted in full, including the establishment of a new head of culture, alongside changes to training in the Submarine Service. The admiral said that a number of measures were being taken to address what he has called \u201cappalling behaviours\u201d against women \u2013 who make up just over 10% of the service.\n\nIn the statement, Sir Ben continued: \"Poor practices and behaviours in the past that may have been normalized in some quarters should never have been considered acceptable, and they have no place today, we must institute a culture that does not allow space for this behaviour to exist, and we must deal with perpetrators swiftly, without fear or favour, which I can confirm we have now done.\u201d He added that the service \"must be better\" and \"do better than we have\". The investigation followed complaints of bullying and sexual harassment against women. One woman, who spent several months at sea on board Royal Navy warships, told the BBC about an incident in 2019 when an officer stuck his hand up her skirt while they were drinking in the Officer's Mess. When she protested and put a stop to things by announcing she was returning to her cabin, the officer followed her to her room and \"hammered on my door, condom in hand\", she said.",

    "Rebekah Morris, 29, was walking her dog through a field when she was trampled to death\n\nA woman sent a picture of cows in a field to her mother moments before she was trampled to death, an inquest has heard. Rebekah Morris had been walking her dog in fields off Riverside Way in Littlethorpe, Leicestershire, on the evening of 9 July 2022 when she sent the image with the caption \"cowz\". A jury inquest, which began on Monday at Leicester Town Hall, was told the 29-year-old's family, worrying at a lack of replies to their messages, went to the area to find her fatally injured. The inquest heard farmer Guy Hutton and other residents gave her CPR before emergency services arrived, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nForensic pathologist Michael Biggs told the inquest that Ms Morris - known to family and friends as Becki - had \"hoofprints\" to her chest and shoulder, and suffered an injury to her liver, which led to her death from internal bleeding.\n\nMs Morris's last message helped her family locate her\n\nInitial calls to emergency services were that a woman had been attacked or strangled, a paramedic who attended the scene told the hearing, but Dr Biggs's post-mortem examination found no evidence of another person's involvement. He said: \"The nature of the injuries and the severity of them are too excessive to have been caused by another person, they are consistent with a large heavy creature such as a cow.\" He added the number of injuries was \"not so large\" that he believed the whole herd had been involved, and instead thought it was a \"relatively brief incident involving one cow\". Toxicology reports showed Ms Morris had \"social level\" alcohol in her system alongside her prescribed medication, but Dr Biggs said any impact on her would have been \"mild\".\n\nMs Morris had taken her dog, a chihuahua called Zero, for a walk on the night she died\n\nPrior to the hearing, David Morris - Ms Morris's father - said his daughter was \"the sort of person that lit up the room when she walked into it\". He said: \"She was a wonderful, lovely girl. She was kind, had compassion, and always had a listening ear for anyone.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Leicester",
    "\"Let\u2019s be real, the war has started,\" a former minister tells me. \"What happens in the Middle East never stays in the Middle East.\"\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be moved by the burning conflict \u2013 the killing of Israelis by Hamas almost a year ago and agony of the families of hostages snatched; the killing of thousands of Gazans by Israel in its response and the terrible suffering there.\n\nAnd now Lebanon, where Israel has struck again after almost a year of cross-border hostilities, killing hundreds in air strikes against Hezbollah. Hundreds of thousands more civilians are on the move, desperate to find safety.\n\nBut it can feel bewildering, and far away. So why does it matter at home?\n\n\"There\u2019s the humanitarian horror,\" says a former diplomat. And of course there are many families in the UK worried about the safety of friends or relatives still in Lebanon, Israel and Gaza. There is a potential bump in the number of refugees likely to head for Europe from Lebanon if all-out war begins.\n\nThe conflict has stirred tensions here as well. \"We see it on our streets,\" the former minister says, whether that\u2019s at Gaza protests, the rise in antisemitism or even a handful of pro-Palestinian politicians winning seats in Parliament.\n\nIf - as US President Joe Biden has acknowledged in public - Israel goes ahead and hits Iran\u2019s oil industry, the costs could hit us all.",

    "Interpol has launched a campaign to identify a number of dead women\n\nA pair of red shoes, two beaded necklaces and a British 10p coin are among the few clues that could help to identify a teenage girl found murdered in western France more than 40 years ago. Her death is one of 46 cold cases European police are seeking to solve as part of the second phase of a campaign aimed at finding the names of unidentified murdered women. BBC coverage of last year\u2019s appeal helped to identify a British woman some 30 years after her murder. \u201cWe want to identify the deceased women, bring answers to families, and deliver justice to the victims,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Stock, secretary-general of Interpol, which is co-ordinating the effort, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWhether it is a memory, a tip, or a shared story, the smallest detail could help uncover the truth.\u201d The second phase of the Operation Identify Me campaign includes cases in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain.\n\nDetective Franc Dannerolle is hoping to find the family of a teenage woman whose body was discovered in France\n\nDetails of each one have been published on Interpol\u2019s website, along with photographs of possible identifying items and facial reconstructions. Most of the victims are thought to have been aged between 15 and 30. The body of the teenager with red shoes, beaded necklaces and a 10p piece was found underneath layers of leaves in a layby near a village called Le Cellier in 1982. It had been there for several months. Speaking near the area she was found, now overgrown with brambles, nettles and horse chestnut trees, detective Franc Dannerolle says the teenager\u2019s body was \u201cdisposed of like garbage\u201d. \u201cThere was no respect, no care for her before her death,\u201d he adds. The 10p coin led investigators to believe that she was either British or had been travelling in Britain before her murder, though they acknowledge that she could have found it, or been given it. Police have chosen not to go into detail about the nature of her killing to avoid \u201cfake perpetrators\u201d from claiming responsibility. Unfortunately, the teenager's remains can no longer be found, which complicates the cold case investigators' task. \u201cIf we manage to find them, it could be possible to work on her DNA to have a link with the family,\u201d says Det Dannerolle.\n\nAlain Brillet has described the case as a 'triple enigma'\n\nRetired detective Alain Brillet worked on the case at the time and describes it as a \u201ctriple enigma\u201d. \u201cThe strangest and most incredible thing was that we had someone who had been murdered, because we knew she had been murdered, but we could never find out what her name was, where she was from, or who had killed her,\u201d he says. The BBC found one woman who recalled the fear the discovery of her body sparked in the village, but because the victim wasn\u2019t local, most people forgot about it and moved on.\n\nInterpol has released sketches of women they are hoping to identify as part of the campaign\n\nThe launch of the Operation Identify Me campaign, external last year marked the first time that Interpol had ever gone public with a list known as \u201cblack notices\u201d, seeking information about unidentified bodies. Such notices had historically only been circulated internally among Interpol's network of police forces. Across Europe, the ease of movement due to open borders, increased global migration, and human trafficking has led to more people being reported missing outside their home country, says Dr Susan Hitchin, co-ordinator of Interpol's DNA unit. \u201cThese women have suffered a double injustice. They\u2019ve become victims twice: they\u2019ve been killed through an act of violence and they\u2019ve been denied their name in death,\u201d she says. Interpol is using targeted social media to advertise the campaign in specific locations and demographics. The global police force has also been asking celebrities to speak on behalf of the unknown, unnamed women. Another case that Interpol is hoping people may be able to help solve is that of a woman whose body was discovered in Wassenaar in the Netherlands some two decades ago. The discovery was Dutch forensic investigator Sandra Baasbank\u2019s first case. She remembers seeing the woman lying face down in sand dunes, with no obvious signs of injury or struggle.\n\nSandra Baasbank is hopeful that the Identify Me campaign will help bring new leads\n\nDet Baasbank says the woman was wearing brown plaid leggings and red shiny patent shoes \u2013 \u201cunusual if you are going for a walk on the beach\u201d. \u201cShe was very fit, sporty. Wearing a headband, and sunglasses. Her buttons were done up and she was wearing a scarf,\u201d the detective adds. Forensic analysis found the woman was born in Eastern Europe and spent the final five years of her life in Western Europe. One of the keys she was carrying was traced back to Germany. \u201cMaybe she made me better at what I do. \u2018Never give up,' is my motto. I\u2019m determined in the work I do, and maybe she\u2019s the reason why,\u201d Det Baasbank says. She is hopeful that the new Identify Me campaign will help ignite some new leads and provide a form of closure. And there is reason for her optimism.\n\nRita Roberts was successfully identified thanks to the campaign last year\n\nRita Roberts, a British woman murdered in Belgium, was identified when her family spotted her distinctive black rose tattoo in a BBC report based on the first appeal. The last contact her family had with her was via a postcard in May 1992. Her body was found the following month. When her family were told the body was indeed Rita, her sister Donna says she \u201cbroke into tears crying\u201d. For them, it had ended decades of uncertainty. While it has been hard learning of her sister\u2019s death, she says she takes comfort in feeling that Rita is \u201cat peace\u201d. Now she has been identified, her family are appealing to the public for any information however small to help with the investigation. And they\u2019re also hoping that other murdered women will also be identified. They are \u201csisters, mothers, aunties,\u201d Donna says. \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have names, don\u2019t assume they\u2019re not people.\u201d",
    "Kim (R) and Putin (L) toasted their friendship when they met in North Korea in June\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent a birthday message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him his \"closest comrade\". Kim, congratulating Putin on his 72nd birthday, added that relations between both countries would be raised to a new level. Relations between Pyongyang and Moscow have deepened since the start of the Ukraine war - in a move that has worried the West. Separately on Tuesday, Kim said Pyongyang would speed up steps to make his country a military super power with nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to Yonhap News quoting North Korean state media KCNA, Kim praised relations between both countries, saying they had become \"invincible and eternal\", since Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June. \"Meetings and comradely ties between us... will make a positive contribution to further consolidating the eternal foundation of the DPRK-Russia friendship,\" he added, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The relationship between North Korea and Russia goes back decades - to Stalin and Kim Il-sung, the current Kim's grandfather. The Soviet Union supported North Korea in its early days with weapons and technology, and Pyongyang has never wanted to completely rely on China - which it does not fully trust. Earlier this year, Putin and Kim signed an agreement pledging that they would help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country - though it was unclear what would constitute aggression. Kim has been accused of helping Russia in the war against Ukraine by supplying it with weapons in exchange for economic and technological assistance. There has been growing evidence that Russia has been deploying North Korean missiles in Ukraine. For Putin, the relationship is likely more tactical than strategic. He needs support for his war in Ukraine and North Korea will certainly be willing to sell him whatever munitions he is willing to pay for. Jeffrey Lewis, a director at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, had earlier said both Kim and Putin were \"trying to reduce the pain of international sanctions by creating an alternate network of friends and partners beyond the reach of US sanctions\". North Korea certainly can benefit enormously from access to Russian military technology \u2013 which despite Russia\u2019s problems is still far more advanced than North Korea\u2019s homegrown and reverse-engineered systems. North Korea is primarily trying to perfect its nuclear and missile arsenal. It has made very surprising progress in the last decade in producing new missile systems and miniaturising its nuclear devices. But Russia has far more advanced thermonuclear warhead designs, re-entry vehicle designs and solid rocket motor designs. During a visit by Kim to Russia in September 2023, Putin had promised to help North Korea develop its satellites, after several failed launches by Pyongyang. A South Korean lawmaker also separately on Tuesday claimed that Seoul's military had detected apparent signs that North Korea had started to build a possible nuclear-powered submarine. Citing Korea's intelligence agency, Rep Kang Dae-sik said construction was still in its early stages and \"further confirmation is needed on whether it is nuclear powered\".",
    "All NI children could get free school meals\n\nProviding a free dinner for all school children could cost over \u00a3200m a year\n\nAll school pupils in Northern Ireland could receive a free school meal under plans published by the Department of Education (DE). But providing a free dinner for all school children could cost over \u00a3200m a year. Providing a free meal to primary school children only or just younger children would cost less. The department has published a consultation on free meals and uniform grants which includes the figures.\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan recently introduced a free lunch for every pupil at the city's state primary schools. In Wales, all primary school children automatically get a free school meal but eligible secondary pupils still have to apply. In September the Scottish government ditched a commitment to expand free school meals to all primary school pupils. The Department of Education in Northern Ireland previously scrapped a grant to help parents pay for food costs during school holidays.\n\nPaul Givan's department has set out the costs of changing eligibility criteria for free meals\n\nEducation Minister Paul Givan is reviewing the eligibility criteria for free school meals and school uniform grants. Uniform grants are currently \u00a342.90 for a primary school pupil and a maximum of \u00a393.60 for a post-primary pupil. His department is already looking at whether a price cap should be introduced for school uniforms in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, a family is eligible for free school meals and a uniform grant if they receive universal credit and their household income is up to \u00a315,000 per year, after tax. If families receive other benefits like income support, jobseeker's allowance, or employment and support allowance they should also be eligible. About 94,000 pupils - over a quarter of the school population - are currently entitled to free school meals. Givan is exploring if more young people could be entitled to free meals and uniform grants, and how much that would cost his department. Among the options the department has scoped are to give a free meal to every child up to and including primary three, primary seven or to every child in primary and post-primary school. According to the department, free school meals could improve a child's \"ability to concentrate and learn in school based on them having a nutritionally balanced lunch and establishing positive eating habits\".\n\nProviding universal free school meals to all pupils to primary three would cost about \u00a346m a year, while to provide it to all pupils to primary seven would cost \u00a3103m a year. To provide a free meal to all school pupils regardless of income would cost \u00a3202m a year. The department has also looked at raising the household income up to which a family would qualify for free meals or a uniform grant to \u00a320,000. But its consultation on the plans said that there were \"very severe pressures on the education budget\". \"An increase in the number of pupils able to access a free school meal would not be affordable from within the current education budget and would require additional funding if any changes are to be implemented,\" it said. The number of children living in poverty in Northern Ireland has increased in recent years. The Assembly's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) recently called the Department for Communities' handling of the Child Poverty Strategy a \"catalogue of failures,\" where children and families are not at its heart. The consultation on free school meals and uniform grants runs until 14 February 2025.",
    "Alex Salmond launched fresh legal action against the Scottish government in November 2023\n\nThe acting leader of the Alba Party says he hopes Alex Salmond's legal case against the Scottish government continues after his death. Kenny MacAskill said the decision was for the former's first minister's family to make but that he would support court action to expose alleged wrongdoing. Salmond was in the process of suing the Scottish government over a botched investigation into harassment complaints when he died of a heart attack on Saturday. The government previously vowed to defend itself \"robustly\" in court.\n\nSalmond's close friend David Davis, a Conservative MP, has also vowed to secure \"justice\" for the ex-SNP leader. In November last year, Salmond lodged a Court of Session petition seeking a reported \u00a33m in damages and loss of earnings. He had already been awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in costs by the Scottish government over the mishandling of harassment complaints against him. The former first minister, who launched Alba in 2021, was also cleared of sexual assault charges at a subsequent criminal trial.\n\nKenny MacAskill has stepped in as acting Alba leader following Alex Salmond's sudden death\n\nMacAskill, an ex-SNP cabinet colleague of Salmond, said he would support the legal action if the family decided to push forward with it. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: \"My own position is that I will respect whatever the family decide. \"But I would certainly hope and I believe that they are likely to continue this, because that court case will expose, I believe, malfeasance amongst individuals and institutions that really has to be brought out to allow history to properly remember Alex Salmond.\" The former first minster has sued the government for misfeasance \u2013 a civil law term that means the wrongful exercise of lawful authority. After someone dies, the executors of their estate are able to pursue claims for past damages. However, if they lost the case, the estate could be liable for legal costs. An executor could also be personally liable for making a decision which no reasonable executor would. Dr Nick McKerrell, a senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: \"A legal action like this, which is very unusual, and has never really been successful before in Scotland, would cost a lot of money. \"And it\u2019s whether the executors of Alex Salmond\u2019s will think that is a proper use of his funds to continue the action.\" He said the legal action could continue, adding: \"But such a personal action in terms of the evidence that would have been required to be given by Alex Salmond in the action, I\u2019m not sure that you could get a proper hearing for this case.\u201d\n\nSalmond was claiming damages for injury to him \u2013 not physical injury, but an alleged loss of earnings due to his treatment by the government. His lawyers claimed Holyrood officials acted \"improperly, in bad faith and beyond their powers with the intention of injuring\" the ex-SNP leader. His team said that they did not recognise the \u00a33m figure, but said the claim for damages and loss of income would be \u201csignificant\u201d. Salmond warned a \"day of reckoning\" was coming for the Scottish government as he named former first minister - and political protegee - Nicola Sturgeon and ex-permanent secretary Leslie Evans in the case, accusing both of misfeasance. At the time the case was launched, then-first minister Humza Yousaf said the government would defend itself \"robustly\". Sturgeon has repeatedly denied being part of a plot against Salmond, or that there was evidence of one existing at all. An initial hearing into the \"misfeasance\" action was heard at the Court of Session in November to lay the groundwork for a future case, which is yet to begin. The case has been postponed several times since November while separate investigations take place - including complaints Salmond has made about events around the original case, about leaks to the media and claims of perjury.\n\nConservative MP David Davis has raised questions about the government's treatment of Alex Salmond\n\nDavis, a former Conservative minister, said he had been due to meet Salmond for dinner on Sunday where they would have discussed his complaints. He said he wanted to see Holyrood given powers of privilege to allow it to investigate without fear of prosecution as he seeks \u201cproper answers to what exactly happened in the treatment of Alex Salmond\u201d. Davis told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that the legal issues had \"put a huge pall over the last several years of this great man's life and, who knows, it might even have accelerated his death\". He added: \u201cI want to see this exposed, opened up, so that the Scottish government is forced to answer the questions it ought to answer on this matter.\u201d A Scottish government spokesperson said it would not be appropriate to comment on live litigation.",
    "Sean 'Diddy' Combs faces more than 100 new assault allegations\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The youngest was nine years old, says alleged victims' lawyer Tony Buzbee\n\nMore than 100 people are to sue rap musician Sean 'Diddy' Combs for sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation, a US lawyer has said. Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee said that some of the alleged victims include minors who were abused when they were as young as nine years old. \"This is an important matter that we intend to aggressively pursue,\" Mr Buzbee told reporters. Erica Wolff, a lawyer representing Mr Combs, said the rapper \"emphatically and categorically\" denies the allegations, saying they are \"false and defamatory\".\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Buzbee said he and his team \u201cwill leave no stone unturned to find potentially liable parties\u201d in the alleged abuse, or \u201cany individual or entity who participated in or benefited from this egregious behaviour\u201d. Ms Wolff said in a statement to the BBC that Mr Combs \"looks forward to proving his innocence and vindicating himself in court, where the truth will be established based on evidence, not speculation\". The legal action is the latest against Mr Combs. Mr Combs was arrested last month and is facing criminal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. He is currently in federal custody after he was denied bail, which he is appealing. He has denied all allegations of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to Mr Buzbee, who is licensed to practice law in Texas and New York, the total number of alleged victims he is representing is 120, with half of them being men and the other half women who hail from more than 25 states across the US. He added that 25 of the alleged victims he is representing were minors. This marks the first time that Mr Combs has been accused of sexually abusing children. The allegations span between 1991 to as recently as this year with the incidents taking place in Los Angeles, New York and Miami, Mr Buzbee said. He added most of the incidents occurred after 2015. Most of the plaintiffs, he said, allege they were date raped after parties hosted by Mr Combs that were held at well-known venues, as well as private residences and hotels. Mr Buzbee said the parties were either to mark an album release, or were New Year\u2019s Eve parties and US Independence Day parties. Others occurred at what he said were auditions. \u201cMany times, especially young people wanting to break into the industry, were coerced into this type of conduct in the promise of being made a star or the promise of having Sean Combs listen to their tape,\u201d Mr Buzbee said. One man, who was aged nine at the time, alleges he was sexually abused by Mr Combs and his associates at a recording studio in New York while trying to land a record deal, according to his lawyer. \u201cHad he not been in power, I feel I could\u2019ve been something great. I quit the industry because of what Sean Combs did to me,\u201d he said in a statement via his lawyer. Another man, who was also a minor at the time, alleged he was told by Mr Combs he would be made a \u201cstar\u201d, but he first needed to visit the rapper alone without his parents. Once in a private area, his lawyer claimed Mr Combs then requested the boy perform oral sex on him. Mr Buzbee also raised the case of a then-15-year-old girl who alleges she was flown to New York for a party hosted by Mr Combs and was subsequently raped by him and others. The lawyer claimed there was a clear modus operandi with alleged victims typically being offered \u201claced\u201d drinks before being sexually assaulted. \u201cThe biggest secret in the entertainment industry has finally been revealed to the world,\u201d Mr Buzbee said. \u201cThe wall of silence has now been broken.\u201d He added that this is not a class action lawsuit and that there will be individual cases filed for each alleged victim. Andrew Van Arsdale, an attorney at the AVA law group which is working with Mr Buzbee, said his firm had received more than 3,000 phone calls from people alleging abuse by the music mogul. In addition to the 120 alleged victims, he said his firm were working to vet another 100 cases.\n\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?",

Chapman has also recently begun hosting the BBC's new mid-week Champions League highlights show, secured under a three-year deal with Uefa. Outside television, the broadcaster presents a number of shows on BBC Radio 5 Live, including its football-orientated Monday Night Club.\n\nGabby Logan is one of the UK's most well-known sports presenters, with 20 years' experience hosting major football coverage across various networks. After starting her broadcasting career at Sky, she moved to ITV, deputising for Des Lynam on The Premiership, the channel's highlights show launched after they won the rights from the BBC between 2001 and 2004. Logan later succeeded Lynam to front Champions League coverage on the station, before departing under what she described as a \"cloud\", external when her job as a World Cup anchor was given to a male presenter instead. She swiftly joined the BBC in 2007 and has stood in for Lineker on Match of the Day, alongside covering the biggest sporting events, including the Six Nations, the Olympics, the men's and women's football World Cup and this summer's Euros. Logan has recently begun hosting live games shown on streaming service Amazon Prime, further boosting her Premier League credentials.\n\nScott, another regular Match of the Day stand-in, broke through as one of the first mainstream female football pundits after retiring from the game in 2017. The former England and Arsenal midfielder became the first female analyst to be taken to a men's World Cup by the BBC when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018. Later that summer, she also debuted as Sky Sports' first woman football pundit. In 2021, she took over hosting duties for the BBC's Football Focus - replacing the departing Dan Walker on the weekend preview show. An ever-present broadcaster at men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments since, Scott wore a rainbow armband during England\u2019s first match of the Qatar World Cup - showing support for the LGBT community in a country where homosexuality remains illegal. The recipient of an MBE, she defended her London accent after ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones criticised her pronunciation.\n\nFollowing a stint at TNT Sport, Kate Scott has found her career transformed at the helm of CBS' Champions League coverage. She previously told GQ, external that the show's success relies on its uninhibited feel, calling it the \"locker room environment translated onto television\" - mirroring the personality-driven tone younger audiences are used to from online sports content. One of its pundits, Micah Richards (see below), has separately described Scott as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel. As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot. There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Scott want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?\n\nAlan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United. This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality. Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?\n\nThe ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot. He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter. His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday. Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media. Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone. He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"\n\nBeginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting. The Northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2. But Murray chose to leave that role in 2013, as he had an offer to join TalkSport radio. He has continued to work at the BBC however, presenting various shows on 5 Live, along with becoming host of Channel 4's long-running word show, Countdown. Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.\n\nPrior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus. Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime. But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.\n\nLaura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer. She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year. Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros. Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting. Woods fits the mould of Scott and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.\n\nHumphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits. After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history. Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express, external he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".\n\nAn experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish. The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments. But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme. Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.\n\nCorrection 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio.",

    "NHS will not fund new drug to slow Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nA new drug that slows the pace of Alzheimer's disease is too expensive for too little benefit to be used on the NHS in England, the drugs spending watchdog says. Donanemab was hailed as a turning point in the disease last year. But the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said the drug provided only a small benefit to patients. And it came with huge costs, including the price of the drug and monitoring for significant side-effects such as brain swelling and brain bleeds.\n\nPeople do not get better on donanemab. It is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease, but it slows the progression of the disease. It works by clearing a sticky protein from the brain - called amyloid - which is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's. Donanemab was one of a pair of drugs to generate huge excitement because they were the first to show that Alzheimer's could be slowed down in trials. Earlier today, the drug was approved and given a licence by the safety regulator, the MHRA, which means it can be prescribed privately. But this doesn't mean it can automatically be offered free on the NHS. The NHS does not have a cap on how much it can spend on a drug - it pays for some therapies that cost more than a million pounds. Whether or not a drug is given the green light depends on how big a difference it makes - the more effective and transformative the drug, the more the NHS is willing to pay. The health spending body NICE has ruled the drug would not be a good use of taxpayers' money and was five-to-six times more expensive than the NHS normally considers acceptable. It said donanemab slowed cognitive decline by four to seven months in trials. This could keep people living independently at home for longer. \u201cThis is just not enough benefit to justify the additional cost to the NHS,\" said Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. \u201cI know this will be disappointing news, but this is an emerging field of medicine and there are other treatments being developed.\u201d It is not known exactly how much the drug would cost the NHS. In the US it has an official price of around \u00a325,000 a year per patient. However, that is just the cost of the drug. Surrounding care - including an infusion every four weeks and checking for side-effects - significantly adds to the bill. It is estimated that around 70,000 adults in England would have been eligible for treatment with donanemab. Wales and Northern Ireland normally adopt NICE decisions on drugs while a separate body makes recommendations in Scotland. The decision to reject the drug was made despite potential savings to the NHS and social care being considered.\n\u2022 None Will the NHS ever pay for the new era of dementia drugs?\n\nThe drug is not free of risk. Brain swelling was a common side-effect in up to a third of patients in the donanemab trial. For most, this resolved without causing symptoms. However, two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain. It means people need genetic testing before they are allowed to go on the drug and regular monitoring while being given donanemab. NICE also said the drug could only be used for 18 months and the impact beyond that was uncertain. Another drug to slow Alzheimer's - lecanemab - was found to be too costly for the NHS in the summer. Prof Fiona Carragher, from the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said these drugs offered a \"new horizon of hope in the fight against dementia\". She described the decision as \"disheartening\" but said the organisation respected the decision not to fund it on the NHS. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the president of the British Neuroscience Association, said: \u201cWhile people living with dementia and their loved ones will undoubtedly be disappointed by the decision not to fund this new treatment on the NHS, the good news that new treatments can slow disease even a small amount is hopeful.\" Hilary Evans-Newton, from Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \"Today\u2019s announcement marks another frustrating setback for people affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \"Dementia remains the UK\u2019s leading cause of death, and without action, an ageing population means more families will be affected, driving up NHS costs through emergency admissions and care.\"",
    "Why the US is sending Israel a powerful Thaad anti-missile system\n\nEach Thaad system - like this one seen in an archive photo - costs about $1bn (\u00a3766m)\n\nThe Pentagon has confirmed it is sending a high-altitude anti-missile system operated by US troops to Israel. Officials say the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) battery will bolster Israeli air defences after Iran\u2019s missile attack on the country earlier this month. President Joe Biden has said it is meant \"to defend Israel\", which is still expected to retaliate against an Iranian strike involving more than 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel on 1 October. The move has become the focus of attention as it involves putting American boots on the ground in Israel. There are already a small number of US forces in the country - but this new deployment of about 100 troops is significant as it signals further US entanglement in the expanding regional war. It is also being scoured for clues as to what it means about the effectiveness of Israel\u2019s missile defences as the crisis grows. Israel has yet to launch its retaliation for Iran\u2019s attack, which will be \"lethal, precise and above all, surprising\" according to Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Tehran said it fired on Israel because it assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, in Beirut.\n\nThe Pentagon said an advance team and components needed for the battery arrived in Israel on Monday \u2013 with further personnel and parts to follow in the coming days. The battery will be operational in the \u201cnear future\u201d, a statement said. Israeli journalist Avi Scharf, who routinely monitors flight tracking data, said two C-17 US military transporters flew from Alabama to the Israeli Air Force's Nevatim base overnight, likely carrying Thaad equipment. It\u2019s still unclear whether the Thaad deployment is part of US contingency planning to bridge gaps identified in Israel\u2019s aerial defences, or whether it points to growing concerns in Washington of a more forceful Israeli strike on Iran. President Biden has opposed any attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, as well as on its oil or energy infrastructure, amid fears that it would trigger a spiralling conflict and affect the global economy. Whatever the background to the decision, it signals a further need by Israel for US defence assistance amid the expanding Middle East war.\n\nRockets seen above Tel Aviv after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles on 1 October\n\nBallistic missiles like the Fattah-1used by Iran earlier this month are fired upwards into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where they change trajectory and descend towards their target. One of their military advantages is their immense speed compared with cruise missiles or drones. The Thaad system is highly effective against ballistic missiles, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the biggest US arms maker. The system counts six truck-mounted launchers, with eight interceptors on each launcher. It costs about $1bn (\u00a3766m) a battery and requires a crew of about 100 to operate it. Thaad is much sought after including by Ukraine to counter Russian missile attacks. Saudi Arabia has orders in for it, and reportedly wanted more as part of an American weapons bonanza in return for officially recognising Israel: a so-called \"normalisation\" deal which was largely derailed after the 7 October attack by Hamas.\n\nIran\u2019s 1 October strikes on Israel killed one man in Jericho in the occupied West Bank, who was hit by part of a missile that was apparently shot down. Israel has a much vaunted aerial defence system, developed with the US, including Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 exo-atmospheric missiles. These fly at hypersonic speed and can shoot down ballistic missiles in space. The system\u2019s Israeli designers said Arrow \"performed as expected\" with \"wonderful\" results against the Iranian strike. The US supported the defensive operation, firing interceptors from two naval destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, alongside support from some European and Arab countries. Washington presented the Iranian strike as \"defeated and ineffective\". But damage on the ground told a less emphatic picture. Satellite images showed damage at the Nevatim base, which houses F-35 fighter planes, including craters on a runway and taxiway. Decker Eveleth from the Washington-based Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) said the images showed 32 impact points, including multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers. \"Some F-35s got really lucky,\" Mr Eveleth posted on X. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that it was still unclear whether damage was caused directly by missiles or interception shrapnel. There were other direct impacts, including in Tel Aviv. One missile reportedly blew a 30ft (nine metre) deep crater in a densely populated area close to the headquarters of Mossad, Israel\u2019s spy agency.\n\nPolitically, the Thaad announcement is couched in terms of the Biden administration\u2019s \"ironclad\" support for Israel\u2019s defence. The US has sent more than 50,000 tonnes worth of weapons to Israel in the last year, according to Israeli figures. But it also highlights some of the policy contortions carried out by Washington: first trying to pressure Israel and its adversaries not to escalate the war, instead urging diplomacy. When that has failed the White House has then firmly backed its Israeli ally\u2019s decisions while moving to shield it diplomatically and militarily. The Iranian missile strikes followed Israel\u2019s assassinations of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh (a negotiator in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks), Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Israeli air strikes in densely populated parts of Beirut and its ground invasion of Lebanon. Israel said it has been striking against Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and destroying its vast missile stores due to 11 months of cross-border rocket fire into Israel. It argues only military pressure and degrading Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities will ensure 60,000 Israelis can return to their homes in northern Israel. The Pentagon describes the Thaad deployment as part of \"the broader adjustments the US military has made in recent months\" to support Israel and defend American personnel from attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed groups. It says a Thaad was deployed in southern Israel for an exercise in 2019, the last and only time it was known to be there. A US military deployment to Israel outside of drills is extremely rare, given Israel's own capabilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned on Sunday that the US was putting the lives of its troops \"at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel\".",
    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nThe father of Sara Sharif has told a jury he was the \"worst parent on the planet\". Urfan Sharif described his parenting as \"very bad\" and accepted he was unkind and cruel under cross-examination at the Old Bailey. The court previously heard that Sara was hooded, burned and beaten during more than two years of abuse before she was found dead at her family home in Woking, Surrey, last year. Mr Sharif, 42, Sara's stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder and causing or allowing the death of a child.\n\nA post-mortem examination found Sara had suffered dozens of injuries including \"probable human bite marks\", an iron burn and scalding from hot water before she died on 8 August 2023. Mr Sharif agreed that violence to Sara had become \"normalised\" at times in the house, but he said his brother, Mr Malik - who lived with the family - was unaware of Sara being beaten at home. The prosecution challenged Mr Sharif about how others in the small three-bedroom home were unaware of violence to Sara. \"Everything was separate from Faisal Malik,\" Mr Sharif said. Under cross examination, he was questioned about a burn to Sara\u2019s buttocks and bite marks, which he denies causing. \"To do that to Sara, to press and hold the iron across both her buttocks, two people had to do that?\" prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC asked Mr Sharif. \"I don\u2019t know how it happened,\" Mr Sharif told jurors.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nMr Emlyn Jones KC asked if someone would have had to hold Sara down and restrain her. \"I don\u2019t know sir, must have been the kids,\" Mr Sharif told the court. Mr Emlyn Jones KC asked: \"How low will you stoop?\"\n\nThe court previously heard a bloodstained cricket bat, a rolling pin with Sara\u2019s DNA on it, a metal pole, a belt and rope were found near the family\u2019s outhouse. Mr Sharif was pressed by Mr Emlyn Jones KC: \"When you beat Sara so hard with a cricket bat that you broke her spine, did you intend to cause her a really serious injury?\" Jurors were previously told Mr Sharif\u2019s case was that Ms Batool was responsible for Sara\u2019s death, and he made a false confession in a phone call and also in a note to protect his wife. On Wednesday he changed his evidence, saying: \"She died because of me.\" He later denied intending to kill her.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "The fire caused the first and second storeys of the old building to collapse\n\nA children's charity says it is devastated after losing \u201cabsolutely everything\u201d in a large fire. The Magic Cottage, which supports children with additional needs and life-limiting illnesses, was the epicentre of the blaze which broke out in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, on Sunday night. More than 100 firefighters were called to the scene on Frogmore Street and about 12 residents had to leave their homes. Lesley Reynolds, who was inspired to set up the charity after adopting an autistic child, thanked crews for \u201cvaliantly battling the inferno with an incredible emergency plan in place\u201d.\n\nMore than 100 firefighters tackled the flames, but could not save the shop\n\nBut despite the team endeavour, she added, the \u201cold, iconic building could not be saved\u201d. The row of shops affected by the fire was in the town centre, and residents said the loss would be felt greatly by the community.

Lesley said the team\u2019s thoughts were with all those affected, including the building\u2019s owner Alan Griffiths, and thanked the community and her staff for their unwavering support. \u201cThe next few months will be a time of uncertainty for us as a charity, however we will do our very best to keep offering the help and support that we give to our Magic families, schools and hospitals,\u201d she said.\n\nLesley Reynolds is the director of the Magic Cottage, which was destroyed in the fire\n\nLesley said she set up the charity after adopting her daughter Gabby from Croatia, who is partially sighted and autistic, with the family struggling to access support. \u201cShe is extremely upset but trying to stay positive,\u201d Lesley told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast of Gabby's reaction to the fire. \u201cWe are finding a new place in Abergavenny and would appeal to any landlords with decent-size shops available to rent.\" She said \"things are moving towards a good direction\" as authorities work to determine the cause of the blaze.\n\nLesley set up the charity inspired by her daughter\n\nFirefighters used four water bowsers, two aerial ladder platforms, and a high volume pump to tackle the flames. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the fire caused the first and second floors and roof of the building to collapse and a \"thorough investigation\" alongside Gwent Police crime scene investigators would be carried out to establish how the outbreak began. Police added the large cordon encompassing several nearby streets remained in place after the blaze was extinguished due to ongoing safety concerns, but this would be continually reviewed and adapted by experts.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

    "The current funding model for Northern Ireland Water is fit for purpose, according to the infrastructure minister. Housebuilding in Northern Ireland fell to a 60-year low last year, partially due to restrictions on new connections to an underfunded water system. Plans for an estimated 19,000 homes are being held up due to the restrictions - affecting construction in 23 towns. In March, a report from the NI Audit Office (NIAO) said there should be a comprehensive expert review of how NI Water was funded and governed.\n\nWhen asked by BBC's The View if the current funding model, and the way in which NI Water is established is \"fit for purpose\", John O'Dowd replied: \"Yes.\" \u201cIn fairness, the audit report does not suggest it is not fit for purpose\u2026 what it suggests is that we look at alternative models,\u201d O\u2019Dowd said. \u201cAll alternative models that have been brought to my attention thus far involve domestic water charges, I am not introducing [them].\u201d\n\nO'Dowd reiterated that he is unwilling to introduce domestic water charges\n\nO'Dowd told the programme that he doesn't \"recognise\" figures from industry bodies, who have described the housing backlog as a \"fiasco\". The Construction Employers Federation has criticised the Department for Infrastructure and NI Water over thousands of homes which cannot be connected to the waste water system. It told a hearing of Stormont's infrastructure committee that 8,500 homes are being held back, which it said is around \u00a31bn in investment. The Royal Society of Ulster Architects (RSUA) told the same committee that one architectural practice had \u00a3400m of projects held up in the system. The organisation said that the situation with waste water in Northern Ireland was a \"fiasco\".\n\n\"It all depends on how you add them [the housing figures] up, or what formula you use,\" O'Dowd said. The minister highlighted the budgetary pressures of his department, which he explained faces \"significant challenges\". He added: \"4,500 homes could have been connected during this price period, and there is the potential for 18,500 to be connected if developer contributions are included\". O'Dowd would not be drawn on questions of specific new build developments which are yet to be connected to the waste water system, and said: \"You've clearly done a lot of research which you could have shared with me beforehand, you chose not to.\" \"You need to look at the planning conditions that were on those developments before they commenced,\" he added.\n\nNI Water has indicated that its waste water infrastructure is operating at full capacity. In August, it said construction had been stalled in 23 towns. The provider blamed underfunding, and a backlog in necessary upgrades and expansions is delaying new housing developments being connected to the existing network. Last week, representatives from the utility provider warned Stormont that capacity problems would get worse without additional long-term funding. The infrastructure committee was told NI Water is facing a significant gap in funding - both in the day-to-day running of operations and on the longer term capital side. NI Water director of finance Ronan Larkin said there was a \u00a323m funding gap between what they needed to run the service and what was available. On the long-term capital spending plan, he said there was a \u00a3266m gap in funding or a shortfall of about 45%. On Thursday, O'Dowd pointed to an additional \u00a331m in funding which came from the Stormont monitoring round earlier this month. He told the programme that, for this financial year, there remains an estimated \u00a3100m deficit that he is unable to fill. \u201cI want to ensure NI Water is delivering an efficient, effective service,\u201d the minister added.",
    "Almost \u00a31bn in funding will go to delivering London-style buses across England as part of a massive Budget boost, the government has promised. The Department for Transport (DfT) has given more details on its plans for 2025 after announcing the funding last month. It has promised to deliver what it calls \"London-style\" services to every corner of the country, and said funding would be allocated based on levels of deprivation and population, instead of making areas compete for investment as it has in previous years. The DfT says Leicester, the Isle of Wight, Torbay, Southend, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are set to receive \"unprecedented\" levels of funding.\n\nIn urban areas, some of the biggest allocations are being given to combined authorities representing South Yorkshire and the Liverpool City Region. In total, there will be \u00a3712m for local authorities to improve services, alongside a further \u00a3243m for bus operators. About 3.4 million people in England travel regularly by bus, making it the most commonly used mode of public transport. Local authorities in all English regions will be able to introduce new bus routes, make services more frequent and protect crucial routes, the DfT says. It added the money will allow more urban areas to maintain high levels of service. Meanwhile, rural communities and small towns will be able to offer more services. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the funding would \"vastly improve\" the reliability and frequency of services, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of the Buses Bill, which aims to give local transport authorities across England new powers to take control of bus services. Under the plans, local authorities would be allowed to introduce a London-style franchising system, meaning they can decide routes, timetables and fares, with operators bidding to run the services for a fixed fee. The government has also pledged to remove a ban on publicly owned bus companies. An extra \u00a3151m will also fund a cap in single bus fares outside London, which rose to \u00a33 last month, until the end of 2025. The Liberal Democrats have called for the government to U-turn on the decision to raise the cap, with the party saying it will hit both commuters and local businesses. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said on Friday: \"The fare cap increase is like a bus tax for people across the country, impacting bus users and commuters already struggling to make ends meet. \"MPs must be given a say on this bus fare hike on behalf of their constituents.\" Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Labour have chosen to increase bus fares by 50% in a further attack on rural communities, working people and pensioners. \"They didn\u2019t have the courage to tell people their plans in the election. This is another broken promise that raises costs on working people.\" But the DfT said the fare cap introduced by the previous Conservative government was due to expire at the end of 2024 and some fares would have soared unless it intervened. \u201cFares will only be allowed to increase with inflation in the normal way, and the \u00a33 bus fare cap will lead to savings of up to 80% on some routes, keeping bus tickets affordable across the country,\" it said.\n\u2022 None More bus services could come under control of councils",
    "Families reunite with bodies of missing British soldiers 70 years on\n\nMichael Northey's father was one of four soldiers killed in the Korean War to have been successfully identified\n\nFrom his wheelchair, Michael Northey watches quietly over his father\u2019s grave, and lays a flower for the very first time. \u201cThis is the closest I\u2019ve been to him in 70 years, which is ridiculous,\u201d he jokes poignantly. Born into a poor family in the backstreets of Portsmouth, Michael was still a baby when his father, the youngest of 13 children, left to fight in the Korean War. He was killed in action, his body never identified. For decades, it lay in an unmarked grave in the UN cemetery in Busan, on Korea\u2019s south coast, adorned with the plaque \u2018Member of the British Army, known unto God\u2019. Now it bears his name \u2013 Sergeant D. Northey, died 24 April 1951, age 23. Sergeant Northey, along with three others, are the first unknown British soldiers killed in the Korean War to be successfully identified, and Michael is attending a ceremony, along with the other families, to rename their graves.\n\nSergeant D. Northey, Corporal William Adair, and Major Patrick Angier were killed fighting in the Korean War\n\nMichael had spent years doing his own research, hoping to find out where his father was buried, but had eventually given up. \u201cI\u2019m ill and don\u2019t have a lot of time left myself, so I\u2019d written it off. I thought I\u2019d never find out,\u201d he says. But a couple of months ago, Michael received a phone call. Unknown to him, researchers at the Ministry of Defence had been conducting their own investigation. When he heard the news, he \u201cwailed like a banshee for 20 minutes\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t describe the emotional release,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cThis had haunted me for 70 years. The poor lady who phoned me, I felt sorry for her!\u201d\n\nMichael was a baby when his father left to fight in the Korean War\n\nThe woman on the other end of the phone was Nicola Nash, a forensic researcher from the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre in Gloucester, who ordinarily works to identify victims from the First and Second World Wars. Tasked for the first time with finding the Korean War dead, she had to start from scratch - by first compiling a list of the 300 British soldiers still missing, of whom 76 were buried in the cemetery in Busan. Nicola went through their burial reports, and found just one man had been buried wearing sergeant stripes from the Gloucester Regiment, as well as one major. After trawling the national archives and cross referencing eyewitness accounts, family letters and war office reports, Ms Nash was able to identify these men as Sergeant Northey and Major Patrick Angier.\n\nThe men had been in unmarked graves but the graves in Busan have since been renamed\n\nBoth were killed in the famous Battle of Imjin River, in April 1951, as the Chinese Army - which had joined the war on the North Korean side - tried to push the allied forces down the peninsula to retake the capital Seoul. Despite being hugely outnumbered, the men held their position for three days, giving their comrades enough time to retreat and successfully defend the city. The issue at the time, Ms Nash explains, is that because the battle was so bloody, most of the men were either killed or captured, leaving no one to identify them. The enemy had removed and scattered their dog tags. It was not until the prisoners of war were released that they were able share their accounts of the battle. No one had thought to go back and piece the puzzles together \u2013 until now. For Ms Nash, this has been a six-year \u201clabour of love\u201d, made slightly easier, she admits, by having some of the men\u2019s children still alive to draw on, something that has also made the process more special. \u201cThe children have spent their whole lives not knowing what happened to their fathers, and for me to be able to do this work and bring them here to their graves, to say their goodbyes and have that closure, means everything,\" she says.\n\nMajor Angier\u2019s daughter, Tabby, had visited the war graves cemetery in Busan previously, without knowing her father was actually buried there\n\nAt the ceremony, the families sit on chairs amidst the long rows of small stone graves which mark the thousands of foreign soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War. They are accompanied by serving soldiers from their loved ones\u2019 former regiments. Major Angier\u2019s daughter, Tabby, now 77, and his grandson Guy, stand to read excerpts of letters he wrote from the front line. In one of his final letters, he writes to his wife: \u201cLots of love to our dear children. Do tell them how much Daddy misses them and will come back as soon as he has finished his work.\" Tabby was three years old when her father left for the war, and her memories of him are fractured: \u201cI can remember someone standing in a room and canvas bags piling up, which must have been his equipment to go to Korea. But I can\u2019t see his face,\u201d she says. At the time of her father\u2019s death, people didn\u2019t like to talk about wars, Tabby says. Instead, people in her small Gloucestershire village used to remark: \u201cOh, those poor children, they\u2019ve lost their father.\" \u201cI used to think that if he\u2019s lost, they\u2019re going to find him,\u201d says Tabby. But as the years passed, and she learnt what had happened, Tabby was told her father\u2019s body would never be found. The last record of his whereabouts suggested his body had been left under an upturned boat on the battlefield. Tabby had twice previously visited the cemetery in Busan, in an attempt to get as close to her father as she thought possible - not knowing his actual grave was here all along. \u201cI think it will take some time to sink in,\u201d she says, from his newly-adorned graveside.\n\nCameron Adair's great, great uncle, Corporal William Adair, was one of four soldiers to be identified in the proces\n\nThe shock has been even greater for 25-year-old Cameron Adair, from Scunthorpe, whose great, great uncle, Corporal William Adair, is one of two soldiers from the Royal Ulster Rifles identified by Ms Nash. The other is Rifleman Mark Foster, from County Durham. Both men were killed in January 1951 as they were forced to retreat by a platoon of Chinese soldiers. Corporal Adair did not have children, and when his wife died so did his memory, leaving Cameron and his family unaware of his existence. Finding out his relative \u201chelped bring freedom to so many people\u201d has brought Cameron \u201ca real sense of pride,\u201d he says. \u201cComing here and witnessing this firsthand has really brought it home\u201d. Now a similar age to his uncle when he was killed, Cameron feels inspired and says he would like to serve should the need arise. Ms Nash is now gathering DNA samples from the relatives of the other 300 missing soldiers, in the hope she can give more families the same peace and joy she has brought to Cameron, Tabby and Michael. \u201cIf there are still British personnel missing, we will keep trying to find them,\u201d she says.",

There are also recalls for prop D'Arcy Rae, centre Rory Hutchinson and winger Darcy Graham, who has been missing through injury since the 2023 World Cup. Glasgow's New Zealand-born fly-half Tom Jordan has recently become eligible and his inclusion nudges Ben Healy out of the 45-man squad. Alex Samuel, Ben Muncaster and Freddy Douglas - who has yet to feature in the United Rugby Championship for Edinburgh - are the other uncapped players chosen by head coach Gregor Townsend. Finn Russell and Rory Darge were co-captains for the Six Nations and are listed as vice-captains for the November matches. Experienced locks Jonny and Richie Gray are not selected, with hooker Johnny Matthews plus back-row forwards Hamish Watson and Magnus Bradbury also overlooked. Sam Skinner, Andy Christie, Cameron Redpath and Kyle Steyn are among those missing through injury. Players based in England and France will not be available for the opening match against Fiji on 2 November as it falls outside the international window. World champions South Africa visit Murrayfield eight days later, with the Portugal game on 16 November and the match against Australia on 24 November.\n\nAustralia-born Sione Tuipulotu - who qualifies for Scotland through his grandmother from Greenock - has earned 27 caps since joining Glasgow Warriors in 2021.

    "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has ordered officials to look at the costs for the NHS of implementing any changes in the law on assisted dying. Streeting, who plans to vote against a new assisted dying bill when it is debated later this month, has suggested what is proposed could lead to cuts in other NHS services. The bill, published on Monday, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their life if two doctors and a High Court judge verify they are eligible and have made their decision voluntarily. The policy would have \"resource implications\" which would \"come at the expense of other choices\", Streeting told Times Radio.\n\nSpeaking to the NHS Providers conference in Liverpool, Streeting said: \"I've asked my department to look at the costs that would be associated with providing a new service to enable assisted dying to go forward.\" The department said it had not begun a formal review, but assessing the impact of potential new legislation was \u201cregular policy work\u201d. Streeting also said he was worried about a \"chilling slippery slope argument\" if people felt compelled to end their own lives as a cost-saving measure. But he added: \"Regardless of my own personal position or my own vote, my department and the whole government will respect the will of Parliament if people vote for assisted dying.\"\n\nStreeting had earlier warned that financing assisted dying would come at the expense of other NHS services. Asked by Times Radio whether he would have to find money from elsewhere if the bill became law, Streeting said: \"Yep, to govern is to choose. \"If Parliament chooses to go ahead with assisted dying, it is making a choice that this is an area to prioritise for investment. And we'd have to work through those implications.\" He said the health service would \"need to work through with the medical profession what would be a very new way of working\". \"No one should be compelled, for example, to take part in assisted dying if they have got moral or ethical objections as clinicians. That certainly would be one of my red lines\". Streeting has repeatedly expressed his view that the palliative care system is not \"where it needs to be to give people a real choice\". Downing Street declined to confirm if he was right about assisted dying costs impacting NHS services. The prime minister's spokesperson said it was \"a matter for Parliament to decide\" after debating \"the issues surrounding the Bill\".\n\nThe assisted dying bill has been introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who argues her legislation is the \"most robust\" in the world. She has said she expects hundreds of dying people to apply if it is available. Critics of her measure have raised fears of coercion and a slippery slope to wider legislation taking in more people. Speaking on Tuesday, Leadbeater rejected these claims, saying her bill had \u201cthree layers of scrutiny,\u201d requiring sign-offs from two doctors and a High Court judge, and made coercion punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Only terminally-ill adults with less than six months to live who have a settled wish to end their lives would be eligible under the new law. MPs are scheduled to debate and vote on the bill on 29 November. The prime minister, a former director of public prosecutions, has previously supported assisted dying, but the government has pledged to remain neutral on the issue, and MPs are being allowed to vote according to their conscience rather than along party lines. This will be the first Commons vote on assisted dying since MPs rejected allowing terminally ill adults to end their lives under medical supervision in 2015. As a backbench Labour MP, Streeting voted in favour of that measure. If the bill passes its first vote later this month, it will receive further scrutiny from MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it.",
    "There are three rounds of the 2024 Formula 1 season remaining, with Max Verstappen on the verge of clinching a fourth successive drivers' championship. Dutchman Verstappen leads Lando Norris by 62 points and the Briton needs to win at least three more points than him in Las Vegas next week to keep the title race alive. Before F1 heads back to the United States, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions on the key talking points in the sport.\n\nHow big is the threat of Ferrari to McLaren in the constructors' championship? - Daphne McLaren are 36 points ahead of Ferrari heading into the final three races of the season, which start with Las Vegas on 21-23 November, followed by Qatar and Abu Dhabi on the next two weekends. That's a decent lead, enough that if McLaren perform well in Las Vegas and Qatar, they could seal the title before the final race of the season. But because both cars score in the constructors' championship, it is definitely winnable for Ferrari. There are a total of 44 points available on a normal weekend, as Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi are, and 59 on the Qatar sprint weekend - so 147 on the table in total. On paper, Las Vegas favours Ferrari - it is the sort of track on which they have been strong this year. A street circuit, with predominantly slow corners, with some big braking down from high speed. This emphasises Ferrari's strengths and does not play to McLaren's. Think of Ferrari's pace in Monaco, Monza, Baku, Singapore and Mexico. Qatar, though, is expected to favour McLaren - and Ferrari are a little worried about their prospective pace there. But the top three teams are all closely matched, so it's hard to predict how things will go. Think of Singapore, for example, where Charles Leclerc really should have qualified on the front row for Ferrari, but made a mistake on his qualifying lap. Or Baku, where again Leclerc-Ferrari was probably the fastest driver-car combination but McLaren executed a good strategy to bring Oscar Piastri into range, and the Australian got ahead with a brilliant late overtaking dive, holding on to win under intense pressure. And what will be Red Bull's pace in the dry after a strong showing in the US, but a disappointing weekend in Mexico? In short, McLaren have a lead large enough to make them favourites, but it's a lot more open than the drivers' championship, where Max Verstappen can clinch the title in Las Vegas if he beats Lando Norris, and in some finishing combinations even if he does not.\n\nWhy is F1 talking about rotating some races? Why not add more dates to the calendar first? Other series prove it is possible - Tim The short answer to this is that the calendar is at - or close to - capacity, and a number of countries are pushing for entry. The teams' contracts with F1 dictate a maximum of 25 races, but F1 chairman Stefano Domenicali recently described 24 as \"the balanced number that we feel is right\". This reflects the fact that most people in F1 feel the calendar is already long enough - many, in fact, believe it is too long. Yes, the US-based Nascar stock-car racing series has 41 race weekends in 2025, but all but one of them are in one country, even if it is a very large one. And it's traditional for Nascar to have a long season. In F1, it's still a relatively recent development. F1 wants a race in Africa and is in talks with Rwanda, Saudi Arabia could get a second race at the new facility in Qiddiya when it is finished in a few years' time and Franco Colapinto's emergence has led to talk of a return for Argentina, which last held a grand prix in 1998. South Korea and Thailand have also been mentioned. So something has to give - and that's where the idea of rotation comes in. On top of that, hosting a grand prix is expensive and some European races are struggling to make ends meet. The races talked about in this context are Belgium, the Netherlands and Barcelona. But nothing is decided and it depends on myriad factors. Do Belgium and/or the Netherlands want to rotate? Does Barcelona, which is losing the Spanish Grand Prix to Madrid in 2026, want to continue, and what's the appetite for two races in Spain? And so on.\n\nWhy do the drivers have use of DRS during qualifying? - Simon The principle behind being able to use the DRS overtaking aid in qualifying is that the whole point of qualifying is to go as fast as possible. A lap is faster with the use of DRS than without, so it is allowed. On this basis, the question would really be, why would DRS not be allowed in qualifying? When the DRS overtaking aid was first introduced in 2011, use was free in qualifying. But after two years, it was decided on safety grounds to limit its use to the DRS zones permitted in the race. The advantage gained from using the DRS varies from car to car. One of the factors in Red Bull's domination of 2022 and 2023 was that they had a far larger 'DRS offset' than most other cars, giving them a bigger advantage in qualifying and also when fighting for position in the race. Other teams have since been working to overturn this deficit, and some - including McLaren - are only just getting there. This issue will disappear in 2026, when new rules will bring the end of DRS. In its place, moveable front and rear wings will be used to help optimise the cars with the new engines, which have a far higher proportion of their overall power output provided by the hybrid element. Moveable aerodynamics - reducing drag on the straight but returning downforce for the corners - were needed to increase straight-line speed, to allow the cars to recover sufficient energy during braking. DRS will be replaced by a push-to-pass button, which temporarily gives an extra boost of electrical energy.\n\nThe first night race was held in Singapore in 2008\n\nWhy don't they run night races in European countries? It would be cool having somewhere like Monaco at night, especially as it's so boring - Arun When the first night race was held in Singapore in 2008, it was all about viewing figures in F1's core market - Europe. Singapore is seven hours ahead of the UK, so moving the start time to 20:00 local time meant it started at 13:00 in Britain and 14:00 in Europe - exactly when, at the time, a European grand prix would start. Rather than having it start early in the morning, which is always an issue with Japan, for example, or Australia. Obviously, the same demand is not there for a European race. But there are other factors, too. Moving start times later in Europe would help for US viewers, but it is not a conventional time for a European audience - which is considered quite traditional in its viewing habits. European races are not as well funded as those in places such as the Middle East and Singapore, and holding a night race is expensive in terms of infrastructure, with lighting and so on. And there are local factors to consider, such as whether people would attend that late, the logistics of entry and exit after dark, the after-hours cost of police and so on. And, apart from anything else, the demand has not been there from European organisers, whereas places such as Abu Dhabi and Bahrain actively wanted one in the wake of Singapore's success. A couple of European organisers have asked for a night race - most recently Madrid. But the sport's biggest broadcasters are not keen, and it would also put F1 up against popular TV shows in the evening in Europe, such as Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nLando Norris (right) has won three races this season, while team-mate Oscar Piastri has won twice\n\nDoes the paddock believe Oscar Piastri could be McLaren's lead title contender next season? Seems very fast, and calmer than Lando Norris under pressure - Matt The first thing to say is that there is uniformity of opinion across F1 about very few questions of this sort. Which driver is better than another is to some degree a subjective question, as any fan can tell you, even if the opinion of a significant majority of people in F1 at the moment seems to be that Max Verstappen is the best. When it comes to assessing team-mates, however, the question can at least be addressed with more facts. Piastri has had a good season, there is no doubt about that. He has followed up his maiden victory in Hungary with a second in Azerbaijan, taken with a daring and opportunistic overtaking move on Charles Leclerc. He has also shown some robust and clinical racing skills - not just with that win in Baku, but with his first-lap pass of Norris around the outside of the second chicane in Monza, for example. He's also in only his second season, whereas Norris is in his sixth. Be that as it may, Norris has been conclusively faster. Until Piastri took sprint pole at the last race in Brazil, he had not out-qualified Norris on merit since Monaco. And Norris has a 0.15 second average advantage over his team-mate over one lap this season. Together, they make one of the strongest driver line-ups on the grid, and how the internal battle at McLaren plays out in the next couple of years is one of the most interesting questions in the sport. But at the moment, based on their careers so far, Norris has had the edge.",

South Wales, where a major incident has been declared by one council, has seen over 100mm of rain in places, while two areas in the south east of the country are under severe flood warnings, detailing a \"significant risk to life\". Ms Morgan said authorities had been prepared for the storm, but added that \"when you get the kind of enormity of rain we\u2019ve had over the past few days\", minimising the impact was always \"going to be difficult\". The worst of the rain is moving eastwards into England, where the midlands and south west have also seen flooding. Across the UK, more than 100 flood warnings, external are now in force.\n\nYellow warnings for wind and rain have been in effect for western Scotland, southern England and Wales, as well as Northern Ireland but are due to expire late on Sunday. A sole yellow warning for wind comes into force on Monday covering part of Scotland. There are also hundreds of flood alerts in place in England, Wales and Scotland. Wind gusts have reached 75mph in coastal areas and up to 65mph inland. North Wales Police said on Sunday afternoon that a body had been found by officers searching for a man who went missing at the River Conwy near Trefriw in Conwy county during the storm on Saturday. Formal identification has not yet taken place but the family of Brian Perry, 75, have been informed, police said. Around London, all of the Royal Parks closed on Sunday due to high winds - including Hyde Park and its popular Winter Wonderland attraction. The parks' management said there would be delayed re-openings on Monday following a safety inspection.\n\nThis was the scene in east London on Sunday where strong winds almost toppled this scaffolding onto Bethnal Green Road\n\nTravel disruption to roads and railway lines due to floodwater, high winds and fallen trees continued in some areas on Sunday after similar incidents on Saturday. One train from Sheffield to London was more than five hours delayed, with the service taking a detour and encountering further flooding along the alternative route. A backlog meant the train was stationary for two hours, with staff giving out free water and snacks. There were many families with tired young kids crying, and people getting frustrated with the lack of information. Pictures from Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire showed streets submerged in water as the town's Kyre Brook rose and caused a wall to collapse. In south Wales, a major incident has been declared by Rhondda Cynon Taf Council after significant flooding. The River Taff has burst its banks in Pontypridd, and residents in the town were seen using buckets to remove water from outside their homes. Wales' first minister said there had been \"huge investment\" since the Storm Dennis, but acknowledged that many people had been affected for a second time. Asked about claims of a lack of warnings from authorities ahead of the storm, she added: \u201cWe certainly knew Storm Bert was coming, so there was an amount of preparation. \"But when you get the kind of enormity of rain we\u2019ve had over the past few days \u2013 and it\u2019s still coming down \u2013 then we\u2019ve got to recognise that it is going to be difficult.\" She added that discussions had begun about what support would be provided to those affected. Climate change was \u201cclearly making a difference in the severity and the frequency of these weather events\", she said. \"There will come a point when it will be too difficult to protect every home in the country, but clearly we want to put the support in place if we\u2019re able to do that,\u201d she said. Three rest centres have been set up for affected residents. Between 200 and 300 properties - residential and commercial - have been affected by flooding, the council added. Record river levels were recorded on the River Taff on Saturday night but officials said these levels were beginning to drop as rain subsides, although residents were still urged to be cautious. The Abercynon Feeder Pipe Footbridge over the river was completely washed away, council leader Andrew Morgan told a news conference on Sunday afternoon. The bridge was being rebuilt after being badly damaged during Storm Dennis in 2020, which also caused significant flooding to homes and businesses when it hit the area. Mr Morgan told reporters he was \"amazed\" that only a yellow weather warning was issued for the area and said \"we were preparing for the possibility of an amber warning\". Further east, National Resources Wales (NRW) issued two severe flood warnings on Sunday covering parts of the River Monnow in Monmouthshire. The warnings are the most serious that can be issued and indicate that \"significant risk to life\" and disruption is expected from severe flooding.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPontypridd resident Paula Williams said flooding had hit \"in exactly the same place\" as it had done previously, criticising NRW's efforts to adequately protect the area. \"They've tried to convince everybody that the flood defences worked. I have got videos proving the flood defences don't work,\" she added. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Sunday he had spoken with Ms Morgan and would continue to receive updates about Storm Bert as it moved across the UK. \"Thank you to the emergency services who are working tirelessly to protect communities \u2014 my thoughts are with those impacted,\" he said on X.\n\nSince Storm Bert made landfall on Friday, at least five men have died - including the man reported to be Brian Perry - on the roads. A man in his 60s died on Saturday after a tree hit his car near Winchester, and two others died in crashes - one in West Yorkshire and another in Northamptonshire - though the latter incidents have not been directly attributed to the storm. In Lancashire, a man in his 80s died after his car entered a ford on Saturday - police have not directly related his death to the storm. Parts of Scotland experienced a second day of disruption with high winds and localised flooding after Storm Bert swept heavy snow and rain across the country. Milder temperatures caused the snow which covered the north of England and much of Scotland earlier this week to melt. Amber weather warnings for snow were in place on Saturday for parts of Scotland and north-east England, while large swathes of the UK were under yellow weather warnings. Following hours of heavy rain caused by Storm Bert, residents in Dundonald in Northern Ireland were stranded in their homes due to the floodwater on Saturday.\n\nThe River Taff has burst its bank in Pontypridd, flooding homes and a nearby street\n\nHow is Storm Bert affecting you?",
    "'My mother hid letters sent by my WW2 sweetheart'\n\nPhyllis Vincent said parents exerted more authority in her youth, compared with today\n\nA 102-year-old woman who served as a land girl during World War Two has recalled the betrayal she felt when letters from her sweetheart were kept from her by a disapproving mother. Phyllis Vincent, who now lives in a care home in Cambridge, was called up to the Land Army as an 18-year-old in 1940 and worked on a farm in her native Devon. She had already begun a budding romance with Ron, an RAF gunner, but believed she had been rejected when her letters went unanswered. She says she recalls \"all of it\" - especially as the country pauses for reflection on Remembrance Day.\n\nPhyllis lived with her family in Suffolk before her move to Cambridge\n\nPhyllis met Ron on Torquay seafront when the country was on the brink of war in the summer of 1939 - but her mother forbade their courtship from the beginning. A few months later, she was sent off for Land Girl training, where Ron visited her and sent her coded letters in an attempt to outwit her mother. She was then assigned to a farm, where she was paid 32 shillings a week. \"I quite enjoyed it, apart from getting up at 04:30 - I wasn't too keen on that,\" she said. \"I lived six miles from the farm and at first I didn't live in. \"It was hard work; I milked the cows, then had breakfast, then clean their mess up, and there was field work. \"I learned to drive a tractor, I learned to go up and down and turn the earth.\"\n\nPhyllis said she had preferred the idea of working on the land to the possibility of being in a factory \"with all the bombs dropping\"\n\nThe couple reunited when he was on leave, but her mother's deception meant the relationship was doomed. At the time, her mother claimed Ron had come looking for her while she was staying with an aunt. Then the letters inexplicably stopped. \"My mum kept the letters from him because she wanted me to marry another chap,\" explained Phyllis. Advised by friends to \"love again\", she began seeing a wounded soldier called Norman, while still pining for Ron.\n\nShe eventually found all of Ron's letters while her wedding guests were waiting at the church. She said: \"She [my mother] gave me a letter from Ron on my wedding day, of all days, saying he was safe in France. I felt very angry and hurt. \"In those days, parents had more authority over you.\" Phyllis and Norman went on to have two daughters and two sons, and moved to Australia at a time when the Ten Pound Pom scheme enticed people to a new life Down Under. The family returned to Devon, with Phyllis eventually moving to Red Lodge, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, as a widow, to live with her son, Peter, and daughter-in-law Etwin.\n\nAbout 80,000 women worked for the Women's Land Army during World War Two\n\nSpeaking of Remembrance Day and the futility of war, she said she had lost many of her school friends during the conflict. \"Boys studied hard, left school, had a couple of jobs, got called up and got killed. It seemed a waste of life to me,\" she said. \"I remember all of it, especially night after night expecting to get bombed any minute, hearing planes going over. \"[Once], I was riding a bicycle to work, I heard sirens went and I was going to jump off and run in for shelter in the town hall. \"As he machine gunned across it went through my bicycle wheel and missed me entirely.\"\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Suffolk?",
    "Robbie Williams has hit back at comments made by former Take That manager Nigel Martin-Smith in a new BBC three-part documentary about the highs and lows of being in a boyband. Both have taken part in Boybands Forever, the first two episodes of which aired on Saturday. In one scene, Martin-Smith - who managed Take That in the 1990s - claims Williams was \u201csmart and quite clever\u201d to blame his drug-taking on being \u201cin this band where he couldn\u2019t have girlfriends or couldn\u2019t go out\u201d. But the singer, who quit the band in 1995, took issue with the assertions, posting a lengthy message on Instagram, external on Sunday.\n\nIn the documentary, Martin-Smith said Williams had made him out to be \"evil\" and had blamed him for some of his behaviour, including his drug-taking. Responding specifically to that point, Williams told his former manager: \u201cAllow me to respond to your assertion. My drug taking was never your fault. \"My response to the warped world that surrounded me is solely my own. How I chose to self-medicate is and was something that I will be monitoring and dealing with for the whole of my life. \"It's part of my make-up and I would have had the same malady had I been a taxi driver.\" Williams also said he wanted to remind Martin-Smith that he was just 16 when he joined the band, and 21 when he left. \"That was the last time I saw you. I hope I have more grace and understanding when and if any of my own four children at such a vulnerable age behave in the same manner.\" Williams, who has since forged a successful solo career, also used his post to speak more generally about the pressures of being in a boyband. \"Nearly all members of boybands it seems have at some point a mental breakdown,\" he said. \"Your young charge at this time in his life was experiencing his first. You didn't excel in man management and it was here that, instead of a stern word and a pointed finger, an arm around the shoulder and a kind word would have been the best tact.\" He added: \u201cIf you are following the story closely, you can\u2019t help but notice a pattern emerge. Boys join a boyband. The band becomes huge. Boys get sick. \"Some are fortunate through a series of self-examinations and help to overcome their experience. Some never quite manage to untangle the mess of the wreckage of the past. \u201cI\u2019m not breaking anyone\u2019s anonymity by sharing the side effects of boyband dysphoria that relate to just us lads.\" He outlined the struggles his bandmates have had in the past, including Gary Barlow's battles with an eating disorder and Mark Owen's struggles with alcohol abuse. Returning to his former manager, he told him he had \"deep admiration\" for his work and his ability to take big risks. But he added: \u201cNige, you continue to not come across as a relatable character and could do with a glow-up where redeemable features are concerned. Therefore you play into the narrative you don\u2019t want for yourself.\u201d He went on to urge Martin-Smith to take accountability and to \"admit your shortcomings\". The documentary, which reaches its conclusion this week, focuses on some of the biggest boybands to grace the charts during the 1990s and early 2000s.",

    "As people get richer in South East Asia, parents are increasingly turning to commercial food products to feed their babies\n\nJennylyn M Barrios\u2019 job as a make-up artist takes her all over Manila \u2013 precious time away from Uno, her 10-month-old son. There simply isn\u2019t enough time in the day to make the homemade meals her growing baby needs. But in rapidly developing Philippines, there are increasingly options for busy, working mums like her. \u201cIf I need to make something from scratch, I need to work double time before I finish the product,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut for Cerelac, I just need to add hot water and prepare the mix. I feed it three times a day \u2013 for breakfast, lunch, and then for dinner. It\u2019s easy to feed, available, affordable \u2013 all great for working mums.\u201d Jennylyn is one of many mums increasingly turning to commercially available baby food products in recent years: sales of instant cereals, porridges, pureed foods, pouches and snacks across South East Asia have doubled in five years. Cerelac - an instant porridge mix - is Nestle\u2019s biggest seller here, offering not only convenience but aspiration as well, all for an affordable price, a key consideration with a rise in cost of living. A quick search on social media shows a slew of aspirational mums with their smiling infants extolling its virtues - including offering some of the crucial nutrients growing children need. But while the product will be instantly recognisable to parents across the world, the ingredients here may not be. Because, along with the benefits of added micronutrients Cerelac offers parents in the Philippines and the UK, some flavours in the South East Asian nation offer something else: added sugar. And that, in a country where parents are increasingly turning from traditional diets to convenience foods, has health professionals worried.\n\nNestle dominates 98% of the baby food market in the Philippines\n\nIn the Philippines, Nestle says it follows a set of standards and guidelines from the Codex Commission \u2013 a collective established by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) consisting of food manufacturers, governments and UN agencies. \"The added sugar we have in our products are all well below the threshold prescribed by international and local guidelines who always follow the FDA, who follows Codex, and these are the experts in this field,\" said Arlene Tan-Bantoto, Nestl\u00e9 Nutrition business executive officer. But WHO has called the current standards inadequate and recommends they be updated with a particular focus on avoiding sugar and salt in any food for children under three. Yet a Unicef study of 1,600 baby foods across South East Asia found nearly half included added sugars and sweeteners. There is, says Ms Tan-Bantoto, a simple explanation for why it is needed in Cerelac in particular: to disguise the taste of crucial nutrients like iron, which has a metallic taste, and the brain nutrient, DHA, which smells like fish. \u201cMicronutrient deficiency is widespread in the country and we are serious in our efforts in alleviating it,\u201d said Ms Tan-Bantoto. \u201cNinety-seven percent of babies do not meet their daily nutrient requirement, 40% of babies, zero to five, suffer from iron deficiency anaemia. And we know that to be anaemic has lifelong consequences. For instance, brain development and next poor immunity and 20% of kids zero to five are stunted. That means we fortify our products.\u201d\n\u2022 None Sugar in first 1,000 days linked to poor health later\n\nAt a clinic in Manila, they see first-hand the impacts of malnutrition on babies and toddlers on a regular basis - although as diets change, so too is how the cases are presenting. \u201cSometimes they are underweight, some are overweight, and some are severely malnourished,\u201d one doctor told the BBC. It is impossible to say exactly why there has been a rise in overweight children. There are multiple factors in the rise of obesity \u2013 including a change in lifestyles and urbanisation. But nutritionists say taste preferences are developed at a young age and in some countries like in the Philippines, many foods catering to a sweet palate are started early. It is why the added sugar in a product like Cerelac is such a concern, according to public health experts like Dr Mianne Silvestre. The most popular flavour of Cerelac in the Philippines has about 17.5g of total sugars per serving \u2013 more than four teaspoons of sugar - but that can include both naturally occurring and added sugars. Nestle says in the Philippines, it has several variants or flavours without added sugar, and also flavours with added sugar. \u201cWe always mention that malnutrition isn't just being undernourished, it's also overnourished also overweight and obese children, and very difficult to diet,\u201d explains Dr Silvestre. \u201cStarting these babies so young on this level of sugar. It\u2019s mind-boggling.\u201d Unicef nutrition officer for the Philippines, Alice Nkoroi, says a lack of local, government regulation also puts parents at a distinct disadvantage. \u201cIf you go to other countries in Europe... they will have regulations that control what is sold out there and also make sure that companies put out what is they're clear on what is in the content and at the front of the pack, it's easy for the families and consumers to understand what is good for them and what is unhealthy,\u201d she points out. And it is not just what is in the product - or on the packaging - which needs regulating, she adds. \u201cWe conducted a digital scan... and what we saw is that families are bombarded 99% on what is on social media,\u201d Ms Nkoroi said. \u201cThere's a need for us to regulate what is coming out or being pushed out there in social media, especially targeted to children.\u201d\n\nMany influencers in the Philippines promote baby food products\n\nChiara Maganalles - or Mommy Diaries PH as she\u2019s known on social media - has 1.6 million Facebook followers. In a lively YouTube video for Nestle\u2019s \u201cParenteam\u201d educational platform, she tells tens of thousands of subscribers about the benefits of Cerelac. She\u2019s been promoting the product for years, and for her, it is a win-win. \u201cI mean with my first kid... I did feed her Cerelac first because it's convenient... It suits our budget... because of the nutritional content as well, it says that it's fortified with iron,\u201d she said. Influencing has also transformed Chiara\u2019s life \u2013 she\u2019s now able to support her family from the money she makes from brand deals. But critics say paid partnerships can look like trustworthy expert advice compared to conventional advertising methods. And what Chaira recommended - feeding Cerelac several times a day - goes even against what Nestle told the BBC. Ms Tan-Bantoto described it as a \u201ccomplementary\u201d food to a baby\u2019s diet, which should not be taken \u201cthe whole day\u201d. \u201cAt least give one bowl,\u201d she said, for the nutritional value. Nestle says it recommends one serving of infant cereal each day along with a diverse diet of foods, like fruits, vegetables, and meat daily. The company says the information is shared on its product labels, but promotional material on e-commerce sites and its educational platform suggest meal plans with Cerelac products up to three times a day.\n\nImee Marcos, sister of the current president, is sponsoring a bill that would criminalise added sugar in baby food\n\nThe demand for regulation in the Philippines does have some star power. The sister of the current president and daughter of former president Ferdinand Marcos Snr - Imee Marcos - is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit manufacturers of baby food from adding sugar in their products. A failure to comply could lead to a hefty fine, and imprisonment of producers and manufacturers for one to five years. \u201cI'm very hopeful that it will see the light of day. There's so many bills and the food lobbies, the huge multinationals that purvey all these foods are immensely powerful and until today I haven't even had a hearing,\u201d Senator Imee Marcos told the BBC. For its part Nestle says it is listening to concerns, and is phasing out added sugar in baby food - but that balancing the nutritional profile and composition of the product with taste takes time. The company's bestseller is due to get a sugar-free variety, with plans to completely eliminate all added sugar in the next \"two to three years\", Ms Tan-Bantoto said. Research published this week indicates that cutting sugar in the first 1,000 days of a baby's life - from conception to the age of two - appears to reduce the risk of developing significant health issues in adult life. A team of researchers at the University of Southern California found that limiting the intake of sugar in early life cut the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 35%, and high blood pressure by 20%. Experts believe the first 1,000 days of life are a crucial period which can shape a person's future health.",
    "Parkrun: The local jog that became a worldwide hit\n\nWake up, it's a beautiful morning: Saturdays have never been the same, some say\n\nWhen a small group of runners gathered on a chilly autumn morning in London 20 years ago, no-one could have realised they were taking part in something that would become an international hit. Green Day's album American Idiot had just reached number one, Ben Stiller's Dodgeball was showing in cinemas and the first series of Strictly Come Dancing had just finished. Organiser Paul Sinton-Hewitt enticed the pioneering 13 runners to turn up to what was then known as the Bushy Park Time Trial on 2 October 2004 after injury prevented him from taking part himself. \"It really affects people's lives so that goodness that exists in a park on a Saturday morning extends to the whole week,\" he says of an event with millions of weekly participants and volunteers.\n\nFounder Paul Sinton-Hewitt (right), leading the first Bushy Park Time Trial - the forerunner to Parkrun - in Richmond, south-west London\n\nFor the uninitiated, Parkrun sees people of all ages and abilities gather in an outdoor space at 09:00 or 09:30, depending on the location, on Saturdays and run for 5km - or just over three miles. Shorter 2km runs for children aged four to 14 and their families take place on Sunday mornings. By Christmas of 2004, the numbers had doubled and by the time of the 2012 Olympics the event had expanded to every London borough. Last month, Lithuania became the latest country to host a Parkrun, taking the overall tally of nations to 23. Ireland is the most popular place for Parkrun worldwide - where between 8-9% of the population are registered. In London, where it all began, there are now nearly 750,000 registered parkrunners (including Greater London) and about 100 events each weekend.\n\nBorn in Zimbabwe but raised in South Africa, Mr Sinton-Hewitt was given a CBE for services to grass-roots sport participation in 2014. Now happily living in rural Sussex, he says \"you get absorbed by the community, who make you feel special\". He said: \"Almost all the people I know have found that it's really welcoming. \"It's non-competitive. You can run it as hard as you like. You can be as competitive as you like but you're not really competing with other people. \"You're competing against yourself, and as a result, there's this pressure is taken away and it's just fun, right?\"\n\nAfe Komolafe has been to Parkrun in Sweden\n\nSix years ago, Afe Komolafe was pre-diabetic and started doing Parkrun near her home in Hayes, west London. The community engagement officer fell in love the weekly event and, after a brief break due to a knee injury, she now accompanies first-timers and even travels abroad with friends made at events for her Parkrun fix.\n\nShe said: \"Parkrun means a whole lot to me. It's community, friendship, health, well-being, fitness. \"It's just special. It's run by volunteers: there are no airs or graces about it. \"I've made so many friends through Parkrun.\" Nigel Rata, who has a PhD in atmospheric chemistry, has clocked up more than 200 events and tries to \"get a Parkrun in wherever I am\". The south Londoner describes it as a \"family\".\n\nHe said: \"There's no expectation of what you do when you get there. There's no expectation of performance... but fundamentally, it's there for me. \"You'll feel great afterwards, no matter how you feel going into it. \"Being with people being in the outdoors and getting fresh air in green spaces just works for me.\"\n\nSome Parkruns take place on beaches\n\nFor the man who started it all, arthritis in his left knee means he \"can still make my way around the course, but generally it's walking or I'm back volunteering\". Mr Sinton-Hewitt said: \"It helps me see the joys in life and and sets my my path out for the the rest of the week, so it's a very important part of my existence.\"",
    "Assisted dying bill: What is in proposed law?\n\nA proposed law to legalise assisted dying, external for terminally ill adults in England and Wales has been formally introduced in the House of Commons. MPs are due to debate and vote on the bill on 29 November - further debates and votes would be needed before the bill becomes law.\n\nThe bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life. But there are requirements:\n\u2022 None They must be resident of England and Wales and be registered with a GP for at least 12 months\n\u2022 None They must have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure\n\u2022 None They must be expected to die within six months\n\u2022 None They must make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die\n\u2022 None Two independent doctors must be satisfied the person is eligible - and there must be at least seven days between the doctors\u2019 assessments\n\u2022 None A High Court judge must hear from at least one of the doctors and can also question the dying person, or anyone else they consider appropriate. There must be a further 14 days after the judge has made the ruling\n\nUnder the bill, a doctor could prepare the substance, but the person themselves must take it. No doctor or anyone else would be allowed to administer the medication to the terminally ill person. Doctors would also not be under any obligation to take part in the assisted dying process. This is called physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia is different and is where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient.\n\nAnd as well as the list of requirements above, the bill would make it illegal for someone to pressure, coerce or use dishonesty to get someone to make a declaration that they wish to end their life or to induce someone to self-administer an approved substance. If someone is found guilty of either of these actions, they could face a jail sentence of up to 14 years.\n\nThe law would apply to England and Wales. A separate bill is already under discussion in Scotland. Meanwhile, politicians in Jersey and the Isle of Man have already backed plans to introduce assisted dying and the process to bring in legislation is under way.",
    "Karren Brady has been a football executive for 30 years\n\nThe government's proposed new football regulator would create a \"closed shop\" of top sides, West Ham United vice chair Karren Brady has warned. The Football Governance Bill, which would lead to the creation of a regulator, was debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday. Baroness Brady, who has held senior positions at clubs for 30 years, told peers there were \"dangers lurking in this bill\". \"Aspects of this legislation risks suffocating the very thing that makes English football so unique, the aspiration that allows clubs to rise and succeed in our pyramid system. The ambition that means fans can dream,\" she said. The government wants a regulator to be able to \"improve the resilience of club finances, tackle rogue owners and directors and strengthen fan engagement\". The bill was introduced after a similar measure by the previous government ran out of time to be made law before the general election. But Conservative peer Brady said planned \"extreme redistribution\" would \"replace our brilliant but brutal meritocracy with the likelihood of a closed shop where survival not aspiration becomes a ceiling\". Supporter groups and the English Football League are among those to have welcomed the bill, though the Premier League has insisted there is no need for an independent regulator.\n\n\"Irresponsible owners, unsuitable financial models and inadequate regulation have cast a shadow over too many of our clubs and too often it is fans who have had to fight to protect their club's identity, heritage and even its very existence,\" she said. \"The football industry has not gone far enough in tackling these issues, despite many opportunities to do so. That is why we are bringing forward this bill.\" Independent crossbench peer Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson was concerned by the lack of women's football as a consideration in the bill. \"There is an obvious exclusion and that is the women's game,\" the Paralympian said. \"If the aim of this bill is to ensure financial sustainability for the future of football, should this not be for the whole game? \"There will be many who will say that no regulator is required, but I believe that the exclusion of the women's game from this bill could actually hinder its growth, so that it will continue to be an afterthought when it should be at the forefront of football's innovation.\"",
    "In April, a fan approached American singer Gigi Perez after a show, and proudly showed off their latest tattoo. \"Gigi I \ud83d\udda4 U,\" read the ink. The singer was lost for words. \"In my head, I was like, \u2018Please don't regret that\u2019,'\" she laughs. \"It's hard for me to process that somebody else has my name permanently on their skin. \"But, I mean, it's just the ultimate honour to know that the music impacted them so greatly that they would do that.\" It was the first time anyone had felt passionately enough to turn her name into a tattoo - and the timing could not have been better. Six months earlier, Gigi been dropped by her record label, in the middle of a promotional trip to London. And after having to move back to her parents' house, in Florida, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter had to reassess her life. \"I was free falling,\" she says. \"I had no income, I was back home, and I was starting to doubt myself. \"But I was like, 'Let me just give myself a year to learn how to record and produce my own records. \"From there, if I need to get a job so I can still make music, I'll do that. \"And then everything happened...\" Everything, in case you have not been following Gigi's story, involved scoring a global hit single out of nowhere. Sailor Song, an aching love ballad about falling for a woman who looks like the actress Anne Hathaway, exploded online in June and quickly became a real-world success. In the UK, it went to number one, ending Sabrina Carpenter's nine-week run at the top. The song also reached the summit in Ireland and Latvia and made the top 10 everywhere from New Zealand to Belgium. \"I knew the song was special to me,\" Gigi says. \"I just didn't know it was going to be special to so many other people.\" When she found out it had reached number one, \"I got out of the shower and just started crying,\" Gigi told the UK's Official Charts Company., external\n\nBorn in New Jersey and raised in Florida, Gigi was a drama school nerd who turned to music when she realised she was \"never going to be cast in the ingenue role\". Self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the US streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, Sometimes (Backwood). The song earned her a contract with Interscope Records and Gigi supported Coldplay on their Music of the Spheres tour before she had even played a headline show of her own. Looking back, she says that initial wave of success created a pressure to expand her career too quickly. For a long time, she felt \"stuck and limited\" by her lack of progression. \"It was this cognitive dissonance where I\u2019d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be coming to the show,\" Gigi says. And by the time she played London last November, she knew she had reached breaking point. \"I asked God, or the universe, 'Open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,'\" she says. \"I knew it had to happen - but I was so terrified of what that meant.\"\n\nInterscope released her two days later. But instead of the world ending, Gigi's energy renewed. She wrote more songs - and taught herself how to produce them, by watching YouTube tutorials. Sailor Song came to her in a sudden burst of inspiration this February. \"I was on my bed, my door was open and I was just messing around, jamming,\" Gigi says. \"My little sister walked by, and she was like, \u2018Gigi, what was that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea, but I think it's really cool.'\" \"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\" She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone. In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love. But the chorus is undeniable. \"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\" Of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long. In the US, evangelical Christians criticised Sailor Song for the line: \"I don't believe in God, but you're my saviour.\" \"My songwriting is not a democracy,\" she wrote, \"and that applies to every artist's work.\"\n\nAfter the success of Sailor Song, the singer signed a new record deal, this time with Island Records\n\nHer parents became born-again Christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for Gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in Florida. The experience was not all positive. \"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022. Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020. The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever. In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable. \"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene. \"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\" Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\". \"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says. \"And so I made it for myself. \"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\" That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it. \"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says. \"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\" And with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before Gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms.",

    "Lori Chavez-Deremer, Lee Zeldin and Elise Stefanik were among those threatened\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees and picks for his White House team have been targeted by bomb threats. The FBI said it was aware of \"numerous bomb threats\" as well as \"swatting incidents\", in which hoax calls are made to attract a police response to the target's home. Threats were made against at least nine people chosen by Trump to lead the Departments of Defence, Housing, Agriculture and Labor, as well as his pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, among others. Police are investigating the incidents, which happened on Tuesday night and Wednesday.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said the Trump appointees \u201cwere targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them\u201d. She said \"law enforcement acted quickly to ensure\" the nominees' safety. \"With President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us,\u201d she said. Neither Leavitt nor the FBI identified any of the targets by name. New York Republican Elise Stefanik, who Trump has named to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, was the first to say her family home had been targeted by a bomb threat. Her office said the congresswoman was informed of the threat while she was driving with her husband and three-year-old son from Washington DC to New York for Thanksgiving. Defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth later confirmed that he was also targeted. On X, he said that a police officer had shown up at his home on Wednesday morning, as his seven children were sleeping inside to notify him they had received \"a credible pipe bomb threat\". \"I will not be bullied or intimidated. Never,\" he wrote. \"President Trump has called on me to serve - and that is what I intend to do.\u201d\n\u2022 None 'I had 60 seconds to protect my family': Swatting targets US politicians Trump, who survived two assassination attempts during his campaign, was not among those who received the hoax calls, law enforcement sources told US media. He has received genuine threats recently, according to officials in Arizona who arrested a man earlier this week for posting videos on a \"near-daily basis\" in which he threatened to kill Trump and his family. None of those targeted this week were protected by the US Secret Service, according to media reports.\n\nLee Zeldin, who Trump has nominated to become administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, also confirmed he was targeted, saying a \"pipe bomb threat\" was sent to his home with a \u201cpro-Palestinian themed message\u201d. \"My family and I were not home at the time and are safe,\" he said. \"We are thankful for the swift actions taken by local officers.\" Brooke Rollins, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Agriculture, posted on X to thank police in Fort Worth, Texas, for their \"swift efforts\" to investigate a threat to her family on Wednesday morning. \"We were unharmed and quickly returned home,\" she wrote. Scott Turner, Trump\u2019s pick for Department of Housing, and Lori Chavez-Deremer, his pick for Labour Secretary, also posted on social media that they had been targeted. They each vowed that they would not be deterred by the threats. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the incidents, the White House said in a statement. \"The White House is in touch with federal law enforcement and the President-elect\u2019s team, and continues to monitor the situation closely.\" US Capitol Police, which protects Congress, said in the statement that it was working with federal law enforcement agencies on any \"swatting\", but declined to provide further details \"to minimise the risk of copy-cats\". Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, who recently dropped out of the running to become US attorney general, was also targeted. The sheriff's office in Florida's Okaloosa County confirmed that a bomb threat targeted an address in the town of Niceville. The home's mailbox was cleared and no devices were located, police said, and a search of the area did not uncover anything. New York police told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the New York home of Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was also threatened. Pam Bondi, who was selected to replace Gaetz as Trump's nominee, was also targeted along with incoming White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, according to CBS. Fox News reports that John Ratcliffe, Trump's nominee to be director of the CIA, also received threats. Similar hoax tactics have been recently used against other high-profile political figures, including against the judges and prosecutors who oversaw the criminal cases against Trump. Last year, US politicians around the country were swatted over Christmas. Most were Republican, but some Democrats were targeted as well.",
    "Katie Boulter is aiming for a third WTA title of the season\n\nBritish number ones Katie Boulter and Jack Draper each reached another quarter-final as they look to finish their respective career-best seasons strongly. Boulter reached her fourth WTA Tour quarter-final of the year by sweeping aside Japan's Kyoka Okamura in the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. The 28-year-old won 6-1 6-2 against 271st-ranked Okamura, who lost in qualifying but was placed in the main draw as a lucky loser. Draper, 22, moved into the last eight of the Erste Bank Open in Vienna with a 7-5 6-1 victory over Italy's Luciano Darderi. US Open semi-finalist Draper will contest his ninth ATP quarter-final of 2024 after a strong serving performance which allowed Darderi little opportunity to break.\n\nBoulter is ranked 33rd in the world after a year which has yielded two WTA titles and a breakthrough into the top 30. While she has been unable to go past the third round of a major, Boulter has regularly asserted her authority with her powerful baseline game. That is what happened in Tokyo as the gulf between Boulter and Okamura showed. Providing greater consistency from the baseline, and showing glimpses of craft, Boulter's level was too much for Okamura to handle. \"I'm playing some good tennis,\" said Boulter, who reached her first quarter-final since Eastbourne in June. The clinical victory sets up an intriguing clash with Canadian wildcard Bianca Andreescu. Andreescu, 24, won the 2019 US Open as a teenager but has been plagued by injury problems since. \"It's a free swing for me at the end of the year and I have nothing to lose,\" said Boulter, who has no ranking points to defend and could move back into the top 30 this week.\n\nLike Boulter, Draper is aiming to finish the finest year of his career with a flourish. The left-hander has climbed into the world's top 20, aided by greater physical robustness and playing his most matches in a single season as a result. Making sensible decisions based on listening to his body has also been beneficial. Draper had not played for a month before this week, having pulled out of Shanghai as a precaution with an abdominal injury suffered the week before in Tokyo. That came after he raised concerns about the scheduling demands put on players. \"I feel really good. I didn't know what to expect coming out after being injured and I was ill for a week,\" said Draper, who plays Czech Tomas Machac next. \"Potentially I was going to be rusty and not feeling good but I've been really strong.\" Looking refreshed and sharp, Draper had to be patient before wearing down Darderi. Draper broke serve for a 6-5 lead and fired down four aces in the next game to seal the opening set, having won all 21 points on first serve. In the second set Draper continued to play aggressively and confidently as a frustrated Darderi unravelled.",
    "'Will to attack lifts Scotland from Euros gloom'\n\nSteve Clarke joins in the celebrations after a dramatic 2-1 win over Poland\n\nA jubilant Steve Clarke skipped into the media room in Warsaw on Monday night, high-fived the press pack he loves so much and then opened his heart about what victory over Poland meant to him on a personal level. A tear trickled down the cheek of the Scotland manager. He apologised for being so emotional. That late winner from Andy Robertson had broken down the walls of his stoicism. \"We\u2019re back,\" he sobbed. \"And you can write that.\" Actually, no. That's not what happened at all. Clarke behaved in exactly the same way he does in defeat. Same unreadable expression (with an occasional flickering smile), same measured tone. Never too high, never too low, never a headline in his words if he can help it. The manager might be heroically deadpan but that doesn't matter so much when his team is so rent with drama, so insistent on taking their fans on wild flights from joy to concern to despair and anger, to hope and then back to joy again. The pitchforks that were out for Clarke in the wake of the Euros can now be decommissioned. Put out the bonfires. Cancel the wake. There's an evolution going on here, not a footballing execution. After a performance against Hungary at the Euros that was bankrupt of any redeeming features, Scotland have just put in six good performances in a row in the Nations League, none of them involving Kieran Tierney, Aaron Hickey, Nathan Patterson and Lewis Ferguson. We've seen Cristiano Ronaldo flounce his way out of Hampden. We've seen the previously emotionless Luka Modric losing the plot. We've seen Josko Gvardiol, one of the best defenders in Europe, tormented by a teenager and we have seen the beginnings of a Scottish revival.\n\nIn a group that left them sickened by late goals against Poland at Hampden and against Portugal in Lisbon, there was a certain poetry about John McGinn\u2019s 86th-minute winner against Croatia and Andy Robertson\u2019s 92nd-minute winner against Poland. Resilience has been the watchword of Clarke and his players. They get knocked down, but they get up again. Craig Gordon was supposed to have played his last game for Scotland in June, but he's first choice again. Clarke picked five centre-backs for the Euros and John Souttar wasn't one of them. Souttar has been terrific in this campaign, rounding it off with a sensational goalline block and a majestic cross for Robertson's goal. Anthony Ralston has been regularly pilloried since being pitched into an unfamiliar wing-back role against the dovetailing Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala in Munich, but Celtic\u2019s reserve right-back has been strong in the face of so much flak. In turning the Scotland ship around, no player has had to dig deeper than Ralston. Clarke is not the type of character to dwell on the lessons learned at the Euros for fear of inviting a public inquisition that he has no desire to be part of. But he has tweaked his thinking in these past six games, particularly against Poland. There was no comparison between the attacking Scotland in the final game of their Nations League group campaign and the cautious Scotland in the last match of their dismal Euros experience. In Germany, zero shots on target against Hungary (zero against Germany and only three against Switzerland). In Poland, seven shots on target, two goals, plus two off the woodwork. Moldova in June 2022 was the last time Clarke's team had as many attempts on target.\n\nDoak turned in a good first half against Poland after an electric spell in the second half against Croatia\n\nScotland are now chasing away the desperate fatalism that gripped the nation after that loss to Hungary and during the epic run of one win in 16 games, but there's a lot left to be done. The League A relegation play-off in March for starters. For seconds, a World Cup qualifying campaign that will require luck in the draw to navigate. How will things be looking come March? Scotland have a goalscoring legend in McGinn and a steady contributor in Scott McTominay, but they still only finished with seven goals from six Nations League games. The lack of a striker is still the great bugbear. Che Adams, Lyndon Dykes, Lawrence Shankland and Tommy Conway all had a crack at it. They all work hard, they're all capable of playing their part in creating chances for the midfielders, but none of them scored in the Nations League. That's a problem without a solution right now. There's nobody coming through. Clarke always says that it doesn't really matter where the goals come from as long as they come. And he's right. For Scotland to progress to the next level, though, you suspect that they're going to need more creativity and more ruthlessness up front. The emergence of Ben Doak, therefore, has been a thrilling step in the right direction. The contributions from Ryan Gauld from the bench have also been noteworthy. Scotland have a long way to go on the offensive side but the Poland game showed that there's a will to attack now which wasn't really there in the dispiriting summer in Germany. Being so competitive in six League A games against stellar opposition can only help Scotland mature. Things will get really interesting when some of the injured stars return to the fold. They might get more interesting again if the young thruster Lennon Miller keeps progressing so rapidly. A team that began with worrying losses on the road to Germany before disappearing down a dead end at the tournament proper has reversed out of the darkness and appears to be heading for the light again. The Nations League relegation tussle and the World Cup qualifiers will be the ultimate proof of that, but at least Clarke can take comfort from the fact that even his most excitable critics have fallen relatively silent for now. That's if he ever cared about the noise in the first place, which is doubtful.",

Hurricane Helene: North Carolina building flows down river and smashes into debris\n\nThe death toll from Hurricane Helene has surpassed 200 as rescuers continue to search for survivors from the storm that tore across the US south-east. More than half of the deaths were in North Carolina, where entire communities were uprooted and devastated by the deadliest mainland storm since Katrina in 2005, which killed more than 1,800 people. Hundreds of people are still missing and 780,000 homes were without power nearly a week after Helene made landfall. The rising death toll comes as President Joe Biden continues his two-day tour of the area visiting Florida and Georgia on Thursday.\n\nBiden received an aerial tour of the damage in Tallahassee, Florida, on Thursday where the hurricane made landfall as a category four storm last week. Speaking later in Ray City, Georgia, Biden told residents: \u201cI see you, I hear you, I grieve with you, and I promise you we have your back. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay until you\u2019re restored.\u201d The president has approved federal disaster assistance for survivors in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Tens of thousands of people have no running water in North Carolina, which has seen some of the most severe impacts of the storm, particularly in the mountainous area of Asheville. \u201cI feel like I just survived the apocalypse,\u201d Nicole Rojas, a Vilas, North Carolina, resident told the BBC. An elderly couple, Jerry and Marcia Savage, died in bed when a tree fell on their home in South Carolina, their grandson told the Associated Press news agency. He said they were found hugging one another. Hundreds of roads remain closed, hampering efforts to send aid to hard-hit communities. Private citizens have been helping distribute aid in a variety of ways, including by mule and privately owned helicopters. Mountain Mule Packer Ranch has deployed a team of mules to help carry thousands of supplies into remote communities. The \"sure-footed\" pack animals are familiar with backcountry trails, and can travel on broken asphalt in ways that vehicles cannot, says mule-packer Michele Toberer. \"They are perfectly prepared for the conditions of the mountains,\" she says. So far, the team of nine mules has delivered hundreds of pounds of insulin, baby formula, nappies, canned food, cleaning supplies, and animal feed, she tells BBC News, adding that the biggest challenge they've faced so far is from the deep mud left behind by the floods.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNorth Carolina prisons on Wednesday relocated 800 inmates due to lack of power and running water, according to the state's department of corrections. Over 2,000 prisoners were relocated from other prisons earlier this week. Family members of prisoners told the Asheville Citizen-Times, external newspaper that they haven't been able to contact their loved ones for more than a week. More than 6,700 Army and Air National Guard members from 16 states are assisting with the on-the-ground response, according to the National Guard. The president deployed 1,000 active-duty soldiers to help with the aid efforts.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump toured damaged areas in Georgia earlier in the week. More rainfall is expected in the coming days in parts of the Gulf Coast and Florida, which could complicate the recovery efforts. US Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas warned earlier in the week that if another storm struck the US in the coming months, the Federal Emergency Management Agency would struggle to provide assistance. The Biden administration has shipped more than 8.8 million meals, 7.4 million litres of water, 150 generators and 225,000 tarps to the region, Mr Mayorkas said. The Atlantic hurricane season continues until the end of November, and two more storms are currently brewing.

    "Lineker: It is 'right time' to leave Match of the Day\n\nLineker will stay on the BBC to front coverage of next season's FA Cup\n\nGary Lineker has said it is \"the right time\" for another presenter to take on hosting Match of the Day, as the BBC looks to do the football programme \"slightly differently\" in the future. Earlier this week, Lineker announced he will step down from the show at the end of this season after 25 years as host. A new four-year deal for the BBC to air Premier League highlights will begin next season. \"I feel this is now the right time,\" Lineker said of his decision. \"I think [with] the next [highlights] contract, they're looking to do Match of the Day slightly differently, so I think it makes sense for someone else to take the helm.\"\n\nAfter leaving Match of the Day, Lineker will stay with the BBC to front coverage of next season's FA Cup and the 2026 men's World Cup. Speaking on his podcast The Rest Is Football, he said this week's announcement was \"basically news of an extra year contract\" for him at the BBC. \"I always thought my next thing would be the end. I've been thinking about it for a long time. I've done Match of Day for 25 years. It's been an absolute joy and a privilege to present such an iconic show for the BBC. \"But all things have to come to an end.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

So you've not quite got rid of me just yet.\" Speaking to co-hosts Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, he added that he will be 65 when his BBC work ends. \"So it's pension time.\"\n\nHe thanked viewers for the messages he had received, and noted that \"so many kind\" articles had been published. \"It did feel like I'd died and I was seeing my obituaries early. But it's nice. It's been lovely. And everywhere I go, people are saying lovely things. \"It's a bit like in football - Alan and myself, with England, you bowed out when you thought it was the right time, I bowed out of my football career when I felt it was the right time. And I feel this is now the right time.\" The former England striker joked: \"During my football career, I felt I was born to be in the box. And then I had to really learn to be on the box. And to be honest, at my age, it won't be long until I'm in a box.\" He said he would \"probably get a little bit emotional towards the end\" of his BBC career, but that he's \"quite calm at the moment\". \"It's been a bit bonkers and a bit mad,\" he continued. \"But I didn't think it would be quite the big deal that it was because it's just a guy that's done a TV show for a long time. It's nothing more than that really.\"\n\nLineker's successor on Match of the Day has not been announced, and he said he would \"never tell publicly my preference\" to be the new host. \"But whoever it is, I would say, be yourself... Just be yourself and and enjoy it. It's a wonderful programme to be part of. \"It was brilliant before I took over and it will be brilliant after I leave. So I would just say that, really - enjoy it, live it, and be yourself.\" Lineker said he was now looking forward to getting to bed earlier on a Saturday night. \"I'll go out for dinner, and you know what? I might be in bed before midnight. I'll still watch Match of the Day, but I'll be in bed straight after it, rather than the three-hour journey home. \"So yeah, I look back and it's been an amazing experience, and I feel incredibly fortunate.\"",
    "Why even at 20 you should care about pension changes\n\nThere is growing speculation that the way pensions are taxed could be changed in the Budget. Chancellor Rachel Reeves says she needs to find \u00a322bn and some experts say she could change the system on workplace or private pensions to find some of this money. This is separate from another debate about the state pension. There are a number of options which could affect workers getting their first job, those already working, all the way up to those in retirement. This is what could happen and why you should care even if you're only in your 20s.\n\nWhen you get paid, national insurance (NI) is deducted and the government spends it on things like benefits and public services. Your employer has to pay a NI contribution too. However, money that goes into a pension is free from income tax and NI. One option for the chancellor is to make employers pay at least some NI on the money they put into workers' pensions. Doing so could immediately raise billions of pounds for the government. However, this extra cost to business owners could leave them with less money to spend on hiring and investing. It could therefore become harder to get a job. Businesses could also limit pay rises, hitting all their workers, or reduce the pension contributions they make for new staff. Alternatively, employers who currently make the most of the NI break by encouraging workers to take less in pay and more in pension - known as salary sacrifice - could be stopped from doing so. The attraction of this option for Ms Reeves is that she can raise money without a visible difference to people's take-home pay. The downside is it creates less of an incentive for employers to put money into their staff's pensions. That would mean when current workers retire they wouldn't have as much income.\n\nVarious rules exist when inheriting money from partners or parents when they die. Inheritance tax , externalis paid if an estate is valued at more than \u00a3325,000 but any money saved in a pension does not count towards this. Separately, anyone who dies before the age of 75 can usually pass on what is left of their pension savings tax-free as a lump sum, or an income. If they are 75 or older when they die, their pension money can still be passed on, but it is treated as income and the person they leave it to may have to pay income tax. There is more on these rules here., external\n\nRemoving these tax breaks would give the government more money, but exactly how much is unclear. The vast majority of people don't pay inheritance tax anyway because they are not left estates worth more than \u00a3325,000. There could also be anger from people who have organised their finances under the current rules, only to find their loved ones would get a lot less if those rules changed. That anger would be even greater among those who have already retired, as they have less time to do much about it.\n\nFrom the age of 55 (or 57 from 2028), anyone with pension savings can take a quarter of their money as a tax-free lump sum up to a maximum of \u00a3268,275. Some use that money to pay off their own mortgage, if they have one. Others use it to help children and grandchildren buy a first home. The chancellor is said to be considering lowering the cap. By reducing the tax-free limit, people will eventually pay more in income tax when they take their pension. However, there are questions over how much extra money that would raise for the government and when. Making arrangements for those who have already exceeded the limit, or were planning to, could also be complex, and reduce how much extra tax the Treasury gets.\n\nThe build-up to every Budget usually sees speculation about changing pension tax relief, external. When you pay into a pension, some of the money that would have gone to the government in tax goes into your retirement savings instead, known as pension tax relief. You don't pay tax when putting money into a pension but you do when you come to take that money as income. Under the current system, you receive pension tax relief at the same rate as your income tax bracket - meaning basic rate taxpayers receive relief at 20%. That means for higher rate taxpayers, the relief is more generous, at 40% or 45% in line with your income tax rate. You can read more about how this is done here, external.\n\nSome economists say it would be fairer to give the same level of relief for everyone. Setting a flat-rate of relief at, say 25%, could benefit lower-earning employees who currently get 20% relief, by further reducing their tax bill. However, higher rate taxpayers with an annual income of about \u00a350,000 or more would lose out, because tax relief would be lower than now. An added, but important, complication is that a huge group of public sector workers, and some in the private sector too, have so-called defined benefit (DB) pensions, external. Ensuring the correct level of tax relief is applied to higher-rate taxpayers with these pensions would be highly complex. It may mean they are automatically given 40% or 45% tax relief, then later handed a tax bill - possibly for thousands of pounds - to pay some of that back. Tom Selby, from investment platform AJ Bell, says this would likely provoke \"a blistering row\" with NHS staff, teachers and civil servants who could fall into this bracket. Given that ministers have said they will not raise taxes for working people, that would become a tricky policy to sell - and reports suggest changes have now been ruled out by the Treasury.",
    "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said. Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said. The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.\n\nHealth ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK. Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021. In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.\n\nThe demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients. But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector. And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021. She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed. \u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said. In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals. That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nLater in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country. By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers. But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space. Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said. \u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.\n\nMs Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients. Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m. The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave. In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic. The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city. Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time. \u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

The Swan auction house, in Tetsworth, Oxfordshire, had listed objects including skulls, shrunken heads and other remains originating from communities across the globe. Laura Van Broekhoven, who is the director of the Pitt Rivers Museum, in Oxford, said she was \"outraged\" at the auction, and praised the decision to remove the remains from sale. The Swan has been approached by the BBC for comment.\n\nProfessor Van Broekhoven told the BBC that the sale was \"ethically really problematic\" for many communities worldwide. \"The fact these objects were taken is really painful, and the fact that they were being put on sale is really disrespectful and inconsiderate,\" she said.\n\nLaura Van Broekhoven is the director of Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum\n\n\"We're conscious that the remains would have been collected in the 19th and 20th centuries, but for them to be on sale in 2024 was quite shocking.\" Among the items initially listed were shrunken heads from the Jivaro people of South America, skulls from the Ekoi people of West Africa and a 19th century horned human skull from the Naga people of India and Myanmar. This led to the Forum for Naga Reconciliation (FNR) directly contacting the auction house to condemn the sale and to call for the object to be repatriated. The FNR is one of many indigenous groups around the world that is currently in dialogue with the Pitt Rivers about artefacts held in the museum's collection. \"We are currently reaching out to communities that we have these human remains, and they can tell us how they would like us to care for them or if they would like them to be repatriated,\" Prof Van Broekhoven said. \"All of that is possible when they're held in public collections like ours - we can be held accountable, whereas once they go up for auction, they're out of public use and there's no way for a community to be in contact.\" She added that she \"commended\" the auction house's decision to remove the remains from sale - but questioned what would now happen to them.\n\nDo you have a story BBC Oxfordshire should cover?",

    "Wasps secure land to build new stadium in Kent\n\nSix-time Premiership champions Wasps went into administration in 2022\n\nFormer Premiership club Wasps have moved a step closer to a return to professional rugby by securing land to build a new stadium in Kent. The six-time Premiership title winners were relegated after going into administration two years ago with debts of \u00a395m. They were then subsequently barred from competing in the Championship last season but have applied to re-enter the second tier for 2025-26. Club owner Christopher Holland said the club had secured a 10-year option on private land in Pedham Place as part of a wider development scheme south of Swanley, Kent. \"It is rewarding that we have managed to achieve this milestone with the support of key stakeholders,\" he said. \"It brings our aspiration of a new home in the region closer and hopefully demonstrates our determination to recover Wasps sustainably.\" Sevenoaks District Council said the stadium development on the outskirts of Swanley had been promoted by the club as part of the area's new local plan and the public would be able to have their say before the plan is finalised. \"Further down the line, the Wasps proposals would require planning consent, which again would give the public an opportunity to have their say and actively engage in the process,\" a council spokesman said. Mr Holland told BBC Sport \"with the best will in the world, it's going to be four years\" before the proposed new stadium would be finished and the club aimed to have plans ready some time next year.\n\nWasps won seven trophies in a prolific six-year spell from 2002 to 2008\n\nThe Premiership was cut from 13 clubs to 10 in the space of one season as Worcester Warriors, London Irish and Wasps all buckled under financial strain. Wasps were once a powerhouse of English rugby, winning seven trophies in a glorious six-season spell from 2002 to 2008 with players including England World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Josh Lewsey and Joe Worsley. The club claimed three consecutive Premiership titles between 2003 and 2005, achieving a league and European Champions Cup double in 2003-04. Originally a north-west London club based in Sudbury, they shared Queens Park Rangers' home at Loftus Road, Shepherds Bush from 1996 to 2002, when they moved to groundshare with Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park. In 2014, the club then relocated to the Midlands, quickly becoming ground owners at the Ricoh Arena - and landlords to Coventry City, the club for whom the stadium was built. Wasps were suspended in October 2022 before going into administration a week later and making 167 players and staff redundant. Worcester's vacated Sixways had been an option for Wasps to return to playing competitive rugby but in October 2023 Holland said the owners were determined to return the club to the south east.",
    "The new version of Sweden's pamphlet \"In case of crisis or war\" will reach letterboxes from Monday\n\nOn Monday, millions of Swedes will start receiving copies of a pamphlet advising the population how to prepare and cope in the event of war or another unexpected crisis. \u201cIn case of crisis or war\u201d has been updated from six years ago, external because of what the government in Stockholm calls the worsening security situation, by which it means Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The booklet is also twice the size. Neighbouring Finland has also just published its own fresh advice online on \u201cpreparing for incidents and crises\u201d. And Norwegians have also recently received a pamphlet, external urging them to be prepared to manage on their own for a week in the event of extreme weather, war and other threats.\n\nDuring the summer, Denmark's emergency management agency, external said it was emailing Danish adults details on the water, food and medicine they would need to get through a crisis for three days. In a detailed section on military conflict, the Finnish digital brochure, external explains how the government and president would respond in the event of an armed attack, stressing that Finland\u2019s authorities are \u201cwell prepared for self defence\u201d. Sweden joined Nato only this year, deciding like Finland to apply after Moscow expanded its war in 2022. Norway was a founder member of the Western defensive alliance. Unlike Sweden and Norway, the Helsinki government has decided not to print a copy for every home as it \u201cwould cost millions\u201d and a digital version could be updated more easily. \u201cWe have sent out 2.2 million paper copies, one for each household in Norway,\u201d said Tore Kamfjord, who is responsible for the campaign of self-preparedness at the Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB).\n\nIncluded in the lists of items to be kept at home are long-life foods such as tins of beans, energy bars and pasta, and medicines including iodine tablets in case of a nuclear accident. Oslo sent out an earlier version in 2018, but Kamfjord said climate change and more extreme weather events such as floods and landslides had brought increased risks. For Swedes, the idea of a civil emergency booklet is nothing new. The first edition of \u201cIf War Comes\u201d was produced during World War Two and it was updated during the Cold War. But one message has been moved up from the middle of the booklet: \u201cIf Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false.\u201d It was not long ago that Finland and Sweden were still neutral states, although their infrastructure and \u201ctotal defence system\u201d date back to the Cold War.\n\nSweden\u2019s Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said last month that as the global context had changed, information to Swedish households had to reflect the changes too. Earlier this year he warned that \u201cthere could be war in Sweden\u201d, although that was seen as a wake-up call because he felt that moves towards rebuilding that \u201ctotal defence\u201d were progressing too slowly. Because of its long border with Russia and its experience of war with the Soviet Union in World War Two, Finland has always maintained a high level of defence. Sweden, however, scaled down its infrastructure and only in recent years started gearing up again. \u201cFrom the Finnish perspective, this is a bit strange,\u201d according to Ilmari Kaihko, associate professor of war studies at the Swedish Defence University. \u201c[Finland] never forgot that war is a possibility, whereas in Sweden, people had to be shaken up a bit to understand that this can actually happen,\" says Kaihko, who's from Finland. Melissa Eve Ajosmaki, 24, who is originally from Finland but studies in Gothenburg, says she felt more worried when the war broke out in Ukraine. \u201cNow I feel less worried but I still have the thought at the back of my head on what I should do if there was a war. Especially as I have my family back in Finland.\"\n\nThe guides include instructions on what to do in case of several scenarios and ask citizens to make sure they can fend for themselves, at least initially, in case of a crisis situation. Finns are asked how they would cope without power for days on end with winter temperatures as low as -20C. Their checklist also includes iodine tablets, as well as easy-to-cook food, pet food and a backup power supply. The Swedish checklist recommends potatoes, cabbage, carrots and eggs along with tins of bolognese sauce and prepared blueberry and rosehip soup. Swedish Economist Ingemar Gustafsson, 67, recalls receiving previous versions of the pamphlet: \u201cI'm not that worried about the whole thing so I take it pretty calmly. It's good that we get information about how we should act and how we should prepare, but it's not like I have all those preparations at home\u201d. One of the most important recommendations is to keep enough food and drinking water for 72 hours. But Ilmari Kaihko wonders whether that is practical for everyone. \u201cWhere do you stash it if you have a big family living in a small apartment?\u201d",

His coffin, flown from North Macedonia, was greeted by members of his family, new Alba Party leader Kenny MacAskill and a lone piper. It was placed in a hearse before a cort\u00e8ge started the journey to Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire. The private plane, paid for by Scottish businessman and philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter, landed just before 14:00.\n\nFamily and friends gathered on the runway as the coffin was taken from the plane\n\nMr Salmond's wife Moira was sitting inside a funeral car during the short ceremony at the airport. A small group of people with saltire flags had gathered near the terminal building ahead of the flight's arrival. A group of Scottish independence supporting 'Yes Bikers' led the cort\u00e8ge to a funeral home in Fraserburgh. A private family service will be held on a date that has not yet been confirmed. A public memorial will follow at a later date.\n\nA group of Yes bikers led the cort\u00e8ge as it headed for Fraserburgh\n\nBefore being placed on the aircraft, Mr Salmond's coffin had been draped in a Saltire by Alba party colleague Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. The coffin was given a guard of honour and carried by members of the Macedonian military. A group of delegates including Ahmed-Sheikh looked on as the flight took off from Ohrid airport.\n\nMr Salmond had been at an Academy for Cultural Diplomacy conference in North Macedonia on Saturday when he had a heart attack during lunch with other delegates. Paramedics were called and attempts were made to revive him using CPR, but failed. He died age 69. His wife Moira, his sisters Margaret and Gail, his brother Bob and his nieces and nephews released a statement after his death which praised him as \"a devoted and loving husband, a fiercely loyal brother, a proud and thoughtful uncle and a faithful and trusted friend\".\n\nKenny MacKaskill with family and friends look on as the coffin is moved into Fraserburgh Funeral Services\n\nKenny MacAskill said the North Macedonian government had paid Mr Salmond a fitting tribute as he made his final journey home. He spoke to a small crowd of well-wishers in Fraserburgh who turned out to see the coffin arrive. Earlier this week he said the Salmond family had asked that their privacy be respected and that they would announce funeral arrangements and details of a memorial service in due course. First Minister John Swinney has lodged a motion of condolence at Holyrood, while books of condolence have been opened in the Scottish Parliament for MSPs and members of the public to leave messages. Businessman Sir Tom Hunter, said he was apolitical and disagreed with Salmond on some of his ambitions, but said he funded the flight because he \"deserved the dignity and privacy\" of a private return home.\n\nA coffin draped in the Saltire. Not for the return of a prince, a president or a prime minister. It was not the remains of a fallen soldier brought home to Scotland today. This was the repatriation of a political fighter and former first minister \u2014 perhaps the most formidable champion of Scottish independence in recent times. As the coffin bearing Alex Salmond\u2019s body was flown home by charter plane from North Macedonia - there were hints of a state occasion. The honour guard and the red carpet on departure, the piper on arrival at Aberdeen. But Mr Salmond was a private citizen. His flight home a gift from the businessman, Sir Tom Hunter. This was principally a family reunion to which the TV cameras were permitted. The former first minister did not live to see his dream of Scottish statehood. The referendum, a decade ago, was the peak of his political career. The independence question he did so much to animate may or may not be revisited in future but with his passing, it is now for others to carry that torch.",

    "MPs have backed plans to get rid of all hereditary peers from the House of Lords. A bill making its way through Parliament would abolish the 92 seats reserved for peers who inherit their titles through their families. MPs voted for the government proposals by 435 votes to 73. The bill will now go to the Lords, where it is expected to face tough opposition. The Conservatives opposed the plans, with shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart claiming the government was \"seeking to remove established scrutineers in order to replace them with Labour appointees\".\n\nBut during a debate in the Commons, some MPs also called for the government to go further. Conservative Sir Gavin Williamson put forward proposals for Church of England bishops to be removed from the Lords but these were rejected by MPs. He argued it was \"fundamentally unfair\" for a block of clerics to \"have a right and a say over our legislation\". \"For me, as someone who is an Anglican, I cannot see why I have a greater right for greater representation than my children who are Catholics,\" he said. He added that the 26 bishops in the Lords only come from England and are \"probably not reflective of today's world\". Liberal Democrat spokesperson Sarah Olney called the proposals \u201ca welcome step forward\u201d, adding that her party supports them. She urged the government to be \u201cbolder\u201d and support Lib Dem plans for an elected House of Lords. SNP MP Pete Wishart also called for the unelected House of Lords to be abolished completely, adding that \"if you represent the people, you should be voted by the people\". He told the Commons the government's proposals were \"pathetic\" and \"should have been done centuries ago\".\n\nAs well as promising to bring about \"immediate modernisation\" to the Lords by abolishing hereditary peers, Labour's general election manifesto pledged to introduce a mandatory retirement age of 80 for members of the upper house. It also said the party was committed to replacing the House of Lords with \"an alternative second chamber that is more representative of the regions and nations\". But these changes are not included in the bill and the government has not set out a timeline for when they will be delivered. Defending the government's approach, Cabinet Office minister Ellie Reeves said previous attempts to reform the Lords \"all in one go\" had failed and the government wanted to see \"immediate reform\". She added that the government would then consult on how to deliver its other manifesto commitments on the House of Lords. Reeves said the government \"values the good work done by hereditary peers\" but the bill was \"a matter of principle\". \"In the 21st Century it cannot be right for there to be places in our legislature reserved for those born into certain families,\" she told the Commons. Meanwhile, peers were also taking part in their own debate on the issue of Lords reform. Conservative peer Lord True was among those to criticise the government's plans. The shadow leader of the House of Lords argued the aim of the bill was \"partisan\" removing \"88 peers who do not align themselves with Labour and four who do\". He also said the move would cause \"great hurt\". \"The execution will have to be done at close quarters, brushing shoulders in the lobbies as we go to vote for the removal of much-respected colleagues.\" Fellow Conservative peer and former cabinet minister Lord Forsyth of Drumlean accused Labour of \"a disgraceful piece of political gerrymandering\" aimed at \"weakening the scrutiny\" of the government. \"If the party opposite continues with this act of constitutional vandalism they ain't seen nothing yet,\" he warned. The job of the House of Lords is to scrutinise the work of government and recommend changes to proposed legislation. Most peers are appointed by the monarch on the prime minister's advice. The majority of hereditary peers were abolished in 1999 under the last Labour government, leaving only 92 in a compromise deal with the Conservatives.",
    "Neil Foden was convicted of 12 counts of sexual activity with a child, and two of sexual activity with a child while he was in a position of trust\n\nTwo suspensions have been made at a school where the former headmaster was jailed for sexually abusing girls, governors confirmed in a letter to parents. The suspensions were made at Ysgol Friars in Bangor, because of information brought to the attention of local authority Cyngor Gwynedd\u2019s education department. Neil Foden was headteacher at Ysgol Friars and was also a strategic headteacher at Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle in Penygroes. He was jailed for 17 years in July after sexually abusing four girls over a period of four years.\n\nIt is not known what information has been seen by education officials resulting in the two suspensions. A joint statement by Cyngor Gwynedd and the Ysgol Friars board of governors states that suspension from work is a \u201cneutral act\u201d, so that investigations can be carried out \u201cthoroughly and in an appropriate manner\u201d.

    "Tesla boss Elon Musk has unveiled the firm's long-awaited robotaxi, the Cybercab, at the Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California. The futuristic-looking vehicle, featuring two wing-like doors - and no pedals or steering wheel - deposited Mr Musk in front of an audience eager to hear details about a project he considers key to Tesla's next chapter. At the event, billed \"We, Robot,\" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides. However, investors have so far not shared his enthusiasm - Tesla's share price fell after markets opened in the US on Friday morning. The value of its stock was down more than eight percent, trading at around $219, at 11:45 Eastern Time (16:45 BST). Meanwhile shares in ride-hailing rivals Uber and Lyft - which have their own autonomous ambitions - were each trading up to 10% higher. Questions are being asked about Mr Musk's prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time \"before 2027\", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines. \"I tend to be optimistic with time frames,\" he quipped during the event. He said the Cybercab - which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (\u00a323,000). However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is. \"It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,\" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester. \"Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn't seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,\" he added.\n\nMr Musk also said he expected to see \"fully autonomous unsupervised\" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year \"with permission where ever regulators approve it.\" But that approval is far from guaranteed. \"It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,\" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University. Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles. By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles. But the research community \"is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,\" Mr Samaranayake said.\n\nThe cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally been due, external for release in August. This summer, in a post on X , external, formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important. Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.\n\u2022 None Robotaxi tech improves but can they make money? Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened. Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees. Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a \"Robovan\" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time. The sleek shuttle \"could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,\" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.\n\n\"Can you imagine going down the streets and you see this coming towards you? That would be sick,\" Musk told attendees as Tesla's Robovan rolled into Thursday's event.\n\nAnother analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead. \"Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,\" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out. \"Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,\" Caldwell added.\n\nThe deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiary Cruise being suspended in San Francisco after a pedestrian was knocked down. But the sector continues to expand. Waymo said, external in early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology. Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers. It announced, external a multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August.

    "Why weight-loss drugs may be no obesity silver bullet\n\nSir Keir Starmer and his health secretary have been lauding the potential of the new generation of weight-loss drugs. Given as regular injections, the treatments \u2013 Wegovy and Mounjaro \u2013 mimic a hormone that makes people less hungry. Not only could they help reduce waistlines, the prime minister and Wes Streeting said, they could also hold the key to a thriving economy. Sir Keir told the BBC it was time to \u201cthink differently\u201d. He was speaking after it was announced a trial would be run by Health Innovation Manchester, a research group linked to the NHS, and drug firm Eli Lilly to see if the weight loss drug Mounjaro could help get obese people back into work. Obesity is, without doubt, a major burden on the health service and wider economy. Obesity-related illness costs the NHS an estimated \u00a311bn a year \u2013 about 8% of its spending. Add in lost productivity, and research has shown it costs the economy nearly \u00a3100bn a year, external \u2013 or 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of all the economic activity in the country.\n\nSo it is understandable there is huge hope these drugs could be the answer. After all, the search for a solution to expanding waistlines has eluded successive governments since the early 1990s. Promoting healthy lifestyles, improving food labelling, restricting advertising and taking steps to increase the cost of unhealthy foods, such as the sugar tax, have all been tried - but rates of obesity have continued to rise and one in four adults is now obese. Critics say governments have not gone far enough with these initiatives, while pointing out public health spending has been squeezed in the past decade, hampering the ability of healthy lifestyle programmes to have an impact. And despite the undoubted benefits the weight-loss drugs demonstrate, health experts have warned they should not be seen as a quick fix.\n\nFirst, the NHS has tightly restricted their use for weight loss - versions of the drugs are also for diabetes. Wegovy, the brand name for semaglutide, is only available as a weight-loss drug for people who are severely obese and living with other health conditions. And it is only allowed to be given under the supervision of specialist weight loss programmes, access to which is like many NHS services constrained. Mounjaro, meanwhile, is not yet being used by the NHS as a weight-loss treatment - although, the official drugs-advisory body has proposed it should be. The criteria look likely to be similar, with the exception it may be made available more widely in the community, without the need for specialist supervision. And how that can be achieved remains to be seen - as patients still need to follow a structured programme of diet and exercise alongside the treatment. GPs are worried they do not have the capacity to oversee this - and so a range of options are still being explored. And the NHS has warned it could take years for Mounjaro to be rolled out. There is also concern the drugs could encourage a \"dependency culture\", where people do not bother with healthy eating and exercise - something Streeting himself has acknowledged.\n\nSecond, even if the NHS was to expand access, it is not clear drug manufacturers could keep up. Shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic, the version of semaglutide used for diabetes, have been reported by NHS clinics, thought partly due to a boom in demand on the private market, driven by celebrities endorsing their use as the \"skinny jab\". Although Novo Nordisk, which makes the drugs, said there should be plentiful supply of Wegovy as it has established a protected supply for the NHS. And then in terms of the rising numbers of people out of work because of illness, the role of obesity is complex to work out. The numbers not working because of ill health have risen since the pandemic, hitting 2.8 million last year. But data from the Office for National Statistics shows the most common primary factors are mental health problems and musculoskeletal conditions, affecting the joints, bones and muscles. Many will also have weight problems - but tackling that may be only one part of the answer to them returning to work.",
    "Liam Payne's body to be flown back to the UK\n\nLiam Payne died after falling from a hotel balcony in October\n\nThe body of pop star Liam Payne was released to his family on Wednesday to be flown back to the UK, the public prosecutor in charge of his case has confirmed to the BBC. The singer died three weeks ago after falling from a third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina. An autopsy confirmed the 31-year-old had suffered internal and external bleeding and multiple traumatic injuries sustained as a result of the fall. His body had been held in Argentina while local authorities completed further toxicology and laboratory tests. It was released to his family on Wednesday, public prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Madrea told the BBC.\n\nPayne was one of the most recognisable names in pop, after rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s. A co-writer on many of their hits, he also achieved solo success with tracks like Strip That Down and Bedroom Floor. In the week leading up to his death, it was revealed the singer was facing legal action from his ex-fiancee Maya Henry, who had issued a cease and desist order over what she described as \"obsessive\" contact. Payne's girlfriend at the time of his death, Kate Cassidy, said the couple had been planning to get married. The singer's family said they were \"heartbroken\" by his death, adding: \"Liam will forever live in our hearts and we'll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul.\"\n\nIn October, some media outlets reported preliminary toxicology tests, which the Associated Press (AP) news agency said suggested evidence of exposure to cocaine, quoting an unnamed official. But they said the official stressed that the initial results don\u2019t give an accurate idea of how much of the drug was in his blood when he died. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Argentina is continuing to investigate the circumstances around his death.",

    "Seoul says North Korea's plan to deploy troops to fight with Russia is a \"grave security threat\".\n\nNorth Korea has started sending troops to fight with Russia in Ukraine, South Korea's spy agency has said as Seoul warned of a \"grave security threat\". The allegation comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed 10,000 North Korean soldiers could join the war, based on intelligence information. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for a security meeting on Friday and said the international community must respond with \"all available means\". According to the spy agency, 1,500 troops have already arrived in Russia - with anonymous sources telling South Korean media the final figure could be closer to 12,000.\n\nThis comes as evidence mounts that North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, as recently demonstrated by the recovery of a missile in Ukraine\u2019s Poltava region. Moscow and Pyongyang have also been deepening their cooperation in recent months. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin on his birthday, calling him his \"closest comrade\". Friday's security meeting was attended by key officials from South Korea's National Security Office, the Ministry of National Defence, and the National Intelligence Service, Yoon's office said. \"[The participants] decided not to ignore the situation and to jointly respond to it with the international community using all available means,\" it said. The allegation from the National Intelligence Service (NIS) comes days after Ukrainian military intelligence sources said that Russia's army is forming a unit of North Koreans. The BBC has asked the NIS for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukraine's spy chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed that there were nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia to fight in Ukraine. \"They will be ready [to fight in Ukraine] on 1 November,\" Lt Gen Budanov, who heads the Ukrainian Defence Intelligence Directorate, told The Warzone website, external. He added that the North Koreans would be using Russian equipment and ammunition, and the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be sent to Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine holds a number of settlements after launching its incursion in August. Earlier this week, Putin introduced a bill to ratify a military pact he made with Kim, which pledges that Russia and North Korea will help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country. South Korea's spy agency, the NIS, said North Korean troops are training in Russian bases in Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk, and Vlagoveshensk. This appears to confirm information from a military source in Russia\u2019s Far East, who told BBC Russian this week that \u201ca number of North Koreans have arrived\u201d and were stationed in one of the military bases near Ussuriysk. Seoul's spy agency also released aerial photographs of Ussuriysk and Khabarovsk, where they say hundreds of North Korean troops have gathered, and another photo of North Korea's Chongjin port, where a Russian ship was reportedly shown carrying North Korean soldiers. The NIS said it found that since August, North Korea has sent 13,000 shipping containers carrying shells, missiles, and anti-armour rockets to Russia. As many as eight million 122-mm and 152-mm shells have been supplied to Russia, it said. However, some military experts believe the Russian military units will have difficulties incorporating North Korean troops into their frontlines. Apart from the language barrier, the North Korean army has no recent experience of combat operations, they said. \u201cThey could guard some sections of the Russian-Ukrainian border, which would free Russian units for fighting elsewhere,\u201d said Valeriy Ryabykh, editor of the Ukrainian publication Defence Express, external. \u201cI would rule out the possibility that these units will immediately appear on the front line.\u201d Additional reporting by Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee in Seoul",
    "Senators call for probe into Musk's alleged contact with Russia\n\nTwo top Senate Democrats have called for an investigation into Elon Musk's reported contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his top aides. The lawmakers have urged the Pentagon and Justice Department to determine whether Musk's alleged relations with a US adversary while holding major government contracts puts national security at risk. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the world's richest person has had \"multiple, high level conversations\" with Putin since 2022, which the Kremlin has denied. Musk wrote on his X platform on Friday that he's \"going to find out who's making these accusations and nuke them\".\n\nThe two Democrats - Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior Democrat on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees sent a letter, external on Friday to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Defence Department Inspector General Robert Storch raising \"serious questions regarding Mr Musk\u2019s reliability as a government contractor and a [security] clearance holder\". The multi-billionaire claims to hold a top-secret level clearance and his SpaceX company - one of the main contractors to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) - is deeply embedded in the federal government's defence and intelligence infrastructure. \"Russia\u2019s ambitions in the space domain pose a direct threat to US national security,\" the senators wrote. Reed and Shaheen noted that, unlike others with high-level security clearance, Musk does not appear to report his contacts with foreign government officials. They pointed to Musk's alleged communications with Putin's deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko. The Justice Department has said that Kiriyenko and other top officials were involved in an effort to seed Kremlin propaganda on social media, external, including on the Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) platform to reducing international support for Ukraine and influence voters in the US presidential election. Musk, who backed Trump's successful 2024 election bid with millions of dollars, was picked by the president-elect earlier this week to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency. He has also participated in the incoming president's diplomatic efforts. Musk joined Trump's calls over the past week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, as well as a meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at Trump's Florida home. The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported on Friday that Musk recently visited the residence of Iran's United Nations ambassador in New York. It is not clear if Trump or his national security team were aware of the meeting. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran and Iran's foreign minister denied on Saturday that any such meeting had taken place.",

Australian teen: Oh my God, I just talked to the Queen\n\nThousands of people were out on the streets of Sydney on Tuesday, eager to see King Charles and Queen Camilla, set against the iconic Opera House in the late afternoon sunlight. For Buckingham Palace, this was the ideal ending to the royal tour of Australia. The optics were positive. Despite a headline-grabbing protest in Canberra on Monday, the public mood on the ground in Sydney was supportive. But getting to this point - with a successful completion of this trip ahead of a poignant goodbye - will have come as a huge relief to royal aides.\n\nKing Charles met the Indigenous community in Sydney on his Australia visit\n\nBack in February, this tour looked unlikely to happen with the King diagnosed with cancer and having treatment. But it stayed in the diary with modifications on the advice of doctors. The duration of this visit has been shorter and the engagements have been arranged to avoid early starts and late finishes. Even with the alterations, it has still been a busy schedule for the King and Queen. On Tuesday alone the royal couple between them visited a National Centre of Indigenous Excellence, a food bank, a social housing project, a literacy initiative, a community barbecue, meeting two leading cancer researchers, celebrating the Sydney Opera House's 50th anniversary, and a naval review in Sydney Harbour. An Australian arm of the King's Foundation was officially launched, expanding a charity which promotes sustainability and provides training in traditional craft skills. These trips are a quickfire round of very diverse events, with the crowds at each demanding attention - and the King appears to have coped well.\n\nHis health challenges haven\u2019t shown and he has appeared moved by the response he\u2019s had from the public on his first visit here as monarch. The protest at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday was uncomfortable but not unexpected. The King has encountered many protesters over the years and came to Australia knowing that republican sentiment and campaigns in support of Indigenous communities were likely to come up. His presence here in Australia immediately focuses minds on the King's role as head of state and re-opens questions about whether that is right for modern Australia. Although republican sentiment bubbles under the surface here, except for the heckling in Parliament it has not burst through in any significant way on this trip. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who supports a republic, has been at the King and Queen\u2019s side for several engagements and spoken warmly about his royal guests. Before the disruption at Parliament, the prime minister formally welcomed the King to Canberra. \u201cYou have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown. Nothing stands still,\" said Albanese.\n\nCrowds outside the Sydney Opera House held up their phones to capture the visit\n\u2022 None What does King Charles do?",
    "Delivering safe care continues to be a challenge in every emergency department in Scotland, according to a senior A&E doctor. As the service gears up for winter, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) is warning that the government's winter planning is not doing enough to support A&E departments as they approach their busiest time of year. The Scottish government said it is prioritising investment in front-line services. The warning comes after the figure for August's emergency department waiting times was the worst ever recorded for that month, with just under a third of patients waiting longer than four hours to be seen.\n\nThe government target that 95% of patients should be admitted, transferred or discharged from an emergency department within four hours has not been met since summer 2021.\n\nDr John Paul Loughrey is vice president for Scotland of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine\n\nDr John Paul Loughrey, vice president for Scotland of the RCEM, told BBC Scotland News that the Scottish government\u2019s plans for the NHS this winter would not improve the experience of staff or patients. He accused the Scottish government of \"continuing to disregard\" the urgent need to keep patients moving through the hospital system to stop them getting stuck in A&E. \"We are seeing lots of discussion, but we haven\u2019t seen any useful measures so far that will make it any better for people working in A&Es this winter,\" he said. He said there had been no opportunity for A&E departments to \"reset\" over the summer as they would have traditionally, and that it continued to be a very challenging environment - with fears it would get even worse over the winter. Dr Loughrey added that every day recently had been like \"the winter crisis of winters before, but every day\". \"Sometimes giving safe care can be a challenge in every A&E in Scotland,\" he said. He highlighted that one of the big issues in the emergency department was moving patients out of A&E into specialist beds elsewhere in the hospital. This, he said, meant it was difficult to treat new patients arriving at A&E - leading to queues of ambulances outside and patients sometimes left in corridors which he said was \"inhumane\".\n\nDr Loughrey said this \"chronic pressure\" was also leading to burnout for A&E staff, with some choosing to leave emergency medicine. There were failures in the entire system but a lot of the pressure and risk was being heaped on this one area of emergency medicine, he added. \"We can't accept that this is the new normal - we know there are solutions to this problem but they are not easy and not cheap.\" He said there had to be an increase in capacity in acute medicine, and hospital occupancy had to come down. The RCEM carried out a survey of conditions in Scotland\u2019s 21 emergency departments between March and April this year which found that, on average, A&Es were working at 182% capacity. A total of 12.8% of patients were being treated in corridors because of a lack of available space, with 26.1% of patients stuck in the emergency department because there were no beds available to admit patients into hospital for further treatment. The college say there has been \u201cchronic\u201d pressure on A&Es over the last two years that shows no sign of letting up as winter approaches. Its data estimated that hundreds of patients died as a result of long delays, external in an emergency department last year, with Dr Loughrey warning this situation was likely to be repeated again this winter.\n\nAsked about plans to limit winter fuel payments - which was previously paid to all pensioners to help with energy bills, but will now only be made to those who receive certain benefits - Dr Loughrey warned about the impact of deprivation on the most vulnerable in society. He said: \"Every day in A&E [doctors see] people experiencing fuel poverty and food poverty. \"Deprivation is a huge problem and we know that anything that makes life more difficult financially for people will result in unexpected attendances to emergency departments.\" He said patients in the most deprived areas were the biggest users of both primary and emergency care. \"Data was collected in the last two years for the impact on the elderly around about winter and, for example, looking at the number of patients presenting with hypothermia from their own homes. \"We do know that measures that make things more difficult for patients to live a quality life at home will result in more pressures on A&Es.\" He said he worried that this winter could be worse because of some of these factors, and urged the government to address acute capacity issues and also address fuel and food poverty. Dr Loughrey added: \u201cPatients with mental health problems, the frail, the elderly and the vulnerable are the least able to be able to tolerate those ultra long delays in A&E departments\u201d\n\nProf Andrew Elder, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, said: \u201cAs we move closer to another Scottish winter, when pressure on access to and flow through our acute hospital beds will rise substantially, the latest figures on delayed discharges are a source of huge alarm.\u201d The Scottish government said: \u201cWe have moved to year-round surge planning in recognition that surges don\u2019t just occur in winter and can happen at any time of the year. \"Surge planning is now a continual process in which our key partners in statutory services, independent, third and voluntary sectors work collaboratively, including making decisions regarding how funding and resources are deployed. \"We continue to prioritise investment in front-line services in 2024-25 with over \u00a314.2bn investment in our NHS boards with additional funding over half a billion \u2013 an almost 3% real terms uplift.\" Health Secretary Neil Gray told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme he accepted that the current situation in A&Es could \u201cfeel\u201d like a crisis. He said: \"I take the suggestions from any royal college very seriously and I engage directly with them on a weekly basis. \"The situation we're facing in our A&E departments is obviously a challenge - there's no getting away from that. We've got figures demonstrating we are not where we want to be.\" He said increasing numbers of patients were presenting with more complex problems, adding: \"The winter preparedness plan is about trying to alleviate that pressure all year round.\" Responding to Gray's comments, Scottish Conservative MSP Dr Sandesh Gulhane said the cainet secretary was \"stuck in his ministerial ivory tower\" and did not recognise the \"reality\" of what is happening in Scotland\u2019s NHS. \u201cHis stubborn refusal to admit there is a crisis in the health service is completely at odds with what my frontline colleagues are telling him or what suffering patients are experiencing every single day,\" he said. \u201cCritical services are teetering on the brink of collapse yet Neil Gray cannot admit how badly the SNP have mismanaged the health service.\"",
    "\"We are treated like animals in a cage\" says one protest sign put up by the Tamil migrants, who cannot be identified for legal reasons\n\nThe UK has offered dozens of stranded migrants, held for years in a camp on a secretive UK-US military island in the Indian Ocean, a temporary move to Romania. After six months, they could be moved to the UK. Others in the group are being offered financial incentives to go to Sri Lanka where they say they face persecution, the BBC has learned. In 2021, dozens of Tamils became the first people ever to claim asylum on Diego Garcia after their boat ran into trouble. The territory's unusual status led to a long legal dispute, with the UK government saying that bringing them to Britain risked creating a \"backdoor migration route\".\n\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said ministers had been working to find a solution which protects the welfare of migrants and \"the integrity of British territorial borders\". Relocating the most vulnerable migrants while their legal claims are processed would offer them \"greater safety and wellbeing\", the spokesperson said. The offer to the migrants, by British officials on the island on Tuesday, came after the UK announced it was handing sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), which includes Diego Garcia, to Mauritius. The military base, however, will remain on the island. The BBC gained unprecedented access to Diego Garcia last month to attend a court hearing over whether the group had been unlawfully detained in a small fenced camp, which is guarded by private security company G4S. A judgement in the case is expected soon. The British government has argued that the refugee convention is not in force on Biot because it is \"constitutionally distinct\" from the UK, though it is administered from the Foreign Office in London. Instead, the Biot administration established a separate process to determine if the Tamils could be returned to Sri Lanka or be granted international protection - which the UN says is akin to refugee status. There are currently 56 Tamils still on Diego Garcia. A further eight are currently in Rwanda after being transferred there for medical care after self-harm or suicide attempts. Most of the migrants are awaiting decisions on their international protection claims or appealing rejections. In total, eight have been granted international protection.\n\nOver the summer, the top official running the territory, Paul Candler, requested that the government bring all of the migrants to the UK because of what he described as a \"dangerous and unsustainable situation\" in the camp amid mass incidents of self-harm. Mr Candler stepped down a month later, saying in a resignation letter, obtained by the BBC, that he had found the \"migrants situation increasingly difficult\" and \"the personal leadership demands that this has placed on me increasingly challenging\". Speaking to the migrants in the camp on Tuesday morning, Biot\u2019s acting commissioner Nishi Dholakia said the UK government had considered the Biot administration\u2019s earlier request but had decided instead to \"make different offers to different individuals\". \"Some people will receive offers to go to another safe country and others will receive an offer for voluntary return,\" he said. \"I want to reassure you that this announcement does not mean anyone will be leaving the island immediately. You will all have time to consider the offer and next steps.\" Lawyers from the UK firms Leigh Day and Duncan Lewis, representing some of the migrants, said it was \"imperative the camp be closed down without delay\" and that the UK government \"find a viable long term solution for all of the individuals and families\".\n\nMigrants - both on the island and in Rwanda - whose claims for international protection have been approved, as well as families in the camp with children, have been offered a transfer to a \"safe centre\" run by the United Nations in Romania for up to six months. \"Within those six months, the UK will continue to develop a durable solution for you in line with international standards. You can choose to accept any solution presented to you during this time. If you do not wish to accept any offers made during those six months, you will be brought to the UK,\" letters from the Biot administration, seen by the BBC, say. One man, currently in Rwanda, who has been offered the move to Romania described it as \"a very big relief\". Another migrant there said it was the \"happiest day in three years\". Those who have had their protection claims rejected and are not part of family units within the camp have been offered financial incentives to return to Sri Lanka. According to a letter to migrants, seen by the BBC, this will include \u00a33,000, medical insurance for three years, accommodation for up to three years, plus a job or training or education opportunities. The BBC understands that those who have not had their protection claims approved have not yet exhausted all legal avenues. Lawyers representing the migrants are due to fly to Diego Garcia to meet their clients this week. \"I didn't eat anything from the morning. I feel very depressed,\" said one of the Tamils who has been treated for a mental health condition in Rwanda and has now been offered a return to Sri Lanka. The first Tamils who arrived on Diego Garcia in October 2021 said they had been fleeing persecution - and trying to sail to Canada to claim asylum when their boat ran into trouble and they were rescued by the Royal Navy. Their account was backed up by maps, diary entries and GPS data on board. In the following months, more boats arrived.\n\nThe men, women and children are housed in khaki tents, but some have leaks and rats nesting inside\n\nWhen the BBC visited the camp last month, men and women lined up against the six-foot fence and stood outside their tents waving. The camp is made up of beige domed military tents used as accommodation, and white humanitarian tents that have been turned into makeshift communal rooms and a church. Inside one of the tents, where about five or six men sleep, one man lifted a panel above his bed to reveal a nest of rats. \"Look, a leak. A rat hole,\" another said as he pointed urgently around his tent, where sheets and towels were hung to create different rooms. The Tamils have been given green military cots to sleep on but have stacked wooden pallets and flattened cardboard boxes on top in an effort to make them more comfortable.\n\nHand-written signs are hung in the camp with slogans such as \"We are treated like animals in a cage\" and \"This is a bad place\". Some showed off efforts to improve their living situation, including a dining table made of pallets, and plant beds lined with coconut husks. Recently, an internal fence was erected splitting the camp between the single men there and families. An independent social worker hired by one of the migrants\u2019 lawyers described the situation in the camp late last year as an \"emerging mental health pandemic\". Outside the courtroom, men, women and children showed me signs of self-harm. During the court visit to the camp, one woman wept as she alleged that her daughter had been assaulted by another migrant in the tent, one of several claims of sexual assault. Three men, who have each been either charged or convicted of offences within the camp, are being held in a room next to the island\u2019s police station.\n\nPacked on their boat, the Marayan, some of the Tamils intended to voyage to Canada and claim asylum there\n\nBoth United Nations and Red Cross representatives have previously raised concerns about the use of the camp and its conditions. Following a visit late last year, the UN said the camp was \"manifestly not appropriate\" for people to live in long-term and raised particular concerns over reported sexual assaults and harassment of children by other migrants. The chapel used to host the court hearing normally functions as a school. Educational posters were stuck on the walls alongside children's drawings, one of which depicted a military tent with palm trees in the background. A short drive away from the camp, there is accommodation for civilian contractors. Shops, bars, restaurants and leisure facilities, such as a bowling alley and cinema, are available to troops and contractors. The Indian Ocean territory, located hundreds of miles away from any other population, is viewed as an important strategic base for the US. Access to the island is heavily restricted and it has long been shrouded in rumour and mystery. The UK government has confirmed that two US rendition flights landed there in 2002 but says the detainees did not leave the planes.\n\nThe island is under tight security because of the UK-US military base\n\nUK government lawyers earlier this year opposed the BBC being granted access to the island to attend the hearing, but the Biot Supreme Court ruled in the BBC\u2019s favour, saying that \"justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done\". The US - which controls most personnel and resources on Diego Garcia - later said it would block access to the BBC and lawyers representing the migrants. It also said it would withhold food, transport and accommodation from all those attending the hearing, including the British judge. The US and British authorities later allowed the hearing to go ahead, but with restrictions in place. Additional G4S officers were flown over to guard the BBC and lawyers and ensure access around the island was restricted. If they accept Tuesday\u2019s offer, the stranded Tamils could face a 4,600-mile (7,500km) journey to Romania and more time in limbo, or a shorter trip to Sri Lanka. Standing outside the courtroom alongside her parents last month, one 12-year-old girl said that since seeing a military aircraft pass over the camp, she had dreamed of being a pilot - so she too could fly away.",
    "Workers could get right to strike for a year\n\nThe government is considering giving workers twice as long to strike. Under existing legislation, if workers vote to take industrial action, the mandate expires after six months and unions are required to hold another ballot to extend it. But a consultation document produced by the government said the mandate could be extended to a year. It said due to unions being \"very likely'' win a second ballot, keeping the six-month rule would ''add administrative costs'' to them.\n\nRailway staff, train drivers, doctors and teachers are just some of the groups that have staged walk outs in recent times. The walk outs across different sectors and industries over the past couple of years have resulted in more than 5.7 million working days have been lost, the highest number for more than 30 years, according to official figures. Ministers argue that by making it easier for unions to organise, it would lead to a more co-operative relationship with employers and lessen the need for industrial action. The government is proposing to also abolish the requirement that 50% of a workforce turns out to vote. It is looking to get rid of the rule that for \"important public services\" such as the NHS, some 40% of the workforce must have voted in favour of industrial action for it to go ahead. The BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment over the proposals. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, said the government's policies under the Employment Rights Bill were aimed at \"repealing the anti-worker, anti-union laws, and turning the page on industrial relations\". The Employment Rights Bill is a major shake-up of workers' rights, but the reforms proposed are still being worked out and it is still unclear how some will work in practice. Conservative Shadow Business Secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, has urged the government to withdraw the Employment Rights Bill and \"think again\". He said the proposed legislation created \"existential crisis of a magnitude not seen since the pandemic\" for jobs and business people. The government's own analysis released earlier this week said Labour's plans to upgrade workers' rights would cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year to implement.\n\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the union welcomed the government's \"commitment to introduce a modern framework for industrial relations\". Under the bill, the government plans to make to easier for unions to be recognised by employers and companies. A main function of a union is to represent workers in negotiations with their employers over pay and working conditions. At present, 10% of a workforce must be union members for an application to be made to get recognition, but it has been proposed this could be lowered to 2%. Under existing rules, 40% of a workforce must vote in favour of recognition, but under the government's new proposals, that threshold would be abolished. Trade unions have argued that it is too easy for companies to employ extra employees to make it harder for them to reach the required thresholds to be recognised. In July, the GMB trade union lost a vote for recognition at the Amazon Fulfilment Centre in Coventry by 28 votes. The union accused the company of packing out the warehouse with surplus workers in an effort to thwart their bid for recognition. Amazon denied doing so and said it recruited the workers as part of normal business planning.",

    "Water companies have been ordered to return \u00a3158m to customers via lower bills next year after missing key targets on pollution and leaks. But most customers will only see their bills fall by less than \u00a310. This is the fourth year in a row that firms have had to refund customers, prompting questions over the effectiveness of the regulator. Industry body Water UK told the BBC that companies had made improvements across most measures and they were committed to boosting their performance.\n\nOfwat assesses the performance of the 17 largest water and wastewater companies in England and Wales each year against key targets, for issues such as sewer flooding, supply interruptions and water leaks. For the second year in a row, no company achieved the top rating, although four companies did show an improvement from last year. For the worst performing companies, failure to meet the targets means they will now have to collectively return \u00a3157.6m to customers on their bills for 2025-2026. The effectiveness of the fines and Ofwat's ability to regulate the industry has been questioned given companies had under-performed for four years in a row. Defending the regulator, CEO David Black, told the BBC's Today programme: \"It is for water companies and their boards, multi-billion pound enterprises, to turnaround their performance. We agree there is much more to be done and we will continue to work to drive the sector to perform better.\" Thames Water will have to make the largest repayment to customers of \u00a356.8m, although its overall performance improved from last year. Despite the record fine most customers will see their bills fall by only a few pounds. Any reduction will be dwarfed by the expected long-term increase of \u00a394 per household over the next five years, which Ofwat is currently proposing. This price rise is still being negotiated with water companies as part of their investment plans. The companies argue that even higher bills will be needed if they are to afford the infrastructure improvements required to tackle some of the issues raised in this performance report.\n\nOfwat's review looked at key targets including reducing pollution incidents, which were meant to fall by 30% between 2020 and 2025. Companies had achieved a 15% reduction over the last few years. But that improvement has been almost wiped out by the significantly higher number of incidents last year. The industry has said that although this performance was unacceptable, the record levels were due to heavy rain and more sites now being monitored. But Ofwat's David Black said: \u201cIt is clear that companies need to change and that has to start with addressing issues of culture and leadership. Too often we hear that weather, third parties or external factors are blamed for shortcomings.\u201d Public dissatisfaction with the industry has risen in recent years particularly in relation to pollution. CEO of campaign group River Action James Wallace said: \"This might sound like a lot of money but frankly it is a drop in the ocean for polluting water companies.\" Mr Wallace questioned whether Ofwat was an effective regulator, \"The new Government is taking some positive steps, including a review of the water sector and the introduction of a Water Bill. However, we believe the bill, as currently drafted, falls short. Where is the duty on Ofwat to prioritise the environment and penalise pollution?\" he said.\n\nDavid Henderson, chief executive of Water UK, told the BBC's Today Programme: \"Performance is clearly not where it should be, and companies are fully committed to boosting that performance. \"It is important to note though that it is not all bad, across every single measure all but two, water companies have delivered improvements since the start of the decade - leakage is at is lowest level in history.\" Ofwat estimates that currently about a fifth of all water put into the network in England and Wales is lost via leaks. This is an important area for the industry to tackle because many areas of England already regularly experience water shortages and climate change is expected to exacerbate this issue. The Environment Agency estimates, external that the country will need an additional 5 billion litres of water a day by 2050 to support the economy and environment. Some companies were praised in the report for their efforts to tackle this and other issues, including Severn Trent, which Ofwat said had managed to cut sewage spills by delivering improvements at 467 sites. Severn Trent, SES Water, Northumbrian Water, and United Utilities exceeded their targets and therefore will be able to charge customers more next year, as part of a scheme to incentivise the industry. Following the release of the report, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the environment secretary would be writing to the Chairs and CEOs of every water company laying out the performance improvements that he expects them to make in the coming year.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "Lily Ebert, who was sent to Auschwitz during World War Two, died on Wednesday\n\nA 100-year-old Holocaust survivor, whose story became famous as she searched for the family of a soldier who saved her, has died. Hungarian-born Lily Ebert, who lived in north-west London, was taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944 with her family when she was 20. Her story went viral four years ago when she tried to find out more about the American soldier who liberated her from a death march in Germany. The King is among those who paid tribute to Ms Ebert, praising her \"extraordinary resilience and courage\".\n\nMs Ebert had been determined to reach as many people to share her experiences, which led her to embrace social media. King Charles wrote: \"As a survivor of the unmentionable horrors of the Holocaust, I am so proud that she later found a home in Britain where she continued to tell the world of the horrendous atrocities she had witnessed, as a permanent reminder of the depths of depravity and evil to which humankind can fall, when reason, compassion and truth are abandoned.\" She answered questions and explained the ordeal to younger generation, and with the help of her great-grandson, Dov, she gained two million followers on TikTok.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

    "How my investigation led to sex trafficking charges against ex-Abercrombie boss\n\nBarrett Pall showing a diary entry about his experience to BBC correspondent Rianna Croxford\n\nIn a federal courtroom in New York, for the first time I\u2019m face to face with Mike Jeffries \u2013 the multi-millionaire ex-fashion boss I\u2019ve spent three years investigating for the BBC. He stares at me directly, lips pursed, and chin raised, as he sits before the judge. As a result of my reporting, he was arrested this week by the FBI and charged with running an international sex trafficking and prostitution business along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman James Jacobson. Authorities acted after hearing my podcast series, The Abercrombie Guys, in which I unearthed evidence that Mr Jeffries, 80, and Mr Smith, 61, had been at the centre of a sophisticated global operation involving a network of recruiters and a middleman scouting young men for sex. As CEO of teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, Mike Jeffries was described to me as an eccentric and superstitious genius who, with his highlighted hair and penchant for flip-flops and plastic surgery, personified the youthful All-American brand he created. But now, his hair white, his fillers dissolved, and wearing an ankle monitor \u2013 he seemed a shadow of the mogul said to have used his power and strength while in charge to abuse vulnerable models. US prosecutors say he and the others accused used force, fraud and coercion to make men engage in violent and exploitative sex acts from at least 2008-2015. If convicted, they face a maximum of life in prison. Shoulders slouched, Mr Jeffries\u2019 face was blank as his lawyer entered his plea of not guilty. His life partner Matthew Smith - a UK citizen - is yet to appear in court. He\u2019s considered a flight risk by authorities and is currently detained until trial.\n\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of sexual acts\n\nMr Jeffries, pictured here, and his partner have previously denied wrongdoing\n\nWhen I think back to how my own investigation began, in January 2021, I never imagined it would lead to this moment. During the pandemic, I was researching the fashion industry when I stumbled across a cryptic Instagram comment written by a former model named Barrett Pall. He was part of a group discussing how they felt abuse against male models was being ignored. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it happen with #MeToo, how about #UsToo?\u201d one wrote. We soon got on the phone. After an hour of talking, he said he felt he could trust with me a secret he\u2019d never really shared before. \u201cIt\u2019s probably like the darkest experience I\u2019ve ever dealt with,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey had someone come and shave me, like my whole body, because that\u2019s how they like the boys.\u201d In 2011, then aged 22, Barrett said he\u2019d been referred by an older model, who was a close friend, to meet a mysterious middleman he described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. He said this man - who I later identified through phone and property records as James Jacobson - had made him perform a sex act as a \u201ctryout\u201d before sending him to Mike Jeffries, then CEO and chairman of Abercrombie & Fitch, and his British partner. Barrett claimed that, for years, the duo had been throwing elaborate sex events at their palatial home in the Hamptons. He said the one he had attended was facilitated by chaperones in Abercrombie polos and flip-flops, carrying silver platters of alcohol, poppers and lube.\n\nBarrett Pall, a former model turned life coach and activist, said he felt pressured into attending an event in the Hamptons in 2011\n\nWhat Barrett told me sparked my initial two-year investigation. I travelled across America, from the suburbs of Ohio to the desert of Palm Springs, tracking down men affected and confronting those involved \u2013 including the middleman himself. Usually when I\u2019m investigating, I can find a few loose threads to pull at by searching newspaper archives, court records or social media. But there was absolutely nothing in the public domain about these allegations. So I took an old-school approach, piecing together my own trail through word of mouth, knocking on doors, and sending handwritten letters to potential sources. I traced and contacted hundreds of people including former Abercrombie & Fitch models and Mr Jeffries\u2019 ex-household staff, earning trust over months. Barrett Pall had an old iPad that wouldn\u2019t turn on - but we got it fixed. Through that, I obtained an itinerary and flight ticket corroborating the event he attended in the Hamptons. It was sent by the middleman James Jacobson and contained some first names and numbers of others involved. I later recovered more than a dozen of these itineraries from different sources, finally giving me concrete leads. But it took me months to figure out their roles, not wanting to tip the wrong person off while I was still in evidence-gathering mode. Many men were wary of speaking. Two accused me of being a \u201cspy\u201d for Mike Jeffries \u2013 initially fearful of his \u201cmoney and clout\u201d. I, too, became increasingly paranoid after I began facing hundreds of hacking attempts each day from unknown IP addresses.\n\nThe BBC found regular sex events were held at Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith's home on New York's Long Island\n\nWe were right to be cautious. In their indictment, unsealed on Tuesday, prosecutors said Mike Jeffries had employed a full-service security company to oversee non-disclosure agreements (NDA), conduct background checks, and surveil and intimidate anyone who threatened to expose them. I have since spoken with more than 20 men who attended or helped organise these events for Mr Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith. Some like Luke, an aspiring model who told me he was recruited under the guise of attending an A&F photoshoot, said they had been misled and not told sex was involved. How did this operation stay hidden for so long? The answer I reached was that the shame some men felt talking about same-sex abuse had silenced them as effectively as any NDA. Some told me they had felt suicidal, others completely broken. In many instances, I was the first person they had confided in. One man, who I\u2019m calling Alex, broke down as he told me he believed he was drugged and raped by an unknown assailant at an opulent event hosted in Marrakesh for which dozens of men had been flown in. He believed this led to him contracting HIV. \u201cJeffries was the kingpin,\u201d he told me at the time. \u201cWithout him none of this could have happened.\u201d\n\nMr Jeffries' partner Matthew Smith has rarely been photographed, but the BBC obtained images of him from the 1990s\n\nAhead of publication, I worked with BBC Panorama to meticulously fact-check my evidence. This involved speaking with those inside the operation - including James Jacobson. When podcast producer Ruth Evans and I knocked on his door one sweltering day in rural Wisconsin in August 2023, he sank onto his steps, put his head in his hands and swore. He asked me for a deal. \u201cLeave my name out and I\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d he said. Mr Jacobson repeated this request dozens of times the following day, when he agreed to meet for coffee. We spoke for two hours. At times it was bizarre - he admired my shorthand, commented on my British accent and seemed to patronise me - calling me \u201csweetheart\u201d. He\u2019s a former actor and at one point put on a bunch of accents, and pretended to wear a cloak, trying to convince me he could do an anonymous interview. But he was charismatic too, and joked about his missing nose, saying the only job he could get these days was as a Bond villain. Eventually, Mr Jacobson said he was just \u201cdoing his job\u201d and hadn\u2019t spoken to Mr Jeffries or Mr Smith since 2015. Ultimately, he didn\u2019t get his deal, and in court, he again sat with his head in his hands as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty.\n\nJames Jacobson worked as a middleman for Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith, scouting young men for sex events\n\nAfter we published in October 2023, some of the men in this story took legal action against Mike Jeffries, Matthew Smith and Abercrombie & Fitch, who they are suing for rape, assault and sex trafficking. All deny wrongdoing. The lawsuit claims it\u2019s likely that more than 100 men were abused during Mr Jeffries' tenure. Sources also began contacting me to say they had been approached by law enforcement. We were not involved in the FBI\u2019s investigation - which was totally independent of mine. Protecting sources is integral to my work. So, it would be the men\u2019s decision to talk. Looking back, there were moments I considered giving up. I initially faced dead end after dead end. But the more I heard, the more I felt a duty to bring this to light for the first time and hold those involved to account. More than two years on from our first conversation, I asked Barrett Pall why he decided to speak to me. He started crying and said: \u201cMy gut said trust her. Tell her your story. And maybe, just maybe, someone will listen.\u201d Announcing the charges, US attorney Breon Peace said: \u201cTo anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using the so-called 'casting couch' system, this case should serve as a warning. Prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison.\u201d\n\nBBC correspondent Rianna Croxford near Mr Jeffries' home in the Hamptons\n\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?",
    "Israel's row with UN over Lebanon peacekeepers driven by long distrust\n\nUnifil has been operating along the Israel-Lebanon boundary since 1978\n\nTensions between Israel and the UN over its peacekeeping operations in southern Lebanon have escalated in recent days \u2013 although the confrontations have their roots in years of mistrust and recriminations. In the latest standoff, the head of UN peacekeeping operations rejected a call on Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the forces known as Unifil to pull out of \u201ccombat areas\u201d. The UN force was established in 1978 after the Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon, and had its role bolstered in 2006 to monitor and keep the peace there after that year\u2019s war between Israel and Hezbollah. I\u2019ve filmed with UN peacekeepers patrolling the 120 km (75-mile) \u201cBlue Line\u201d \u2013 the UN-recognised boundary that separates Israel and Lebanon - and have seen the dangerous work of demining 5 million square metres of land in southern Lebanon, where Unifil has destroyed more than 51,000 mines and unexploded bombs left over after previous wars. But Israel accuses Unifil of falling woefully short in one of its other key responsibilities. Under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war, the UN was meant to create an area in southern Lebanon free of armed forces other than those of the Lebanese army. \u201cThe UN is a failed organization and Unifil is a useless force that failed to enforce Resolution 1701, failed to prevent Hezbollah from establishing itself in southern Lebanon,\" said Israeli cabinet minister Eli Cohen in a recent social media post. Israel accuses Unifil of having turned a blind eye to Hezbollah\u2019s extensive regrouping and rearming, as the Iranian-backed Shia organisation grew into a formidable fighting force \u2013 even bigger than the official Lebanese army. Hezbollah is now proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. According to the pro-Israel pressure group, UN Watch, Unifil \u201cdid nothing\u201d as \u201cHezbollah was digging tunnels to invade Israel, kidnap & attack Israeli civilians\u2026 and embedding missiles in civilian homes.\u201d UN Watch and the Israeli Government\u2019s Media office have published several posts in recent days alleging that Hezbollah had been able to operate freely and within clear sight of UN bases and posts along or near the Blue Line. Tunnels, heavy weaponry and equipment in preparation for attack on Israel have all been discovered after Israeli troops crossed the border into Lebanon. That, said a belligerent Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video message addressed directly to the UN secretary general this week is why Israel is demanding that Unifil forces withdraw from conflict areas in southern Lebanon. The Israeli prime minister urged Antonio Guterres not to allow Hezbollah to use UN peacekeepers as \u201chuman shields\u201d and said the secretary general\u2019s refusal to evacuate the Unifil soldiers makes them \"hostages of Hezbollah... endangering them and the lives of our [Israeli] soldiers\".\n\nIsrael was widely criticised after five Unifil peacekeepers were injured following the ground invasion on 1 October. In several incidents Israeli fire has hit clearly marked and unmistakable Unifil bases, and in one case Israeli tanks forced their way into a Unifil compound where they initially refused demands to leave. Israel has offered explanations for those incidents but, again, says the way to avoid a repetition is for Unifil troops to withdraw from the area. That has been met with a firm \u201cNo\u201d. A Unifil spokesperson accused the Israeli military of \u201cdeliberately\u201d firing on its positions and 40 of the nations that contribute troops to Unifil said last week that they \u201cstrongly condemn recent attacks\u201d on the peacekeepers. The UN Security Council, meeting in New York, also \u201curged all parties to respect the safety and security of Unifil personnel and UN premises,\u201d said Switzerland\u2019s UN Ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl. She added: \u201cThey reiterated their support to Unifil, underscoring its role in supporting regional stability.\u201d\n\nIsrael says Hezbollah is using Unifil as cover\n\nThere are UN bodies also trying to hold Israel to account in Gaza, where for the last week Israeli troops have been involved in an enhanced offensive to drive remaining Hamas fighters from northern areas, including the Jabalia refugee camp. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say that they have issued clear orders for thousands of civilians to leave the conflict zone for so-called \u201csafe areas\u201d. But with as many as 400,000 people trapped in the north, few areas in Gaza can be considered \u201csafe\u201d and, according to many reports, more than 300 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s latest offensive. That led the UN Human Rights Office to issue a strongly worded statement saying that the IDF was \u201ctrapping tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians, in their homes and shelters with no access to food or other life-sustaining necessities\u201d. The statement also accused Israel of cutting off the area completely from the rest of Gaza and said that Israeli troops have fired on civilians trying to flee the area which could amount to a \u201cwar crime\u201d. Israel says it is sending more food and medical supplies into northern Gaza and that Hamas is actively encouraging, even preventing, civilians from leaving Jabalia. For many in the current Israeli administration, the bottom line is that \u2013 for many years \u2013 the UN and its organisations have been inherently and structurally anti-Israel. Israel has long-accused Unrwa \u2013 the UN body established more than 70 years ago to support Palestine refugees across the Middle East, including Gaza and the West Bank - of actively acting against its interests. Israel has long-accused Unrwa \u2013 the UN body established more than 70 years ago to support Palestine refugees across the Middle East, including Gaza and the West Bank \u2013 of actively acting against its interests. It says Unrwa personnel were directly involved in Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks, when thousands of gunmen broke through the border fence from Gaza and killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took another 251 back to Gaza as hostages.\n\nIsrael has accused Unrwa members of being involved in the 7 October attacks\n\nThe number of Unrwa personnel accused of participating in the attacks was 12, out of a 13,000-strong workforce. Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told the Security Council that Unrwa had allowed Hamas to infiltrate its ranks and that \u201cthis infiltration is so ingrained, so institutional, that the organization is simply beyond repair\u201d. To that end, a committee in Israel\u2019s parliament has now approved legislation that would ban Unrwa from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the Israeli government and the agency. Unrwa's head responded, saying that if the legislation is adopted, the body\u2019s humanitarian operations in Gaza and the West Bank may \u201cdisintegrate\u201d. Philippe Lazzarini said that senior Israeli officials were \u201cbent on destroying Unrwa\u201d which is the main provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza. It runs schools, primary healthcare centres and social services for the vast majority of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.2 million people. But criticisms from the UN and its member nations will not deter Israel from achieving its military objectives in Gaza and Lebanon, nor in the occupied West Bank as long, crucially, as it enjoys the backing of the United States. Remarkably, Israel has gone as far as barring the UN secretary general from entering the country. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Antonio Guterres was now persona non-grata after not \"unequivocally\" condemning Iran's missile attack on Israel. The move prompted Mr Guterres to insist that he \u201cstrongly condemn[ed]\u201d the attack, although the \"ban\" has not been lifted. While Israel might owe its very existence to the UN \u2013 the body that voted it into being in 1947 \u2013 its relationship with the organisation has never been so bad.",
    "'They're like my kids' - how team harmony is fuelling GB's BJK Cup run\n\nKatie Boulter (left) replaced Emma Raducanu as the British women's number one in 2023\n\nCoverage: Watch live on BBC Red Button, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website & app; follow live text commentary on the website and app; listen to BBC Radio 5 Live for updates\n\nWhen Emma Raducanu was discovering life as a full-time player on the WTA Tour in 2022, she described herself as a \"loner\". It raised questions about whether integrating the 2021 US Open champion into the Great Britain team environment might prove difficult. In a sport where players operate as sole traders for the majority of the year, switching from a mindset of pursuing individual glory to achieving a common goal can be tricky. But the way that British captain Anne Keothavong has managed to forge a bond between her players - particularly leading pair Raducanu and Katie Boulter - has been the key to the nation's run to the Billie Jean King Cup semi-finals. On Tuesday, Britain face Slovakia as they look to reach the final of the women's team event for the first time since 1981. \"I know what's important for me in this competition, that the girls find a way to gel and get on,\" said Keothavong. \"I know from my previous experience as a player, that wasn't always the case.\"\n\nInstilling a strong camaraderie, and seeing her group thriving as a result, is a source of great satisfaction for Keothavong. It comes from a personal place. Keothavong's voice wavered with emotion as she recalled her relationship with former British team-mate Elena Baltacha, who died of cancer aged 30 in 2014. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the pair competed for the status of British number one and for a long time did not see eye-to-eye. \"I don't think it's any secret we had our ups and downs, but towards the end we were pretty tight,\" said Keothavong. \"We were able as adults, because we were a bit older and more mature, to reflect on how we could have been better. \"When she passed away, you just think all of that was such a waste. To spend so much time being angry with each other was totally unnecessary.\"\n\u2022 None 'We're in it to win it' - Boulter & Raducanu put GB into BJK Cup semis\n\nThe mood in the British camp has been far from tense during their time in Malaga. When they could not leave their hotel on Wednesday because of heavy rain and flash flooding in the Andalusian city, spirits were kept high with games of spikeball and a yoga session. The group also celebrated Raducanu's 22nd birthday together. Balloons and banners were hung outside her bedroom door in the morning, followed by the presentation of a candlelit chocolate cake in the evening. The camaraderie has also been strengthened with what Raducanu describes as a \"few inside jokes\" running through the camp. \"I don't think there is any pressure. We're just enjoying ourselves,\" said Boulter. \"I know they've got my back, so no matter what happens, I'm just going to go out and do my best. I know they'll support me.\" While Raducanu and Boulter have been leading from the front, Keothavong stresses her team is more than just a double act. Harriet Dart, Heather Watson and Olivia Nicholls all put points on the board in Britain's run to the 2022 semi-finals and, although they have not yet been called upon in Malaga, have already played key roles. Watson is described as the \"life and soul\" of the group, with Nicholls also behind a lot of the \"banter\". \"Sometimes it's like when I leave my children at home, what are they up to today? It's like picking up extra kids,\" said Keothavong.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFrivolity only gets a team so far, though. Having a Grand Slam champion like Raducanu ready to work in tandem with Boulter, a top 25 player, has been a difference-maker. Raducanu led Britain into the 12-nation knockout stage by winning both her matches in April's qualifier against France, Boulter providing the other point with one victory. In Malaga, neither has dropped a set in the best-of-three wins over Germany and Canada. \"The more I play Billie Jean King Cup, the more I enjoy it, the more I feel like the stakes are so high - but in a really relaxed and exciting way,\" said Raducanu, who had not played for two months because of a foot injury before this event. Against Slovakia, Raducanu and Boulter will again face lower-ranked opponents, meaning Britain are favourites to set up a final against Italy on Wednesday. Even if they lose, it has been a credible run given they were the second lowest-ranked team and the uncertainty over Raducanu's fitness. \"Being able to captain this team is a huge privilege for me,\" said Keothavong. \"But the job is far from over.\"",
    "No, Hurricane Milton was not 'engineered'\n\nFalse claims suggesting that Hurricane Milton was \u201cengineered\u201d and that the weather in Florida is being \u201cmanipulated\u201d have been spreading on social media. There is no technology that allows humans to create and control hurricanes. But on platforms like X and TikTok, posts alleging - without evidence - that the US government is secretly controlling the weather have been viewed millions of times. Many were published by accounts known for spreading conspiracy theories, as well as misinformation about Covid-19 or vaccines. On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden described the claims, external as \"beyond ridiculous\", adding \"it's so stupid, it's got to stop\".\n\nHe was responding to Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who in recent days suggested on her social media accounts that the US government \"can control the weather\". Posts seen by BBC Verify mainly suggest Hurricane Milton, one of the strongest storms in recent US history, was purposefully created by shadowy forces at the heart of US politics. But the accounts making that claim proposed several different explanations for how that was supposedly done.\n\nSome users alleged weather manipulation techniques like cloud seeding are to blame. Cloud seeding involves manipulating existing clouds to try to produce more rain, for example in countries with a dry climate. But the south-east of the US had already been hit by huge amounts of rainfall from Hurricane Helene, which triggered deadly flooding in several states just two weeks ago. \u201cWhen we cloud seed, it is because we do not have enough aerosols or water vapor within the atmosphere to see condensation occur, so we try and force it through cloud seeding,\u201d says Jill Trepanier, an expert in extreme weather phenomena from Louisiana State University. \u201cOver the western Gulf of Mexico and the Bay of Campeche, that is not a problem. The Earth will make a hurricane all on its own.\u201d Other users blamed \u201cgeoengineering\u201d instead - a wide array of methods to manipulate the environment with a view to reducing the effects of climate change.\n\nBut there are no tools that would allow humans to create or control storms like this one. \u201cThere is no possibility using current knowledge and technology to use geoengineering to modify hurricanes,\u201d says Suzana Camargo from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Typically they begin as what is known as a tropical wave - a low pressure area where thunderstorms and clouds develop. As strong winds push this system away from Africa and towards the Americas, warm, moist air rises from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and the system of clouds and winds begins to spin.\n\nWith sufficient energy from the warm ocean waters, combined with favourable circulation patterns in the atmosphere, it may be able to strengthen into a full hurricane. Social media posts seen by BBC Verify wrongly suggest hurricanes like this one are being created for sinister reasons, including to attempt to sway next month\u2019s presidential election. Those assertions are false, but there is a link to human activity because of the way climate change is making these storms generally more intense.\n\nClimate change - caused by emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide from human activities - is not thought to be increasing the number of tropical storms worldwide. But rising temperatures do make the strongest hurricanes more likely. Warmer seas mean that these storms can pick up more energy, potentially leading to higher wind speeds. Hurricane Milton strengthened particularly quickly as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico, where sea surface temperatures were around 1-2C warmer than average. Peak sustained wind speeds increased from 90mph (150km/h), external to 175mph (280km/h), external in just 12 hours on 7 October, according to National Hurricane Center data. For some social media users, this sudden change was perceived as \u201cevidence\u201d to back their suggestions this was not a \u201cnatural\u201d storm, but instead one manufactured by humans.\n\nBut this trend fits with expectations of hurricanes generally intensifying more quickly in a warming world. \u201cAs we warm the planet, we anticipate a lot of potential impacts to hurricanes that can make them more damaging - including the ability to strengthen more quickly over unnaturally warm ocean waters,\u201d explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. Hurricane Helene \u2013 which hit Florida around two weeks ago \u2013 also intensified rapidly over the Gulf of Mexico. A new study released on Wednesday found that the exceptionally high sea surface temperatures over its track were made hundreds of times more likely by human-caused warming. \u201c[Helene] was significantly more destructive because of climate change,\u201d explains Ben Clarke of the World Weather Attribution group, which led the study. Beyond typically stronger winds, climate change is also affecting other hurricane hazards. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture - up to about 7% for every 1C of temperature rise. This means that rainfall can be more intense. And global sea-levels have been rising in recent decades, largely thanks to global warming. This makes it more likely that a given storm surge - short-term increases to sea-levels from storms - will lead to coastal flooding. In Florida, average sea-levels have risen by more than 18cm (7in) since 1970, external, according to US government data. For some of the users spreading conspiracy theories around Hurricane Milton, this too amounts to \u201cscaremongering\u201d. But the evidence suggests otherwise.",
    "Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for war\n\nPalestinians and aid groups suspect Israel is gradually adopting a new tactic in northern Gaza\n\nOn Saturday morning, a message was posted on social media by the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic spokesman warning people living in the \u2018D5\u2019 area of northern Gaza to move south. D5 is a square on the grid superimposed over maps of Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is a block that is split into several dozen smaller areas. The message, external, the latest in a series, said: \"The IDF is operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time. The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area.\" A map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route. The message is not promising a swift return to the places people have been living in, an area that has been pulverised by a year of repeated Israeli attacks. The heart of the message is that the IDF will be using \"great force\u2026 for a long time\". In other words, don\u2019t expect to come back any time soon. The humanitarian area designated by Israel in the message is al-Mawasi, previously an agricultural area on the coast near Rafah. It is overcrowded and no safer than many other parts of Gaza. BBC Verify has tracked at least 18 airstrikes on the area. Hamas has sent out its own messages to the 400,000 people left in northern Gaza, an area that was once the urban heartland of the Strip with a population of 1.4m. Hamas is telling them not to move. The south, they are told, is just as dangerous. As well as that, Hamas is warning them that they will not be allowed back. Many people appear to be staying put, despite Israeli airstrikes and artillery bombardments. When I went down to an area overlooking northern Gaza I could hear explosions and see columns of smoke rising. The intensity reminded me of the first months of the war.\n\nSome of the people who have stayed in northern Gaza when so many others have already fled south are doing so to remain with vulnerable relatives. Others are from families with connections to Hamas. Under the laws of war, that does not automatically make them belligerents. One tactic that has been used over the last year by civilians who want to avoid IDF operations without taking their chances in the overcrowded and dangerous south of Gaza is to move elsewhere in the north, for example from Beit Hanoun to Gaza City, while the IDF is operating near their homes or shelters. When the army moves on, they return. The IDF is trying to stop that happening, according to BBC colleagues who are in daily contact with Palestinians in Gaza. It is channelling families who are moving in one direction only, down Salah al-Din, the main road to the south. Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza to report the war, except for brief, rare and closely supervised trips with the IDF. Palestinian journalists who were there on 7 October still do brave work. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 128 Palestinian media workers in Gaza have been killed since the war began. In northern Gaza, since Israel went back on the offensive, they have been filming panic-stricken families as they flee, often with small children helping out by carrying oversized backpacks.\n\nSome Palestinians began moving south after the IDF order to leave area D5 on its map of Gaza\n\nOne of them sent out a brief interview with a woman called Manar al-Bayar who was rushing down the street carrying a toddler. She was saying as she half-walked, half-ran on the way out of Jabalia refugee camp that \"they told us we had five minutes to leave the Fallujah school. Where do we go? In southern Gaza there are assassinations. In western Gaza they\u2019re shelling people. Where do we go, oh God? God is our only chance.\u201d The journey is hard. Sometimes, Palestinians in Gaza say, people on the move are fired on by the IDF. It insists that Israeli soldiers observe strict rules of engagement that respect international humanitarian law. But Medical Aid for Palestinians\u2019 head of protection, Liz Allcock, says the evidence presented by wounded civilians suggest that they have been targeted. \u201cWhen we\u2019re receiving patients in hospitals, a large number of those women and children and people of, if you like, non-combatant age are receiving direct shots to the head, to the spine, to the limbs, very indicative of the direct targeted attack.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the UN and aid agencies who work in Gaza are saying that Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe. Desperate messages are being relayed from the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, saying that they are running low on fuel to power the generators that keep the hospitals going, and keep badly wounded patients alive. Some hospitals report that their buildings have been attacked by the Israelis.\n\nAftermath of an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Jabalia last month. The UN and aid agencies say Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe\n\nThe suspicion among Palestinians, the UN and relief agencies is that the IDF is gradually adopting some or all of a new tactic to clear northern Gaza known as the \"Generals\u2019 Plan\". It was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by Maj-Gen (ret) Giora Eiland, who is a former national security adviser. Like most Israelis they are frustrated and angry that a year into the war Israel still has not achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The Generals\u2019 Plan is a new idea that its instigators believe can, from Israel\u2019s perspective, break the deadlock. At its heart is the idea that Israel can force the surrender of Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar by increasing the pressure on the entire population of the north. The first step is to order civilians to leave along evacuation corridors that will take them south of Wadi Gaza, an east-west stream that has become a dividing line in Gaza since the Israeli invasion last October. Giora Eiland believes Israel should have done a deal straight away to get the hostages back, even if it meant pulling out of Gaza entirely. A year later, other methods, he says, are necessary. In his office in central Israel, he laid out the heart of the plan.\n\n\u201cSince we already encircled the northern part of Gaza in the past nine or 10 months, what we should do is the following thing to tell all the 300,000 residents [that the UN estimates is 400,000] who still live in the northern part of Gaza that they have to leave this area and they should be given 10 days to leave through safe corridors that Israel will provide. \"And after that time, all this area will become to be a military zone. And all the Hamas people will still, though, whether some of them are fighters, some of them are civilians\u2026 will have two choices either to surrender or to starve.\" Eiland wants Israel to seal the areas once the evacuation corridors are closed. Anyone left behind would be treated as an enemy combatant. The area would be under siege, with the army blocking all supplies of food, water or other necessities of life from going in. He believes the pressure would become unbearable and what is left of Hamas would rapidly crumble, freeing the surviving hostages and giving Israel the victory it craves. The UN World Food Programme says that the current offensive in Gaza is having a \"disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families\". The main crossings into northern Gaza, it says, have been closed and no food aid has entered the strip since 1 October. Mobile kitchens and bakeries have been forced to stop work because of air strikes. The only functioning bakery in the north, which is supported by WFP, caught fire after it was hit by an explosive munition. The position in the south is almost as dire. It is not clear whether the IDF has adopted the Generals' Plan in part or in full, but the circumstantial evidence of what is being done in Gaza suggests it is at the very least a strong influence on the tactics being used against the population. The BBC submitted a list of questions to the IDF, which were not answered. The ultra-nationalist extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet want to replace Palestinians in northern Gaza with Jewish settlers. Among many statements he\u2019s made on the subject, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said \u201cOur heroic fighters and soldiers are destroying the evil of Hamas, and we will occupy the Gaza Strip\u2026 to tell the truth, where there is no settlement, there is no security.\u201d",
    "A depiction of the late Queen Elizabeth II was among the works taken\n\nTwo artworks by the American artist Andy Warhol have been stolen during an overnight break-in at a gallery in the Netherlands. The incident took place at the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province. The thieves originally took four silkscreens from Warhol's Reigning Queens series but abandoned two nearby, the gallery owner told Dutch broadcaster NOS. The works taken are of the late Queen Elizabeth II and of Margrethe II, who was Queen of Denmark until her abdication earlier this year.\n\nLocal police, who are investigating, said it appeared that there had been some form of explosion and that there was a lot of damage to the gallery and surrounding buildings. The thieves are said to have fled in a car. According to NOS, two other prints in the series, depicting Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Queen Ntombi Tfwala of Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, were abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle. The four artworks were being kept at the gallery ahead of the PAN Amsterdam art fair later this month, where they were to be put up for sale as a set. They are part of a series of 16 silk screens of the four queens that Warhol, who is considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created in 1985 - two years before his death.",
    "Far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been taken into custody ahead of a major demonstration by his supporters in London this weekend. Kent Police said a 41-year-old man had been arrested at the direction of the High Court and would appear at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday in connection with contempt of court allegations. The force said Tommy Robinson has also been charged under his real name of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon with allegedly refusing to provide his phone\u2019s PIN to officers who had stopped and questioned him at the border in Folkestone in July. He was granted bail over that allegation and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 13 November. The alleged offence under the Terrorism Act is not an accusation that he was planning an attack and relates solely to police powers to examine phones at ports as part of investigations.\n\nMr Yaxley-Lennon is facing potential jail at Monday's hearing on contempt of court charges. It is alleged he breached an injunction not to repeat lies about a Syrian refugee which had been previously ruled by a judge to be defamatory. Shortly after he entered Folkestone police station on Friday afternoon, the official Tommy Robinson X account confirmed that he had been taken into custody.\n\nThe move to detain Mr Yaxley-Lennon comes less than 24 hours before a major policing operation to contain potentially thousands of his supporters. For weeks, and posting from abroad, he had been urging them to come to London on Saturday, claiming that the state was trying to silence him for speaking out about the impact of immigrants on the UK. Metropolitan Police commanders have put in place a significant operation to contain the protest and separate it from a counter-demonstration. Both the Met and British Transport Police are due to be supported by officers from other forces across the country. The Met said there would be a \"significant police presence\" to ensure the two groups were kept apart. It is not clear how many people will attend but a similar gathering in London in July saw thousands of Robinson supporters in Trafalgar Square. The activist, who founded the now-defunct English Defence League, has been accused by critics of whipping up tensions during the summer\u2019s riots. Mr Yaxley-Lennon has not been charged with any offences relating to the disturbances.",

    "Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has plunged from the top of the North American box office, suffering a massive 80% drop from last weekend\u2019s chart-topping debut of $40m (\u00a330.65m) to just $7.1m. That is a record collapse for a comic-book film, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It was knocked off its perch by indie horror film Terrifier 3, which took an estimated $18.2m over the weekend. The Joker sequel was also beaten into third spot by animated film The Wild Robot, which held on to second place, taking $13.4m.\n\nFilm critics have offered a range of views about Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, calling it \"bleak and daring\" but also \"depressingly dull and plodding\". Rounding out the North American top five was comedy-drama Piece by Piece, which uses Lego animation and features a stellar voice cast including Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Gwen Stefani, Justin Timberlake and Busta Rhymes.\n\nMeanwhile, The Apprentice, a film about Donald Trump, managed only to open in the number-10 spot, with $1.6m. The film will have its UK premiere as part of the London Film Festival on Tuesday. It had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, in May, attracting mostly good reviews from critics but a legal threat from the former president. The biopic traces the US presidential candidate's origin story as an ambitious young property developer in 1970s and 80s New York. His spokesman back in May described the film, which features a scene where he is seen raping his first wife Ivana, as \"garbage\", \"pure fiction\" and \"election interference by Hollywood elites\". Now Trump has criticised the film, writing in a late-night post on his Truth Social app that he saw it as a \u201cpolitically disgusting hatchet job\u201d. The film begins with a disclaimer that many of its events are fictionalised.",

Watch: Fireworks set off on Scottish streets on Bonfire Night\n\nFirefighters say they were \"bombarded\" by missiles and fireworks on Bonfire Night, while crews responded to more than 1,000 emergency calls. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said there were six incidents where teams were attacked - three in Clydebank, two in Edinburgh and one in Blackridge in West Lothian. Police officers were also attacked with fireworks, bricks and bottles but said incidents of serious disorder had fallen this year. The force said the attacks on emergency services were \"wholly unacceptable\" and officers were working to trace those responsible.\n\nAndy Watt, deputy chief officer for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the attacks prevented crews from dealing with emergencies swiftly. He said: \"This type of behaviour is, of course, carried out by a very small minority and we once again thank our communities for their continuing support and working together with us to stay safe across the Bonfire period.\u201d Police were called to tackle disorder in Edinburgh, Glasgow and other parts of the country. The force said large groups of youths had gathered in Niddrie, Sighthill and Moredun in Edinburgh and thrown fireworks, bottles and bricks at cars and police vehicles. A police helicopter was brought in to assist with the operation.\n\nMasked youths faced off with police officers in Edinburgh\n\nA large group of youths gathered on Hay Avenue on Tuesday evening\n\nA 42-year-old mother who lives on Hay Avenue told the BBC that dozens of young people arrived on her street at 20:30 and began setting off fireworks. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she feared the group would break her window because a firework had hit her property last year. \u201cBecause it was so bad last year I asked my husband not to go to work so he could be with us this year,\" she said. Niddrie resident George Pringle, 72, has lived on Hay Avenue for 10 years - he heard fireworks being set off near his home but kept his curtains closed. \"I could hear big bangs which were setting off the car alarms,\" he said. \"I just turned the TV up and let them get on with it.\"\n\nGeorge Pringle witnessed a bonfire in the middle of the road outside his house\n\nFireworks are hurled at police officers in riot gear in Niddrie\n\nEarlier this week Mr Pringle witnessed a large bonfire in the middle of the street outside his house. \u201cThe flames were as high as a man and I saw about five teenagers around it,\" he said. \u201cThere is nothing we can do about it. They need to stop selling them fireworks in the local shops.\u201d In the west of the city, the Macklin Motors Hyundai car dealership on Calder Road was targeted by vandals. Several car windows were smashed and bodywork was dented and scratched.\n\nVandals smashed car windows at the dealership on Calder Road\n\nStaff at a nearby BP petrol station told the BBC they had to seal off pumps to prevent an explosion as fireworks were being launched into the restaurant next door. Control zones banning the use of fireworks in certain areas of Edinburgh are in place until 10 November for the first time. Parts of Glasgow were due to be covered by a similar ban but it was was delayed until next year due to a council error. Police said there were pockets of disorder in Glasgow, with youths throwing fireworks at members of the public, vehicles and police officers. Footage taken in Pollokshields, in the south side of the city, showed fireworks being set off by a group in the middle of the street. The Unison union said residents had seen large groups of young men causing disorder until 02:00, firing \"industrial-sized\" fireworks at people, buildings and cars, and setting fire to public property.\n\nAnti-fireworks campaigner and Pollokshields resident Danny Phillips called it the \"worst firework disorder in years\" and criticised the council for failing to implement the control zone. He said: \u201cWe warned them that this would happen again. The city council\u2019s incompetent blunder, failing to implement our no firework zone, has had a very heavy cost.\" No one was injured in incidents in Glasgow and Edinburgh, police confirmed. A 25-year-old man was arrested and a \"significant quantity\" of fireworks seized after a search of a van in Drumchapel. The force said the fireworks were being sold to the general public, including to under-age children. Meanwhile, in Peterhead at about 21:20, a man was hit by a van driven by individuals who, moments before, had set off a pyrotechnic in a skate park in Aalesund Road. The 33-year-old was treated by paramedics at the scene but did not need further medical attention. Two men, aged 62 and 57, have been arrested in connection with the incident.\n\nGus Sproul, chair of the Fire Brigades Union in Scotland, said there had been a \"concerning\" increase in the number of attacks on firefighters and blamed cuts to public services. However Police Scotland said the incidents of serious disorder had fallen this year. As part of Operation Moonbeam, a police operation launched in 2020 to deal with disorder at this time of year, specialist resources were deployed 26 times on 5 November last year - this year there were 18 deployments. The number of injured officers has also reduced significantly - 62 last year compared to one this year. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs, gold commander for Operation Moonbeam said challenging scenes had not escalated to mass disorder as it had last year. He said: \"Nevertheless, the levels of violence and aggression police officers, fire service and ambulance service personnel faced in some areas was wholly unacceptable and a significant investigative response is now underway to identify each and every one of those involved and bring them to justice.\" He added that discussions with local authorities and the Scottish government were ongoing to explore more ways to reduce fireworks offences in future. First Minister John Swinney said it was \"completely unacceptable\" for emergency workers to be attacked, adding: \"I think the fact that we\u2019ve had a lower incidence of events as a consequence of fireworks gives me encouragement that the steps we are taking are having an effect.\"\n\nWere you affected by firework display disruptions or disorder?

    "Kaide Ellis and Elliot Minchella will go head-to-head at loose-forward in Saturday's Super League Grand Final\n\nVenue: Old Trafford Date: Saturday, 12 October Kick-off: 18:00 BST Coverage: Commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, live text on the BBC Sport website and app; highlights on BBC Two at 14:50 on Sunday, 13 October and on BBC iPlayer.\n\nSaturday's Super League Grand Final between Wigan Warriors and Hull KR is the perfect example of how getting things right off the field can stimulate on-field growth. It is a case study in being sustainable, being present in your community and being shrewd with your recruitment. And, in this case, it all still adds up to sporting excellence and a Grand Final to savour in terms of the quality on show. Reigning champions Wigan have been a vanguard of how to 'do it right' for some time. Already a rugby league heavyweight through years of success, under chief executive Kris Radlinski - a former star - they have not rested on their laurels and the rewards have been evident. Their opponents at Old Trafford, Hull KR, have made great strides too. They sought to assemble a board of multiple talents in terms of business and industry, acquiring specific skills for marketing and revenue, again with a chief executive in Paul Lakin taking the lead. Yet, they have been equally astute on the footballing side. Expertise on and off the field. The blueprint is there for all to see.\n\nWhile the business acumen of both clubs can be appreciated and has certainly positioned these two sides to take part in this huge fixture, it is the quality on the field that whets the appetite. Almost every position brings together a meeting of substance, but nowhere quite like in the halves where two of the game's most entertaining characters will be in the spotlight. Mikey Lewis comes into Saturday's final for Hull KR as the 2024 Steve Prescott MBE Man of Steel, following a season of terrorising defences and wowing crowds with his devilish steps, array of tricks and mesmerising footwork. He racked up 24 assists and 19 tries, as well as showing new-found maturity all without losing that little edge of spikiness which all the best players need.\n\nHull KR's Mikey Lewis has retained his edge as a player, but matured enough for flashpoints not to hamper his effectiveness\n\nIt was fitting that he inherited the award from Wigan playmaker Bevan French, who but for injury which ruled him out of a chunk of the campaign, would have surely challenged to retain the crown. French's magnificence comes in many forms. Like Lewis he is a creator with 14 assists for his array of team-mates, and equally a finisher with 16 tries - 22 in all competitions. What both players possess is that ability to draw something from nothing. Seemingly magical powers, and proof that rugby league is more than physicality and brute strength. The two loose-forwards, in Wigan's Kaide Ellis and the Robins' Elliot Minchella, epitomise the mix of brains and brawn required in modern rugby league. They can pass, hit and lead with authority in equal measure.\n\nRadlinski has proven himself as adept at running a rugby league club as he did running through defences in his decorated career as an elite full-back. Having soaked up some of Wigan's greatest moments during the tail-end of their winter-era dynasty and later as they showed their Super League prowess in the switch to summer, the 48-year-old knew what it took to achieve success. His fingerprints can be seen heavily across some of the club's recent ventures; it was he who triggered the Las Vegas adventure in 2025 and got the NRL on board to see Wigan and Warrington play as part of that showpiece event. Robin Park, their training-ground home, has become an open-house base with the welcome equally as extended to the women, wheelchair, learning disability and physical disability teams as the first team. But perhaps Wigan's most impressive play was recruiting head coach Matt Peet. Wigan have been a club that has happily recruited from within. Australian coach Michael Maguire was brought in in 2010 to establish a hard-nosed culture and Shaun Wane was his dedicated assistant.\n\nMatt Peet flanked by two of his main architects at Wigan, Bevan French (left) and captain Liam Farrell - a doubt for Saturday\n\nOnce Maguire left to fulfil his NRL ambitions, Wane was subsequently promoted to the top job and was to continue the legacy. Peet enjoyed a similar trajectory, working his way through a number of roles and a spell in rugby union to succeed Adrian Lam after the 2021 season. His even-keel nature, thoughtfulness and ability to draw on the expertise of others have allowed him to navigate Wigan to success. And boy, what success. Two Challenge Cups, two League Leaders' Shields, a World Club Challenge win over four-in-a-row premiers Penrith, and a Grand Final. Soon, they hope in Wigan, to become two. Players love his manner, he believes in the collective and has sold that to his players. Never too high, never too low. But always on. Peet trusts in youth, and has been rewarded. Brad O'Neill, Zach Eckersley and perhaps the most impressive young player in the country Junior Nsemba have all thrived under his guidance and pay tribute to his coaching. His side has lifted trophy after trophy, enviably. But it is success built on humility and hard work.\n\nSuch is the buzz at Hull KR these days, even pop-rockers Coldplay have opted to sample the East Stand atmosphere by booking a couple of dates to play at Sewell Group Craven Park in August 2025. It is just another example of how the club have thought outside the box, far beyond the realms of a rugby league organisation. Ventures such as Craven Str-eat, a selection of food outlets and bars plus musical entertainment have turned a seemingly unusable space behind the posts at the south end of the ground into a buzzing pre and post-match destination for fans to congregate and enjoy. Attendances have rocketed with a new average attendance record in 2024 in excess of 9,000. That has clearly required more than some tasty snack offerings, it has been in tandem with impressive form on the field.\n\nWillie Peters (right) has brought Elliot Minchella's best rugby league to the fore, earning him England recognition.\n\nWillie Peters' arrival as head coach in 2023 took the good work of Tim Sheens and Tony Smith, turbo-boosting progress with his accessible yet demanding approach. Peters is a hard taskmaster in terms of application from his players, but equally has generated a great team spirit to match to the work ethic - and it won him the Coach of the Year for 2024. The matured improvement of Lewis, the emergence of Minchella as leader and international player, the revitalisation of Jai Whitbread and Kelepi Tanginoa - the evidence of his coaching is tangible. After reaching the Challenge Cup final in 2023, the Robins have now finished in their highest position since 1985 and are into their first Grand Final. Whatever happens on the night at Old Trafford, with a multi-faceted, multi-skilled board, the passion and investment of Neil Hudgell, and a talented squad led by Peters, it ought not to be the last big occasion for those in the east of Hull.",
    "Police have raided a pizzeria in western Germany which they alleged served customers a side of cocaine when they ordered item number 40 on the menu. Authorities were tipped off about the scheme in March by food inspectors, and drug squad officers began watching the restaurant, criminal director Michael Graf von Moltke said on Monday. When police went to detain the pizzeria manager at his apartment, the 36-year-old reportedly threw a bag of drugs out of the window, which \"fell right into the arms of the police officers\", D\u00fcsseldorf police said. Police found 1.6kg (3.5lb) of cocaine, 400g (14.1oz) of cannabis and \u20ac268,000 (\u00a3223,120) in cash in the apartment.\n\nThe restaurant manager was released by police a few days later, and he reopened his restaurant and continued to sell the drug and pizza combination. Investigators used the opportunity to explore the drug supply chain to the pizzeria, leading them to bust a drug ring in western Germany weeks later. Around 150 officers raided two cannabis plantations - one in M\u00f6nchengladbach, to the west of D\u00fcsseldorf where 300 plants were found, and another in Solingen, to the east of the city, where 60 plants were found. The homes and businesses of 12 suspects were also raided, resulting in the arrests of three people, including a 22-year-old suspected of being the head of the drug operation. Police also found weapons, money and expensive watches during the raids. The pizzeria manager was rearrested while trying to leave the country and remains in custody. \"The number 40 was one of the best-selling pizzas,\" Mr Moltke said. Police have not released the name of others involved in the drug operation, or the price of the pizza and cocaine combination.",
    "Chris Mason: What happens next after shock Tory leadership vote\n\nThe shock at the elimination of James Cleverly was near universal. Not only had he failed to muster the handful of extra votes to make it into the last two, he had actually gone backwards. How on Earth did that happen? In a secret ballot, theories vary, but cock-up attracts more credibility than conspiracy among the various campaigns.\n\nSome reckon some Conservative MPs concluded Cleverly was home and dry and so they could afford to vote for someone else, in the hope that contributed to the elimination of the candidate they really didn\u2019t want to make the run-off. Others say the other two campaigns were simply more effective and more persuasive when it really counted. And, to be honest, it no longer matters. The final pair have been decided and it is Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, not either or.\n\nShorthand political labels for folk within a political party are often inadequate in capturing the subtlety of their outlook \u2013 but those who see themselves as centrist, or on the Left of the Conservative fold, find themselves without a flagbearer to pick from. They express disappointment there isn\u2019t a greater breadth of choice reflected in the final two, which is made up of two candidates who see themselves as on the Right on the party. Robert Jenrick has moved to the Right since becoming an MP, his experience in government shifting his instincts on immigration for instance. Kemi Badenoch is seen by her supporters as nothing less than a potential star: pugnacious in articulating her Conservatism, willing to say what others won\u2019t. But even her backers admit as one put it to me that she is a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d more vulnerable to foot in mouth moments as well as incidences of triumph. This race now changes gear. It is a new election, with a new electorate. No longer just the 121 Conservative MPs but tens of thousands of Tory party members all around the UK. Team Jenrick see themselves as the challengers, the underdogs. And their strategy appears to embrace that: challenging Kemi Badenoch to debate them any time, any place, anywhere. Jenrick will be straight out of the blocks with a speech in Westminster on Thursday. Team Badenoch point out that they topped the MPs ballot and surveys suggest she is consistently the most popular potential leader among the party membership. She will begin this next phase of her campaign alongside an aspiring Tory councillor contesting a council by-election on the outskirts of London. It might sound low-key, but remember who the electorate is: Conservative Party members, just like that council candidate. From both candidates, we can expect a laser focus on the issues that are perceived to matter to party members and attempting to meet as many of them as possible. Yes, there will be a nod to the wider electorate, a desire to illustrate the capacity to win a general election, but those with a vote in this contest are those who wield the power now. Ballot papers will be sent out in the coming days and party members will have a little over a fortnight to vote, on paper or online. And then, three weeks on Saturday, 2 November, Rishi Sunak\u2019s successor will be announced. That point will mark the end of the post-election period in British politics. By then the government will have set out its first Budget and a new Leader of the Opposition will be in place. The political landscape of the coming years will have taken shape.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "The high-speed ICE train in Hamburg had travelled from Frankfurt (file pic)\n\nA station platform has been cordoned off at Hamburg central station in northern Germany amid fears that a train passenger may have arrived carrying a dangerous virus. A fire department spokesman told the Bild tabloid that the man and his girlfriend had developed flu-like symptoms on a high-speed train from Frankfurt. The spokesman said they had come from abroad where they had been treating a man who went on to develop an infectious disease, without giving details of the illness. It was unclear what was wrong with them but the man, who was reported to be a medical student, did not have a fever. Hamburg's Morgenpost website said they had arrived in Frankfurt from Rwanda on Wednesday morning. A team of police and firefighters went to the station and the man and his girlfriend were then taken to a specialist clinic. Platform four was closed for a period before it was allowed to reopen.

    "Beyonc\u00e9 to star in NFL half-time show on Christmas Day\n\nThe Christmas Day show will be the first time Beyonc\u00e9 has performed Cowboy Carter live\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has announced she will perform during the NFL's half-time show on Christmas Day. The singer will perform as the Houston Texans take on the Baltimore Ravens - one of two fixtures scheduled for that day. The second match will see Kansas City Chiefs play the Pittsburgh Steelers and both matches will be streamed on Netflix. It will be the first time Beyonc\u00e9 has performed tracks from her latest album, Cowboy Carter, which she first revealed during February's Super Bowl.\n\nShe released singles Texas Hold 'Em and 16 Carriages immediately after appearing in an advert during the game, and dropped Cowboy Carter in March. The album, which includes duets with Miley Cyrus and Post Malone, leans into the country genre and is the second of a planned trilogy that started with Renaissance. It is nominated for Album of the Year at 2025's Grammy Awards, where Beyonc\u00e9's up for a further 10 trophies including best country album and song of the year for Texas Hold 'Em. The singer announced the half-time show with posts on her socials where she's seen catching a football while standing on a classic American car covered in roses, all while wearing her signature cowboy hat. Netflix has also teased that the singer's expected to \"bring along some special guests\" who featured on her latest release. It won't be the first time Beyonc\u00e9's starred in a half-time show, having headlined the Super Bowl in 2013 and performed alongside Coldplay and Bruno Mars in 2016 - the most watched half-time show ever.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 performed with Chris Martin and Bruno Mars in 2016 and is expected to bring out special guests in December\n\nChristmas Day games have become a staple of the NFL calendar since first launching in the 1980s. In May, Netflix announced it had signed a deal to broadcast NFL games up to 2026 as part of a drive to expand into sports. \"Last year, we decided to take a big bet on live,\" the streaming platform's chief content officer, Bela Bajaria, said. \"There are no live annual events, sports or otherwise, that compare with the audiences NFL football attracts.\" On Friday, Netflix streamed boxing for the first time with a live fight between heavyweight legend Mike Tyson and YouTuber Jake Paul. It said 60 million households streamed the fight around the world, but some complained about it crashing.\n\nNFL fans in competing team cities will still be able to watch the match on broadcast TV and they'll also be available to stream on the NFL+ app in the US. NFL bosses say the deal with Netflix is a good opportunity to open the game up to fans outside of the US too. \"We couldn\u2019t be more excited to be the first professional sports league to partner with Netflix to bring live games to fans around the world,\u201d Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution, said. \"The NFL on Christmas has become a tradition and to partner with Netflix, a service whose biggest day of the year is typically this holiday, is the perfect combination to grow this event globally for NFL fans.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "Ireland and New Zealand have won five apiece in their past 10 encounters, but the All Blacks have won both World Cup games\n\nCoverage: Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Sounds; follow live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe message has been clear from Ireland all week: when they face New Zealand on Friday, revenge will not be on the menu. Hugo Keenan said it last week from the pleasant climes of the Algarve, Ireland's second home, and Andy Farrell repeated it when he spoke to reporters in Dublin on Wednesday. And while most of the Ireland camp would insist they have moved on from last year's agonising World Cup quarter-final loss in Paris, Tadhg Beirne felt moved to admit that his dreams are still haunted by the experience. Proof, as if it were needed, that the pain remains. For Ireland, Friday's match - regardless of the result - cannot banish the hurt that hit them like a hammer when, after 37 increasingly desperate phases, their World Cup was ended when Sam Whitelock won a penalty for the All Blacks. To exorcise the ghosts of Paris, they must wait until 2027. Friday, however, at least gives the world's number-one side the chance to regain the upper hand in a rivalry that has transfixed the rugby world in recent years. Indeed, it is a rivalry that has produced a string of memorable fixtures across the globe. There has been Irish ecstasy in Chicago and Wellington, the scenes of Ireland's first win and first series triumph over the All Blacks, mixed with Kiwi joy in Tokyo and Paris, where they condemned the green machine to their sixth and seventh World Cup quarter-final exits. There have been stunning individual tries, from Jacob Stockdale's chip-and-chase setting Lansdowne Road alight in 2018, to Ardie Savea's stunner in Auckland in 2022. It has brought pure emotion to the surface, too, from Peter O'Mahony sobbing euphorically in Wellington to Johnny Sexton staring into the abyss in Paris. And like any good rivalry, it has seen its fair share of needle, with Sexton and Rieko Ioane's Paris spat ratcheting up the tension for this week.\n\nFarrell said on Wednesday that too much has happened since the World Cup for Ireland to dwell on disappointment. He is not wrong. This year, Ireland retained their Six Nations title and earned a series draw in South Africa thanks to an enthralling 25-24 win over the world champions in the second Test in Durban. Much has changed for Farrell, too, having been confirmed as the British and Irish Lions head coach for next year's tour to Australia. Farrell will get a good look at Joe Schmidt's Wallabies in Dublin on 30 November, but for now his mind has been fixed on another dance with the All Blacks. Even with the knowledge that this is his last block of Ireland games for a year, Farrell has resisted the urge to experiment. His line-up features 10 of the 15 that started in Paris while his backline has been strengthened by the return of Keenan, Mack Hansen and Jamison Gibson-Park, all of whom missed the South Africa tour. There is experience on the bench, also, with three Test centurions in O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray, while Iain Henderson is not too far behind them. The obvious Irish absentee is Sexton. The iconic fly-half is now working as a consultancy coach for Ireland, but he will not be with the team on Friday. It is, therefore, a big night for Jack Crowley and the same can be said for Finlay Bealham, who replaces the injured Tadhg Furlong at tight-head prop. Ireland's scrum faltered in Paris a year ago. Without Furlong and first-choice hooker Dan Sheehan, it will face another stiff test on Friday, even against an All Black front row lacking the power of Ethan de Groot and Codie Taylor.\n\nArdie Savea was a star performer in New Zealand's World Cup quarter-final win over Ireland\n\nOf course, De Groot and Taylor are not the only players missing from a New Zealand side in transition at the end of a gruelling first year under Scott Robertson. Owing to a mix of retirements, injuries and overseas transfers, Robertson is also without Whitelock, Beauden Barrett, Brodie Retallick, Aaron Smith and Richie Mo'unga. They, too, have absorbed a great deal of pain in the last year. They lost the World Cup final to South Africa by a point, have suffered three defeats this year and were an accurate George Ford kick away from leaving Twickenham with another loss last week. But they still possess some exceptional players. In Will Jordan and Mark Tele'a - who missed the World Cup game for disciplinary reasons - they have two of the most devastating finishers in the game. Caleb Clarke, who this week revealed his Irish roots, does not have a bad strike-rate either. Damian McKenzie - Barrett's replacement at fly-half - does not always convince at 10 but clearly has big-game mettle, as evidenced by his nerveless match-winning sideline conversion against England. Then there is the back row, which contains hugely exciting flanker Wallace Sititi and the reigning world player of the year Savea, who played out of his skin in Paris a year ago. Last but not least, Ioane starts at 13. He is likely to be the pantomime villain at the Aviva. Not that this rivalry needs one. It is more compelling than ever and will have the watching world in its thrall all over again on Friday.",
    "The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) is launching an \"urgent\" fundraising drive to help people \"devastated\" by the conflicts in the Middle East. The DEC, which brings together 15 of the UK\u2019s biggest aid charities including Oxfam, British Red Cross and ActionAid - says the scale of need is \"overwhelming\". It says people across Gaza, Lebanon and the wider region require food, shelter and medical care after fleeing their homes in search of safety - and donations will be matched by the UK government up to the first \u00a310m. The Middle East Humanitarian Appeal will feature across the BBC on 17 October, as well as on other broadcasters including Sky, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.\n\nThere has been intense conflict across the Middle East since 7 October last year, when Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages when the group launched a surprise assault on communities in southern Israel. Since then, Israeli assaults on Gaza have killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the region's Hamas-run health ministry, and war has spread to Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Launching the campaign, the committee said the devastation caused by the conflicts meant thousands of people were dying from hunger and disease. At a press conference launching the appeal, the DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said people in Gaza are \"dying of hunger and disease\" and \"UN experts have warned that there is a risk of famine across the Gaza strip, as long as the conflict continues.\". On Lebanon he added: \u201cYears of economic crisis, political turmoil and ongoing conflict in Lebanon have taken a terrible toll and left the country ill equipped to handle a humanitarian crisis at this scale.\u201d In Lebanon, where its government estimates 1.2 million people have been displaced, the DEC said \"shelters are overwhelmed and hospitals are struggling to cope\". In the West Bank, it said \"water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure\" have been damaged by \"ongoing violence\". In a statement ahead of the launch, Mr Saeed said member charities are already responding to the situation in Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank, but they \"urgently need more funds to meet the huge levels of need\". He also said the group was monitoring the situation in Israel, where there are \"tens of thousands\" of displaced people, and it would provide support \"if significant unmet humanitarian needs are identified\". Save the Children is a member of the DEC, and its humanitarian director Rachael Cummings recently returned from Gaza. \"The rate that people\u2019s health is deteriorating is extraordinary... We are seeing increases in children with diarrhoea, jaundice, respiratory conditions,\" she said. Anneliese Dodds, minister of state for development, said: \"Humanitarian support is urgently needed for the most vulnerable people. Charities play a crucial role in providing help to those most affected.\" She added: \"That is why we are matching public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee's Middle East Humanitarian Appeal.\" The DEC, external has held emergency appeals for other conflicts and global catastrophes, such as the war in Ukraine and 2023's devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria.",

While Raphinha will rightly get plaudits for his superb hat-trick, Barcelona's win was built off Marc Casado, Pedri and Fermin Lopez's tireless work in the middle. All three are just 21 years old, while two of them are fortunate to even be in the side. \"If Barcelona had the money, they'd have Bernardo Silva, they would have kept Ilkay Gundogan and those two would have played,\" Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told the BBC MOTD Champions League Highlights show. \"Those who are injured like Gavi, Andreas Christensen and Frenkie de Jong would have played ahead of two of these three. Only Pedri would be in the line-up.\" Instead, it is Casado and Lopez who are partnering Pedri and slowly becoming household names. Having kept Bayern's experienced trio of Thomas Muller, Joshua Kimmich and Joao Palhinha - who have 21 league titles between them - at bay, Barcelona may have stumbled on the perfect midfield three.\n\nMarc Casado (left), Pedri (centre) and Fermin Lopez (right) starred for Barcelona against Bayern Munich in just their third start together this season\n\nLiverpool defender Stephen Warnock called the trio \"exceptional\" and said they \"constantly allowed Barcelona to play\". Casado, who Warnock said had a natural \"understanding of how to read danger\" was the deepest of the three midfielders, shielding the defence and winning the ball back for his side. The former Barcelona B captain only made his first Barcelona start this season, but has become a regular for Haasi Flick's side, getting the nod in all of their Champions League matches this term, and came up with an assist on Wednesday. \"Casado played twice for Xavi last season and Xavi was told if you put Casado in the team enough, he wouldn\u2019t come out of it,\" added Balague. \"Xavi thought he was too short for a holding midfielder, but he\u2019s in now.\" Just ahead of Casado was Pedri, already a superstar and a true champion of the transition, constantly receiving the ball off his defenders and playing it forward. Pedri joined Barca from Las Palmas in 2020 at the age of 16, won the Golden Boy award in 2021 and, that same year, ended up signing a contract extension which included a 1bn euro (\u00a3846m) release clause.\n\nAnd finally, completing the midfield trio and playing as a number 10 was Lopez. The youngster was given a licence to roam forward against Bayern and often ended up as the furthest player forward as he assisted both Barca's first and second goals. \u201cLopez's understanding of when to be dropping short and when to become that second striker is brilliant,\" added Warnock. There was more youthful brilliance off the bench for Barcelona with 20-year-old Gavi, who won the Golden Boy award in 2022 and is recovering from an injury, coming on for the final five minutes. Plus, 17-year-old winger Lamine Yamal starred out wide and also grabbed an assist, setting up Raphinha for his hat-trick. The future looks bright for Barcelona.\n\nWith youngsters Marc Casado, Pedri and Lamine Yamal in the side, Barcelona had an average starting XI age of 24 years and 185 days\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",
    "Terryon Thomas, who has 4.3 million followers on TikTok, is accused of killing a Louisiana therapist\n\nA popular TikTok creator has been charged with second degree murder in the death of a 69-year-old Louisiana therapist. Terryon Thomas, also known as Mr Prada to his 4.3 million followers, was arrested in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday afternoon after he was allegedly seen driving a stolen car that police said belonged to William Abraham, the therapist. Mr Abraham\u2019s body was found wrapped in a tarp on Sunday in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Police said he died from blunt force trauma to the head, describing it as a \u201cvery physical, very violent death\u201d.\n\nMr Thomas, 20, has been charged with second degree murder and obstruction of justice, according to the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office, and is in custody in Dallas, Texas awaiting extradition to Louisiana. \u201cThis is an ongoing investigation that will take time to gather further evidence,\u201d Casey Hicks of the East Baton Rouge\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement. \u201cI hope that this arrest may bring some closure and assurance to friends and family,\u201d she said. Mr Abraham\u2019s body was found in a blue tarp on the east side of US Highway 51 on Sunday, police said, adding that they later discovered his car had been missing. Police said they later uncovered surveillance footage that purportedly identified Mr Thomas as the last person seen driving the therapist\u2019s vehicle. They then attempted a traffic stop on Mr Thomas, but he allegedly resisted arrest, backed up into the officers\u2019 car and fled. Police searched Mr Thomas\u2019 apartment in Baton Rouge, where they allegedly found evidence of a \u201cviolent physical altercation\u201d and \u201ca significant amount of blood\u201d and unspecified weapons. They added that witnesses allegedly saw Mr Thomas dragging \u201can object wrapped in a blue-coloured tarp\u201d into the therapist\u2019s car on Saturday, 28 September, the day before Mr Abraham\u2019s body was found. Police said video surveillance footage also apparently showed Mr Abraham arriving earlier that day at the apartment complex where Mr Thomas lived, wearing the same clothes that his deceased body had been found in. Police did not specify how Mr Thomas and Mr Abraham knew each other, or if Mr Thomas was a client of the therapist. Mr Thomas is well-known on the social media app TikTok, where he posts videos for millions of mostly Gen Z followers with commentary on school, relationships and trends. According to Mr Abraham\u2019s obituary, the victim was a \u201clicensed professional counsellor, motivational speaker, recording artist, author and teacher\u201d. He was also a former Catholic priest who had regular appearances on local television in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\u2022 None TikToker and mum jailed for life for crash murders",
    "Democrats' bet on a generation of liberal voters has backfired badly\n\nDonald Trump swept to victory on Tuesday by chipping away at groups of voters which Democrats once believed would help them win the White House for a generation. After Barack Obama\u2019s victory in 2008, many triumphantly claimed that the liberal voting coalition which had elected the first black president was growing more powerful, as the makeup of America changed. Older, white conservatives were reducing in number, and non-white Americans were projected to be in the majority by 2044. College-educated professionals, younger people, black Americans, Latinos and other ethnic minorities, and blue-collar workers were part of a \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d. These voters were left-leaning on cultural issues and supportive of an active federal government and a strong social safety net. And they constituted a majority in enough states to ensure a Democratic lock on the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency. \u201cDemography,\u201d these left-wing optimists liked to say, \u201cis destiny.\u201d Sixteen years later, however, that destiny appears to have turned to dust.\n\nCracks began forming when non-college educated voters slipped away from the Democrats in midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. They then broke en masse to Trump in 2016. While Joe Biden, with his working-class-friendly reputation built over half a century, won enough back to take the White House in 2020, his success proved to be only a temporary reprieve.\n\nThis year, Trump supplemented his gains with the blue-collar workers by also cutting into the Democratic margins among young, Latino and black voters. He has carved up the coalition of the ascendant. - 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain\u2019s 4% against Obama - 46% of the Latino vote this time, while McCain got 31% in 2008 - 43% of voters under 30 against the 32% for McCain - 56% of those without a college degree - back in 2008, it was Obama who won a majority Speaking on Thursday after his comeback victory, Trump celebrated his own diverse coalition of voters. \u201cI started to see realignment could happen because the Democrats are not in line with the thinking of the country,\" the president-elect told NBC News.\n\nTrump did it with a hard-line message on immigration that included border enforcement and mass deportations \u2013 policies that Biden and the Democrats recoiled from when they took power back from Trump in 2021, lest they anger immigrant rights activists in their liberal base. Illegal border crossings reached record levels under the Biden administration, with more than eight million encounters with migrants at the border with Mexico. \u201cIf you watch a video from Hillary Clinton back in 2008 in the primaries, she talks about making sure there's wall-building, making sure that immigrants who violate the law get deported, making sure everybody learns English,\u201d said Kevin Marino Cabrera, a Republican commissioner in Miami-Dade County. \u201cIt's funny how far to the left [the Democrats] have gone.\u201d This week, Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win that heavily Latino county in Florida. He also won Starr County in south Texas, with its 97% Latino population, with 57% of the vote. In 2008, only 15% of the county voted for McCain, the Republican. Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an \u201caggrieved racial minority\u201d. \u201cBut that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,\u201d he added. \u201cI hate that if you\u2019re black, you've got to be a Democrat or you hate black people and you hate your community,\u201d Kenard Holmes, a 20-year-old student in South Carolina, told the BBC during the presidential primaries earlier this year. He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.\n\nWith some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240. It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short. In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008. Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris. \u201cWe're just sick of hearing about identity politics,\" said Nicole Williams, a white bartender with a black husband and biracial children in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 one of the key battleground states that Trump flipped this year. \u201cWe're just American, and we just want what's best for Americans,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. US voters on one reason Trump won... and why Harris lost\n\nDemocrats are already engaged in considerable soul-searching, as they come to grips with an election defeat that has delivered the White House, the Senate and, perhaps, the House of Representatives to Republican control. Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power. Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters. Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.\n\nAmong the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans. Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history. Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What does MAGA mean to these Trump supporters?\n\nIn the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus. One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact. It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion. After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues. \u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times., external \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response, external: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today. \u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.\n\nFuture elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign. But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come. The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic. \u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.\u201d Moses Santana, a Puerto Rican living in Philadelphia, is from a demographic which seemed reliably Democratic a decade or so ago. But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him. \u201cYou know, Joe Biden promised a lot of progressive things, like he was going to cancel student debt, he was going to help people get their citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of that happened.

    "New young drivers should not carry under-21s as passengers - AA\n\nDrivers aged under 21 who have just passed their tests should be prevented from carrying passengers of a similar age for their first six months as drivers, the AA has said. It suggested tougher rules that would also see them handed six penalty points for not wearing a seatbelt during the period - meaning they could lose their licence. The motoring organisation says the proposal for a particular type of licence targeted at new, young drivers has the potential to prevent 934 serious injuries and save 58 lives on UK roads each year. Similar measures - known as graduated driving licensing (GDL) - already exist in Northern Ireland. The Department for Transport (DfT) has said it is not currently considering the measures for elsewhere in the UK.\n\nIf it were brought in across the UK, it would mean young drivers marking their vehicles with G plates - with a failure to display them punishable with three points on their licence. While the proposed changes focus on younger drivers, in other jurisdictions - like Canada - all new drivers are subject to restrictions after passing their test, regardless of age. Crystal Owen's 17-year-old son Harvey died in a car crash in November 2023 along with three of his friends while on a camping trip in Gwynedd, north Wales. Now a campaigner, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that bringing in this new type of licence would \"massively help\" reduce incidents on the roads. \"There are not many times when having to take your friends in the car is a necessity. It\u2019s to protect drivers, it\u2019s to save lives, and what is the alternative?\" she said. Mrs Owen said she was constantly hearing of car crashes involving \"young people with their whole lives ahead of them like my son\". She added: \"Their lives [are] gone - for what? For the sake of a few inconveniences for a very short time?\" In Northern Ireland, where GDL already exists, drivers must display amber R plates for one year the date of passing their test. There had been plans to introduce a ban by 2020 on drivers under the age of 21 from carrying passengers of a similar age for six months, but it has not happened yet. Currently in the UK, new drivers' licences can be cancelled if they get six or more points within two years of passing their test, whereas more experienced drivers can be banned with 12 or more penalty points within three years. Figures from the DfT show 290 people were killed and 4,669 were seriously injured in crashes on Britain's roads last year involving at least one driver aged 17-24. Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Jack Cousens, the AA's head of road policy, said what was noticable across countries with the policy in place was \"a reduction of death and serious injuries to younger drivers and their passengers\" by 20% to 40%. Mr Cousens said that while the government was bringing forward a road safety strategy, at the moment it was \"not convinced\" of the need for GDL. \"We feel that something has to be done, so we\u2019re going to keep banging this drum,\" he said. \"Hopefully the government will change tack and see that, actually, we need to make some changes for younger drivers.\" Mrs Owen said that road deaths receive less attention than certain types of violence crime, and that ministers \"seem to be just not listening to the advice\". \"Does it take for one of them to lose their own children to put this into place? Because I can guarantee they would [if that happened].\" A DfT spokesperson said: \"Every death on our roads is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families of everyone who has lost a loved one in this way. \"Whilst we are not considering graduated driving licences, we absolutely recognise that young people are disproportionately victims of tragic incidents on our roads, and we are considering other measures to tackle this problem and protect young drivers.\"\n\nAre you a new driver, or a driver aged under-21?",
    "Maia Sandu said the government would now have to prepare for fresh elections next year and preserve democracy\n\nMoldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu has claimed a second term after a tense election run-off seen as a choice between Europe and Russia. Sandu won 55% of the vote, according to preliminary results, and in a late-night speech on Sunday she promised to be president for all Moldovans. Her rival Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was backed by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, had called for a closer relationship with Moscow. During the day the president's national security adviser said there had been \"massive interference\" from Russia in Moldova's electoral process that had \"high potential to distort the outcome\".\n\nRussia had already denied meddling in the vote, which came a week after another key Eastern European election in Georgia, whose president said it had been a \"Russian special operation\". Stoianoglo, who was fired as prosecutor general by Sandu, has denied being pro-Kremlin. In a joint statement congratulating Sandu on her re-election, the European Commission and the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said there had been \"unprecedented interference by Russia\". As polls closed, both Sandu, 52, and her rival thanked voters, with Stoianoglo speaking in Russian as well as Romanian. Although Romanian is Moldova's main language, Russian is widely spoken because of its Soviet past.\n\nTurnout at 54% was high, especially among expat voters at polling stations abroad. Stoianoglo took an initial lead on the night and was the more successful candidate in Moldova itself with more than 51% of the vote. Sandu won in the capital Chisinau, and she was completely dominant among expat voters. As she overtook her challenger late on Sunday night, there was cheering at her campaign headquarters and chants of \"victory\". In a hoarse voice she praised her compatriots for saving Moldova and giving \"a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books\". Then, moving into Russian, she said: \"I have heard your voice \u2013 both those who supported me and those who voted for Mr. Stoianoglo. In our choice for a dignified future, no-one lost... we need to stand united.\" Maia Sandu\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Olga Rosca, told the BBC she was proud of the result. Asked whether she was surprised that Stoianoglo had won in Moldova itself, she said the vote in Moldova and abroad should be seen as one and the same: \u201cWe never divide people into Moldovans at home and expatriates - we see Moldovans as one family.\u201d With elections coming next year she said the president had \u201cclearly indicated she has heard the mood for change. On several occasions between the [two presidential] votes she said the fight against corruption must be intensified and justice reform must be accelerated \u2013 she\u2019s committed to this work\u201d. The final result will be declared on Monday. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu, saying \"it takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election. \"I'm glad to continue working with you towards a European future for Moldova and its people,\" her message on X said. Casting his ballot, Alexandr Stoianoglo had promised to be an \"apolitical president\", and that he had voted for \"a Moldova that should develop in harmony with both the West and the East\". Stoianoglo polled particularly well in rural areas and the south, while Sandu was ahead in the cities and with young voters.\n\nAfter casting her ballot, Sandu had warned of \"thieves\" who sought to buy their vote and their country. Presidential national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru said Russia had organised buses and large charter flights to bring voters to polling stations. Bomb scares had briefly disrupted voting in Moldova, at UK polling stations in Liverpool and Northampton and at Frankfurt and Kaiserslautern in Germany, he added.\n\nMoldovan expats queued to vote in big numbers in Moscow and many other cities\n\nA Soviet republic for 51 years, Moldova is flanked by Ukraine and Romania and one of Europe's poorest countries. It has a population of 2.5 million and an expat population of 1.2 million. Moldova's authorities have long warned that a fugitive oligarch called Ilan Shor has spent $39m (\u00a330m) trying to buy the election for Moscow with handouts to 138,000 Moldovans. Shor, who is based in Moscow, denies wrongdoing but did promise cash payments to anyone prepared to back his call for a \"firm No\" to the EU. Commentators and politicians had warned that a Stoianoglo victory could radically change the political landscape in the Danube and Black Sea region, not because he was some kind of \"Trojan horse\", but rather because Russia has thrown its weight behind him. There were queues at polling stations in Moscow, Italy and among voters from a mainly Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria, who had to cross the River Dniester into Moldovan-controlled territory to vote. Transnistria is home to a Russian military base and a huge arms depot.\n\nMoldova's election commission said it was aware of reports of organised and illegal transports of voters by air and land in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey, and appealed to the public to report further violations. Although Sandu had easily won the first round of the vote, several candidates swung behind Stoianoglo, although the third-placed candidate refused to back either of the two. The first round coincided with a nail-biting referendum on backing a change to the constitution embracing the commitment to join the EU. In the end the vote passed by a tiny margin in favour, and Maia Sandu said there had been clear evidence of attempts to buy 300,000 votes.",

MOTD 2: Why 'misinterpreted' Fernandes will be crucial to Amorim's United\n\nIf Ruben Amorim spent his Sunday in Lisbon tuning into events at Old Trafford, he will have witnessed a graphic illustration of the task awaiting him when he finally arrives as Manchester United manager. United, under the temporary leadership of Ruud van Nistelrooy following Erik ten Hag\u2019s sacking, were not short of effort in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea, but this grim evidence of an acute lack of quality and creation, bolted on to the vast millions wasted on poor recruitment, will have been a sobering experience for Amorim. If he did not know the industrial scale of the job he has taken on, then Amorim will no longer be under any illusions. This was not a bad United display, certainly not their worst in recent times, but all the perspiration expended could not cover up the shortage of inspiration that will be at his disposal. United\u2019s statistics say it all about their current status, measuring the distance Amorim will have to take his new charges to make them anything resembling a going Premier League concern. They are currently 13th in the table with 12 points, United\u2019s worst return after 10 games of a league campaign since 1986-87, when they had eight. That was the season the torch passed from Ron Atkinson to Sir Alex Ferguson. It eventually brought spectacular results, although it took the great Scot until 1990 to claim his first trophy in the shape of the FA Cup. And United\u2019s lack of punch is underscored by their meagre total of nine league goals, their fewest in a league campaign since 1973-74, when they also had nine. That was the season they were relegated to the former Second Division. No-one is suggesting for one moment this is the fate awaiting them this time, but this is a very average United side getting very average results, hence the acquisition of the highly-regarded Amorim. It was almost inevitable that United\u2019s goal came via Bruno Fernandes\u2019 penalty, given their lack of serious threat to Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez in the previous 70 minutes. Marcus Rashford had struck the bar in the closing seconds of the first half, but Sanchez was untroubled until he injudiciously challenged Rasmus Hojlund as the United striker appeared to lose control of the ball while moving away from goal during a rare incursion into the danger zone.\n\nManchester United captain Bruno Fernandes sums up their frustration against Chelsea at Old Trafford\n\nThe 21-year-old Dane, another who never lacks for effort, won the penalty with his only touch in the penalty area, having had none in the box in the first half. Rashford only had three touches in the box, while Garnacho \u2013 most wasteful of all \u2013 had nine touches. This attacking trio have scored only four league goals between them this season. The expected goals here was 0.4 for Garnacho, 0.2 for Rashford and 0.0 for Hojlund, a reflection of their performances so far this season. Hojlund has a shot conversion rate of 25% from four shots in the Premier League this season. Rashford\u2019s ratio is 10% from 10 shots while Garnacho is 6.9% from 29 shots \u2013 including blocks. United have scored only two first-half goals in the league this season, the joint fewest along with Crystal Palace, all figures that hint at the weaknesses Amorin must correct. In contrast to the clear identity Chelsea have quickly acquired under Enzo Maresca, all patience and possession, United look like an unconvincing collection of individuals who are banking on moments to rescue them from mediocrity. It has not happened often. Amorim will rightly take his time to measure the resources he has at his disposal, but few who faced Chelsea made a compelling case to push themselves to the forefront of the Portuguese coach\u2019s plans.\n\nRuben Amorim will be under no illusions as to the size of the task awaiting him at Manchester United\n\nGoalkeeper Andre Onana has developed into a successful signing amid the poor buys, while captain Fernandes is likely to start the course. Amorim is renowned for his three-man defensive system but the candidates to take on this role are unclear. Matthijs de Ligt is yet to convince following his move from Bayern Munich while Lisandro Martinez showed his lack of discipline with a wild late challenge on Cole Palmer, which saw him fortunate to escape a Video Assistant Review with only a yellow card. It was an awful challenge heavily laced with bad intent. Will Harry Maguire return to be factored into the Amorim equation when he is fit again, even though he is hardly a long-term bet at 31? Amorim will also need to reconstruct a chaotic midfield that currently offers little in the way of protection for a vulnerable defence, leaving United too often at the mercy of opposition able to run straight through them. He may feel there is room for development in youngsters Hojlund and Garnacho and the currently injured Kobbie Mainoo but, in time, he will need to embark on a root and branch rebuild \u2013 which will once more come at a price to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Old Trafford hierarchy. The dysfunction at the heart of United\u2019s recruitment strategy played out in front of their very eyes in the performance of Chelsea\u2019s Moises Caicedo, the game\u2019s outstanding performer who deservedly scored their equaliser with a crisp volley from the edge of the area four minutes after Fernandes struck from the spot. United passed up the opportunity to sign the 23-year-old when he was at Independiente del Valle in Ecuador. Brighton moved smartly to sign Caicedo for \u00a34.5m in February 2021, where he excelled to such an extent that he became the Premier League\u2019s most expensive player when he moved to Chelsea for \u00a3115m at the start of last season. In this time, United have squandered cash, most notably the ludicrous \u00a382m on Antony from Ajax, very much a Ten Hag production, while Joshua Zirkzee has yet to look like justifying the \u00a336m the dismissed manager paid to Bologna to sign his fellow Dutchman last summer. Amorim will also have to decide what to do with Van Nistelrooy. Clearly relishing his time in the spotlight, his wild celebration of United\u2019s goal was one of the highlights of the day. A leap and run down the touchline before pumping his fists towards the fans in ecstasy. Will Amorim want to keep a relic of the Ten Hag regime, albeit a United legend, or will he maintain his usual tight-knit group of backroom staff? It is a thorny decision given Van Nistelrooy\u2019s beloved status among United\u2019s fans \u2013 but this is surely about a fresh start, the new broom arriving from Lisbon and sweeping clean. It all adds to a mammoth task facing Amorim when he finally walks through the doors of United\u2019s Carrington training headquarters in a little over a week's time. Amorim needs better players, better recruitment, plus time and patience. He will have been even more aware of it when he switched his television off on Sunday night. It is a lot to ask for in Manchester United\u2019s current reduced circumstances \u2013 as this performance proved.",
    "'We are poisoning ourselves': Ghana gold rush sparks environmental disaster\n\nWater from a polluted river in Ghana was so thick and discoloured that an artist was able to use it as paint to depict the environmental devastation caused by the illegal gold mining that has spread like wildfire in the resource-rich West African state. Mercury is increasingly being used to extract gold by miners digging on a massive scale in forests and farms, degrading land and polluting rivers to such an extent that the charity WaterAid has called it \"ecocide\". \"I could actually paint with the water. It was so bad,\" Israel Derrick Apeti, better known as Enil Art, told the BBC. He and his friend Jay Sterling visited the Pra River - around 200km (125 miles) west of the capital, Accra - to make a point about the environmental catastrophe unfolding because of \"galamsey\". This is the term used by locals to describe the illegal mining taking place at thousands of sites around the country - including the forested regions famous for their cocoa farms, as well as their vast gold deposits. The West African state is the world's sixth-biggest gold exporter, and the second-biggest cocoa exporter. Demonstrators recently took to the streets of Accra to demand that the government take action to end the illegal mining. The police responded by detaining dozens of protesters accused of holding an illegal gathering. They were later released as anger grew over the arrests. The hashtags #stopgalamseynow and #freethecitizens were used to galvanise young people across Ghana and the diaspora, particularly in Canada and the UK, to voice their concerns.\n\nOn our way to the river, I just thought I could perhaps paint with the polluted water. It just came to me like that. So, we got there, I tried it and it worked out\"\n\nApeti told the BBC that he had decided to contribute to the campaign through art. \"What is art for?\" he said, adding: \"On our way to the river, I just thought I could perhaps paint with the polluted water. It just came to me like that. So, we got there, I tried it and it worked out.\" Communities along the river - one of the biggest in Ghana - lamented to Apeti that the water was \"once so clean that you could see the fish and crocodiles that lived in it\", but it had been transformed \"into a yellowish-brown body of water\". Ghana's music stars have also thrown their weight behind the campaign. Black Sherif - who hails from Konongo town in the Ashanti region, which has been badly affected by the illegal mining - stopped his set at The Tidal Rave Concert in Accra earlier this month to show a video of the devastation. Truth Ofori, who was part of Black Sherif's set, then sang a patriotic song called \u201cThis is our home\u201d, while Stonebowy used his set to perform \"Greedy Men\", which targeted those behind galamsey.\n\nDancehall star Stonebowy has voiced his support for the campaign against illegal mining\n\nThe devastation has been caused by the fact that the nature of illegal mining has changed - previously, young unemployed men dug with picks and shovels, or their bare hands, to search for gold. They also relied on panning - the washing of sediment through a sieve so the gold settles at the bottom. But Chinese businessmen - who first moved to Ghana around 18 years ago - have made it a more sophisticated industry. They are accused of ignoring environmental concerns and taking to heart an age-old saying: \"There is no land in Ghana which doesn\u2019t have gold, even in the top soil. Ghana is gold.\" Indeed, during colonial times the country was known as the Gold Coast. Some local businessmen and politicians are widely suspected to have joined them in what has been dubbed \"the mad gold rush\", buying out cocoa farms and turning them into illegal mining sites. They have also been accused of using intimidation if a farmer refuses to sell by digging up footpaths, and forcing them to eventually give up the land. An estimated 4,726 hectares of land - more than the size of European cities like Athens and Brussels - have been destroyed in seven of the country's 16 regions, and 34 of its 288 forest reserves, Ghana Forestry Commission head John Allotey was quoted as saying in August, external.\n\nGold found by illegal miners ends up being sold internationally\n\nAgricultural development consultant Dr John Manful told the BBC that \"precious, valuable land\" in the forest belt had been destroyed by the gold-seekers. \"Illegal small-scale mining has been taking place for decades in Ghana. However, in recent years, it has been getting out of control, having catastrophic effects,\" he said. The mining has led to the felling of trees, and the clearing of vast areas of forest vegetation. Excavators are then used to dig out the top soil and subsoil. The soil is then deposited at gold-washing plants stationed in rivers, and water is pumped to wash the soil and crushed stones. During the washing process, various chemicals, including mercury and cyanide, are used to help extract the gold from the soil, polluting big and small rivers. Highlighting the dangers of this, Dr George Manful, a former senior official in Ghana\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, said: \"Mercury can remain in water for up to 1,000 years. The water in these rivers is so turbid that it is undrinkable.\" In an interview with local broadcaster Joy FM, he also pointed out that mercury could affect the entire food chain, as it accumulates in fish and can enter crops irrigated with the water. \"We are slowly poisoning ourselves,\" Dr Manful added.\n\nDemonstrators have raised concern that water is becoming undrinkable\n\nFor its part, WaterAid urged the government to take \"immediate action to end the ecocide\", while the state water utility warned that Ghana risked becoming an importer of water by 2030 if the illegal mining was not curbed. In September, the government said that 76 people, including 18 foreign nationals, had been convicted of illegal mining since August 2021, and more than 850 others were being prosecuted. The illegal mining has also affected cocoa production, with the Ghana Cocoa Board saying in 2021 that more than 19,000 hectares of farmland had been destroyed in key cocoa-growing areas like the Western and Ashanti regions. Repeating the board's concerns earlier this week, its chief executive Joseph Boahen Aidoo said the production of cocoa - the key ingredient of chocolate - had fallen. \"Yes, it has [taken] a toll on the industry,\" he was quoted as saying by Ghana's Chronicle news site, external. The illegal mining has also affected other crops, with a rice farmer in the Ahafo region telling the BBC that she could no longer use her nearby river for irrigation purposes. \"I have to set up a whole plant that involves digging deep to find water, which is very expensive,\" she said. The farmer, who asked not to be identified, said she feared that the crisis would continue if the powerful individuals behind the illegal mining were not arrested and prosecuted. \"When I see arrests by the military in poor communities, it\u2019s just a symbolic gesture of appearing to maintain law and order. The people making big money out of it are in offices, not on the field,\u201d she said. The government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nThe state water utility has warned that pollution could force Ghana to import water\n\nThe gold rush has also been fuelled by the fact that the global price of the precious metal has risen to new heights, external, and is expected to continue doing so. The gold is smuggled out - possibly to countries like the United Arab Emirates, China and India - to be refined, mixed with legal gold, and sold on international markets, BBC business reporter Jewel Kiriungi told a World Service podcast that explored the topic. The illegal industry has also boomed because Ghana, despite being resource-rich, is facing its most severe economic crisis in a generation, with unemployment worsening and the cost of living escalating. As a result, many poor or jobless people - especially in rural areas - have either been employed by the illegal syndicates, or have simply taken up gold mining on their own, earning up to 2,000 cedis ($125; \u00a396) a week - the average monthly salary of a teacher. Apeti, the artist, said that when he visited the Pra River, he was told by locals that officials regularly carry out raids, destroying the equipment of miners. \"But that wouldn't be enough to deter them from their quest for gold, as they would return at night to start mining all over again,\" he said.\n\nThe Pra is one of several major rivers in Ghana that has been polluted\n\nAs protests took place in Accra to highlight the devastation, Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo responded last week by ordering the deployment of naval boats, external \"to ensure the immediate cessation of all mining activities, legal or illegal, in and around these water bodies\". But some senior officials in the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) said they did not expect a major crackdown, as many of their supporters in mining districts were involved in galamsey - and the party could not risk losing their votes in the December general election. The popularity of galamsey was borne out by a survey conducted by WaterAid, external in communities involved in illegal mining in Ghana\u2019s Upper East Region, particularly the Bongo and Bawku West districts. More than 75% of those surveyed saw the practice as a lucrative source of income despite 97% of them acknowledging it harmed the environment and water sources. \"Alarmingly, 79% reported health issues, such as chest pains, directly linked to their work in illegal mining,\" WaterAid added. When President Akufo-Addo first took office in 2017, he acknowledged that some security personnel, businessmen and politicians were involved in galamsey, external. He vowed \"not just to stop it, to reclaim the land, to let our rivers work again\", but also to help \"all the abled-bodied young men involved in this activity to find an alternative livelihood\". With Akufo-Addo due to step down at the end of his two terms, his critics say that he failed to fulfil his promise and the problem rather got worse during his tenure, jeopardising - as he put it in 2017 - \"the very survival of our nation\".",
    "Keith Edwards, 81, pleaded guilty to assault by beating, after becoming \"embroiled\" in protests in Nottingham\n\nAn 81-year-old man who stamped on another man who was being arrested during protests in Nottingham city centre has been sentenced. Keith Edwards, of Kinglake Place in The Meadows, Nottingham, was charged following demonstrations on 3 August. On Monday, Edwards admitted assault by beating and was given a 28-day suspended sentence at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday. He is thought to be the oldest person to be charged in the wake of the disorder that broke out across the country following the killings of three young girls at a dance class in Southport.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in the city centre as part of demonstrations organised by rival groups. Police arrested 15 people on the day, though the force said events remained \"largely peaceful\". Denis Quinn, prosecuting, said Edwards had claimed he had gone into the city centre to buy a loaf of bread, but got \"drawn into what was happening\".\n\nHundreds of people gathered in Nottingham as part of demonstrations organised by rival groups on 3 August\n\nIn footage shown to the court, Edwards could be seen walking over to a man on the floor who was being detained by three police officers, and stamping on his leg. He was also identified in an earlier clip, played in court, telling a protester \"children killed in Southport by your friends\". In bodycam footage showed to the court, Edwards was told he was being detained for \"kicking the man on the floor\", to which he corrected the officer, saying \"I stamped on his leg\". Jim Buckley, defending Edwards, added: \"Clearly this was out of character.\" Edwards had no previous convictions and told police he had never previously been arrested, the court heard.\n\nDuring sentencing, district judge Sunil Khanna told Edwards he had, \"until now\", been a man of \"impeccable character\", but got himself embroiled in what he called \"large-scale civil disorder\". He said: \"A male who was being beaten up was detained by police. \"He was lying face-down on the floor, hands behind his back, three police officers on top of him with no threat to any person. \"Despite that, you walked up and stamped on his leg. \"It's beyond me why you felt the need to do this, because clearly, everything was under control, the police had everything under control \u2013 what you did was wholly unnecessary.\" He added: \"You've never done anything like this before and I'm sure you won't again.\" Edwards was also ordered to pay court costs and a victim surcharge totalling \u00a3239.\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Nottingham",
    "Will assisted dying vote pass? It's far from clear\n\nAn extraordinary week stands ahead of us at Westminster. A week in which MPs will be asked to make a decision that could have consequences for decades. If the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill for England and Wales becomes law, it would give people, in certain circumstances, the right to die at a time of their choosing. Scotland is also considering a change in the law on the issue too. It is a colossal potential social change, compared by many to the Abortion Act of 1967, the abolition of capital punishment, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the introduction of gay marriage. Opinion polls suggest most people are broadly in favour of a change in the law and have been for years. But it is impossible to be certain how the House of Commons will vote, not least because MPs are not being instructed on how to by their parties, as normally happens.\n\nSpeaking to those on both sides of the debate who are trying to keep a track on the numbers, there is an acknowledgement that sentiment has ebbed and flowed over the last few weeks, with opponents of change perhaps gaining some momentum after the Health Secretary Wes Streeting came out on their side of the argument. It is, for so many MPs, an intensely personal moment. Their usual political compass bearings, party loyalty and a broad sense of being on the left or the right, count for little here. Instead, an experience in their own life, such as the loss of a relative or their religious conviction may weigh considerably. There are three groups of MPs on this issue. There are the unshiftably opposed, who won\u2019t change their minds whatever arguments are made in the next few days. There are the unshiftably in favour, who also won\u2019t change their minds whatever is said this week. And then there are those still making up their minds. The running tallies of public declarations leave you hundreds of MPs short and so little the wiser about how things might shake out in the end. Those in favour of change say that if all of those who have indicated privately that they are inclined to back it do back it, it will clear its first hurdle, what is known as second reading, on Friday. Those against it telling me \u201cit is on a knife edge\u201d, think the more people are exposed to the arguments the more doubts creep in and believe the debate itself on Friday will sway some people to vote against. There will be five hours of debate on Friday and I am told more than 100 MPs have said they would like to speak. That would amount to three minutes each but the indication at this stage is there won\u2019t be time limits imposed on speeches. Some of those opposed to a change in the law say the lack of time for adequate debate and scrutiny is itself a problem. Those in favour say the scope for much more detailed discussion would come after an approval in principle for a change in the law on Friday, in the far more detailed examination of the plans that would follow in the new year. They are saying to some waverers that the pragmatic thing to do if you are open minded but uncertain is to allow the debate to continue in 2025, with the option still open to reject it at a later stage. Those who are opposed point to the lack of an impact assessment \u2013 a consequence of this being a bill brought forward by a backbencher, Labour\u2019s Kim Leadbeater, rather than the government \u2013 and a fear that if the idea isn\u2019t rejected now a badly thought through idea could gather unstoppable momentum. So, in the next few days, there will be intense discussion and debate at Westminster. Talks and presentations are being held by both sides, with discussions, for instance, on opinion polling, palliative care, and international comparisons. And then, on Friday, the debate and the vote.",
    "Zelensky meets Starmer as he seeks more support for war\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has held talks with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street, as the Ukrainian president seeks to shore up European support for his country's war effort. Zelensky said he would share details of his \"victory plan\" during the meeting, while Sir Keir pledged his \"continued commitment and support\" for Ukraine. The meeting comes as the conflict with Russia heads into its third winter and amid the prospect of Donald Trump, who is widely considered to be less supportive of Ukraine, winning the US presidential election in November. Mark Rutte, the new head of the Nato military alliance, also attended Downing Street to take part in the talks with Zelensky.\n\nThe Nato chief held a one-to-one meeting with the prime minister, while Zelensky will is expected to travel to France and Italy to continue his European diplomatic tour. A red carpet was laid out in Downing Street for Zelensky's arrival and the two leaders shook hands and embraced on the steps of No 10. Speaking in No 10, the Ukrainian president said: \"Thanks to the UK people, the people of your great country, for your [strength in us] from the very beginning of the war.\" Zelensky said he would share details of Ukraine's so-called victory plan, a strategy for the next phase of the war. The president has been seeking to garner renewed support for his war efforts in recent weeks. Details of that plan have not yet been made public, but it relies on increased Western support and security guarantees. That includes setting out a clear path towards Ukraine\u2019s membership in Nato and lifting restrictions on the use of Western supplied long range weapons. Sir Keir said it was \"very important we're able to show our continued commitment to support Ukraine\" and it was a chance to \"go through the plan, to talk in more detail\". \"This is such an important fight for you and for us as well,\" the prime minister said. The head of the British armed forces, the defence secretary and the prime minister's senior national security adviser also attended talks with Zelensky and his team, which lasted for around two hours. Rutte told BBC News after the meeting that \"it's crucial for Ukraine to prevail,\" adding the situation \"is not only a problem for the Ukraine, but also a threat to all of us\".\n\nAn agenda for the Downing Street talks has not been made public, but Rutte said the parties discussed the use of British-supplied missiles on Russian territory. Zelensky has repeatedly pressed allies for his forces to be allowed to target Russian military logistic targets deep inside Russia using Storm Shadow missiles but has so far been frustrated in his efforts. The US also needs to give permission for the missiles to be used inside Russia. Rutte, when asked whether he would support such use, said that legally, Ukraine is allowed to use its weapons if they can hit targets in Russia that present a threat to Ukraine, but the decision was not up to him. \"That is up to the individual allies to decide how weapons they deliver into Ukraine can be used,\" he said. There is support in Whitehall for lifting the restrictions on the use of the Storm Shadow missiles but the government does not want to go it alone. The US has yet to give the green light and Germany is also opposed. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he would consider the move an escalation and there is concern among Nato countries about risking a Kremlin response. Ukraine had hoped a planned summit later this week in Ramstein, Germany, which was set to bring the country's biggest military backers together, would yield movement on the use of long-range missiles. But that summit has been delayed because US President Joe Biden is unable to attend while he oversees the emergency response to Hurricane Milton, which has caused widespread damage in Florida. Russia has made modest but strategically important gains on the battlefield in recent weeks, though a decisive breakthrough from either side remains elusive. Zelensky is keenly aware that US support for Ukraine may cool if Trump returns to the White House, which would leave Ukraine more dependent on European allies like the UK. That could test the West's stamina as the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion approaches, with growing questions around war fatigue and the West\u2019s long-term support. Rutte, when asked his concerns about a potential Trump presidency, told the BBC that the former president is \"fully aware of the fact that for the US to stay safe, that Nato membership... is crucial\".\n\nNato chief Mark Rutte was accompanied by Foreign Secretary David Lammy ahead of Downing Street talks\n\nThe UK has contributed \u00a312.8bn to Ukraine in military and other aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and more than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have temporarily settled in the UK. Since taking office, the prime minister has continued the policy of the previous Conservative government in offering strong financial and diplomatic support for Ukraine's war effort. It is the second time Zelensky has visited Downing Street since Sir Keir was elected prime minister. In July, the Ukrainian president became the first foreign leader to be hosted at No 10 since the change of government. While Sir Keir was still leader of the opposition, he also met Zelensky in Ukraine in February, and held talks with him at a Nato summit in July. That meeting of Nato countries saw the bloc promise Ukraine an \"irreversible path\" to membership, something the Ukrainian government considers vital for its security.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Aycliffe Quarry has taken action to reduce gas emissions, the Environment Agency said\n\nA \"rotten egg\" smell has persisted for more than a year - to the detriment of nearby householders - despite assurances the emissions believed to be responsible had been reduced. People living near the Aycliffe Quarry landfill site in County Durham said, last week, the odour was \"off the charts\" and \"turned their stomachs\". The quarry was identified by the Environment Agency (EA) as being the source of the \"stench\" last year, but the owner of the site has denied it is responsible for the latest problem. The EA said it was committed to ensuring any necessary action was taken to resolve the issue.\n\nThe quarry's owner said it had recorded an odour from a biogas facility on the nearby Aycliffe Industrial Estate. But the EA said smells from that site had not been picked up around areas of housing. Liz Brown, who lives three miles from the quarry, said the smell last week was so bad she woke with a \"bad head\". Another resident, Emma Eyre, said the smell was \"absolutely vile\". \"I live in Harrowgate Hill, and smell it most nights,\" she said. \"It turns my stomach. The stench stays in your house for days.\"\n\nAn interim report from an odour monitoring unit set up in the village of Brafferton was due at the end of September\n\nKatie Louise, who lives in nearby Brafferton village, said the smell had been constant since last September, and was affecting her, and other residents', mental health. She said her teenage daughter had asked if she smelt like a bin. \"It breaks my heart,\" Ms Louise said.\n\nThe EA is investigating Aycliffe Quarry, which is owned by the Ashcourt Group, after issuing an enforcement notice in February. It installed an odour monitoring unit in Brafferton in June. Interim results, due to be published at the end of September, were \"being compiled and will be issued as soon as possible\", the EA said.\n\nAshcourt said there had been \"odour emanating from a biogas facility on the nearby industrial estate at Newton Aycliffe\". \"We have recorded this in our ongoing monitoring checks,\" it added. It also said the wind direction did not match the complaints - but did not provide evidence.\n\nBio Capital, which runs Warrens Emerald Biogas waste treatment plant on the industrial estate, said it operated \"fully in accordance with the permits and environmental regulations set by the authorities\". It said it took complaints \"very seriously\", but pointed out \"other potential sources of odour in the vicinity, such as the nearby quarry\".\n\nThe EA said it was regularly assessing the quarry, which continued to implement measures to reduce gas emissions. \"We will consider appropriate enforcement action if necessary,\" a spokesperson said.",
    "Flames rise from a residential building in Russia after a drone attack from Ukraine\n\nRussia and Ukraine have carried out their largest drone attacks against each other since the start of the war. Russia's defence ministry said it intercepted 84 Ukrainian drones over six regions, including some approaching Moscow, which forced flights to be diverted from three of the capital's major airports. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 145 drones towards every part of the country on Saturday night, with most shot down. The barrages come amid expectations that US president-elect Donald Trump may put pressure on both sides to end the conflict.\n\nUkraine's attempted strike on Moscow was also its biggest attack on the capital since the war began, and was described as \"massive\" by the region's governor. Most of the drones were downed in the Ramenskoye, Kolomna and Domodedovo districts, officials said. In Ramenskoye, south-west of Moscow, five people were injured and four houses caught fire due to falling debris, the Russian Ministry of Defense said. It added that 34 drones had been shot down over the town. In September, a woman was killed in a drone attack that hit Ramenskoye. In May last year, two drones were destroyed near the Kremlin in central Moscow and there were several drone attacks on the Moscow City business district. In Ukraine, at least two people were injured after a drone hit the Odesa region. Images showed flames rising from some buildings, as well as aftermath damage. The Ukrainian air force said 62 of Russia's Iranian-made drones were shot down, while 67 were \"lost\". A further 10 left Ukraine's airspace heading back towards Russia, as well as neighbouring Belarus and Moldova, it added. Further strikes were reported overnight into Monday, with Russia saying it had destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones near the regions of Kursk and Belgorod. Meanwhile, five people were killed in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, following an air attack that left residential buildings on fire, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. He said a 45-year-old woman had also been injured and was in hospital.\n\nIt comes as Russian troops reportedly made their largest territorial gains in October since March 2022, according to analysis of Institute for the Study of War data by the AFP news agency. However, Sir Tony Radakin, the UK's chief of defence staff, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Russia had suffered its worst month for casualties since the start of the war. Russian forces suffered an average of about 1,500 dead and injured \"every single day\" in October, he said. There has been intense speculation about how Trump will approach the conflict since his election win in the US. The president-elect regularly said in his election campaign that he could end the war \"in a day\", but has not offered details on how he would do that. A former adviser to Trump, Bryan Lanza, told the BBC that the incoming administration would focus on achieving peace rather than enabling Ukraine to gain back territory from Russia. In response, a spokesperson for Trump distanced the president-elect from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza \"does not speak for him\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke via state media on Sunday of \"positive\" signals from the incoming US administration. He claimed that Trump spoke during his election campaign about wanting peace and not a desire to inflict defeat on Russia. Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky since his election win, a source telling the BBC that the conversation lasted \"about half an hour\". Zelensky has previously warned against conceding land to Russia and has said that without US aid, Ukraine would lose the war. In his regular evening address to Ukrainians on Sunday, Zelensky said \"the only way to secure a lasting peace\" is for strength and diplomacy to work hand in hand.",

I'd rather be happy than have all those benefits of being a professional rugby player.\u2019\u2019 He now manages a gym and works as a fitness coach, and hopes to see more support put in place for players. \"It\u2019s putting a space for those conversations to take place and the people of power within rugby saying 'you're struggling, what can we do to help?' \u2018\u2019It's the culture and understanding the individual and what they need.\u2019\u2019\n\nFellow Ospreys player Lloyd Ashley (left), is also working to change the way that professional rugby teams and players approach mental health\n\nAnother former Ospreys player, Lloyd Ashley, has been appointed lead for mental health and wellbeing by trade body the Welsh Rugby Players Association, external. \u2018\u2019Just generally as a society we need to find it easier to check in on each other,\" he said. Ashley hopes lessons learnt in rugby will filter through to other sports and also general society. \u2018\u2019The fact that we don't just say when somebody says to us 'how are you?', we don't just go, \u2018yeah good, you?\u2019, without even thinking about it,\" he said. \u2018\u2019I hope that trickles into everybody's lives because it's important that we have spaces where we feel safe enough to be honest.\"\n\nInternational player Dan Lydiate believes things have changed for the better since his debut for Wales in 2009. \u2018\u2019I think we're talking about mental health more,\" said the 36-year-old Grand Slam winner. \"There's more of an awareness of what's going on in people's lives which is a positive move.\u2019\u2019 After his father died two years ago, he said rugby was a lifeline. \u2018\u2019The only thing that was normal for me was to just get back into rugby and play the following week,\" he added. \u2018\u2019I miss him now.

    "Coco Gauff did not get out of the group stage on her previous two singles appearances at the WTA Finals\n\nCoco Gauff continued her stellar end to the season with victory over world number one Aryna Sabalenka to set up a WTA Finals showpiece against Zheng Qinwen. American Gauff had already notched a rare win over Iga Swiatek in the group stage and capitalised on an increasingly wayward performance from Sabalenka. Gauff beat the Australia and US Open champion 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to reach the final of the season-ending tournament for the first time. The 20-year-old has lost just two of her 14 matches since her US Open title defence ended in the fourth round in September. She will face another first-time finalist in Olympic champion Zheng, who beat Wimbledon winner Barbora Krejcikova 6-3 7-5. \"She's playing great. Playing confident tennis will help me and give me the best shot at winning,\" Gauff said. \"Year-end, I consider it as a plus, and even being here is a reward for the season I've had.\" This year's tournament has record prize money of \u00a312m.\n\nSabalenka secured the year-end world number one ranking this week after a stellar season, but she was frustrated, error-prone and annoyed throughout against Gauff. Her forehand faltered - such a crucial component of her game - with 16 unforced errors coming off it in the first set. She and Gauff traded breaks early on but Gauff was serene on serve, able to extend the rally in the knowledge that Sabalenka would eventually hit an error. Despite the chaos, Sabalenka broke for a 6-5 lead and served for the set, but a netted backhand sent it to a tie-break, which Gauff dominated. After a lengthy bathroom break, Sabalenka started the second set better but another backhand miss hurried Gauff to an early break. Gauff reeled off four games in a row for a 4-1 lead before Sabalenka eventually retrieved one of the breaks - but she needed eight break points to do that after a mammoth Gauff service game. Given the erratic nature of the match, a break of the Sabalenka serve in the next game felt inevitable, and it was - as was Gauff being broken when she served for the match at 5-2. But Sabalenka could not delay the inevitable even on her serve, and a final netted backhand - her 37th unforced error of the night - secured victory for Gauff.\n\nZheng Qinwen has hit 406 aces this year - more than any other player on the WTA Tour\n\nCrowds have been mixed at the tournament but Zheng has been a consistent draw in Saudi Arabia, with a large number of Chinese fans cheering her on against Krejcikova. Her game is simple: a big serve, followed up by an equally thumping groundstroke, which initially worked to great effect against Krejcikova. She moved well around the court, bullying Krejcikova out of rallies and racing to a set and a break lead before the Czech took advantage of a dip in form to force things back on serve. Zheng grew increasingly frustrated - not helped by her service game twice being held up by a crying baby - and her shots grew wilder, but she kept herself in touching distance of Krejcikova. A thunderous backhand return of serve gave Zheng break point at 5-5, and she duly took it on a long Krejcikova forehand to serve for the match. Although Krejcikova again pushed her, with Zheng having to fend off another break point, she ultimately claimed a straight-set win as the Czech went wide with a forehand. \"It feels so special - to be in the final feels unbelievable,\" the 22-year-old said. \"It was a hard match for me but it shows I am mentally strong in that moment.\"",

Video shows angry crowd throwing objects at the King of Spain\n\nThe king and queen of Spain have been pelted with mud and other objects by angry protesters during a visit to flood-hit Valencia. Shouts of \"murderer\" and \"shame\" were directed at the royal couple as they walked through the town of Paiporta - one of the worst-affected in the region. Objects were also thrown at Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who was quickly evacuated. More than 200 people were killed in the floods, the worst in Spain for decades. Emergency workers are continuing to comb through underground car parks and tunnels in the hope of finding survivors and recovering bodies.\n\nThere has been anger at a perceived lack of warning and insufficient support from authorities after the floods. Footage showed King Felipe VI making his way down a pedestrian street, before his bodyguards and police were suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of protesters, hurling insults and screaming.\n\nKing Felipe was heckled by angry residents during the visit to Paiporta\n\nThey struggled to maintain a protective ring around the monarch, as some of the protesters threw mud and objects. The king engaged with several, even embracing them. Images showed mud on the faces and clothes of the king, Queen Letizia and their entourage, who held umbrellas over the monarch as they departed.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Queen Letizia in tears on visit to flood-hit Valencia\n\nPrime Minister S\u00e1nchez and the head of Valencian regional government, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, joined the royal couple on the visit, but were swiftly evacuated as the crowd grew increasingly hostile. Spanish media reports that objects were hurled at S\u00e1nchez, while footage verified by the BBC appears to show stones being thrown at his car as he was driven away. After he left, the crowd chanted: \"Where is S\u00e1nchez?\" \u201cI\u2019m just 16,\u201d one boy, Pau, told the BBC through tears. \u201cWe\u2019re helping \u2013 and the leaders do nothing. People are still dying. I can\u2019t stand this anymore.\u201d Another woman said: \u201cThey left us to die. We\u2019ve lost everything: our businesses, our homes, our dreams.\u201d The civil guard and mounted officers were later seen attempting to disperse the angry crowd. The royal entourage had intended to travel on to Chiva, another town in the Valencia province badly impacted by the flooding, but that visit has since been postponed. The king later said he understood the \"anger and frustration\" of the protestors in a video posted on the royal household's Instagram account.\n\nMore than 60 deaths have so far been reported in the town of Paiporta\n\nThe mayor of Paiporta, Maribel Albalat, told the BBC she was shocked by the violence, but that she understood \"the frustration and desperation of the people\". Juan Bordera, a member of the Valencian parliament, called the king's visit \"a very bad decision\". Authorities \u201cdidn\u2019t listen to any warnings,\u201d Mr Bordera told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s logical that the people are angry, it\u2019s logical that the people didn\u2019t understand why this visit is so urgent,\u201d he added. On Saturday, S\u00e1nchez ordered 10,000 more troops, police officers and civil guards to the area. He said the deployment was Spain's largest in peacetime. But he added that he was aware the response was \"not enough\" and acknowledged \"severe problems and shortages\". The flooding began on Tuesday, following a period of intense rainfall. Floodwaters quickly caused bridges to collapse and enveloped towns in thick mud. Many communities were cut off, left without access to water, food, electricity and other basic services.\n\nVolunteer clean-up efforts have seen thousands of people with mops, buckets and brooms march to the areas most affected\n\nOn Sunday, the death toll from the flooding rose to 217, with many more feared missing. Almost all of the deaths confirmed so far have been in the Valencia region on the Mediterranean coast. Some areas have been particularly devastated. Authorities in Paiporta, the town visited today by the royal delegation, have reported at least 62 deaths. Spain's meteorological agency AEMET issued its highest level of alert on Sunday for parts of southern Valencia - including the cities of Alzira, Cullera and Gandia. Intense storms forecast to pass the area will not be on the scale of Tuesday's, the agency said, with 90mm (3.45 inches) of rainfall expected.\n\nAre you in the Valencia region?

    "The simple exam tweaks that can completely change lives\n\nHannah says access to special arrangements during exam season \"utterly shifted\" her school life\n\nFrom extra time to sitting exams in smaller classrooms, more changes than ever are being made to exams to support students. Figures released on Thursday by exams regulator Ofqual, external reveal 625,000 adjustments were made to GCSE, AS and A-level exams in England in the past year. It has left many schools and colleges struggling to cope with the logistical hurdles required to make all the adjustments. Some have had to hire external exam halls because their own buildings have reached capacity, while others are hiring more invigilators to monitor exams - all of which comes at an extra cost.\n\nFor Hannah, 17, a few \"simple\" tweaks to her exam experience made a significant difference. When Hannah began sitting exams at school, at the age of 10, she started to experience panic attacks and \"crippling anxiety\". On several occasions, teachers had to take her out of the exam hall to calm her down and regulate her breathing. She rarely finished her exams, and the traumatic experience took such a toll on her mental health that she was eventually admitted to CAMHS, the NHS service which supports children and young people with emotional, behavioural, and mental health challenges. But when she was later diagnosed with dyslexia, Hannah's school made a number of changes to her exam set-up. \"It completely and utterly shifted my high school experience,\" she says.\n\nHannah is one of many thousands of students in England granted access arrangements when she sit exams.

That figure is a 12.3% rise on the year before. In the same period, the number of students sitting exams only rose by 5.6%. In the past three years, the total number of approved access arrangements has risen by 39.6%.\n\nFor students to be granted exam access arrangements, schools and colleges have to submit detailed evidence to qualified assessors. They will then sit with each student to determine whether they are entitled to extra help - and what adjustments they require. Some students are granted one adjustment, while others qualify for many.\n\nEducational psychologist Dr Patricia Britto says the rise of approved requests is partly due to a spike in the number of children being diagnosed with neurodiverse needs, such as ADHD and autism. \"We also have better tools now than we've ever done in being able to identify the different needs that children have,\" she says. But Dr Britto adds there are still more children who need extra help in lessons and exams to ensure they can \"thrive rather than survive\" at school.\n\nMartin Stables, examination assessment and engagement lead at Leeds City College, says access arrangements are tailored to each student to ensure exams replicate the way they learn in the classroom. More than 3,900 students - 38% of the total college population at Leeds City - have at least one form of bespoke exam arrangements.\n\nLeeds City College has to hire a sports hall in a leisure centre as there is not enough space on campus to run exams\n\nAnd while the \"holistic approach\" allows students to perform better in exams, Mr Stables says a lot of planning is needed to make sure every exam runs smoothly. In the past, the college has had to hire out a community centre to fulfil extra space requirements on exam days. This year, it was a sports hall at a nearby leisure centre. \"The cost of all that is having to be swallowed by the college itself,\" says Mr Stables. \"Without these additional spaces, it would nigh-on impossible given the level of access arrangements that we have.\" In addition, every member of college staff has been trained to invigilate exams due to the surge in the number of students requiring extra support. Last year, the college CEO even stepped in to invigilate an exam: \"It's everyone mucking in.\"\n\nBarry Wheller, an independent exams access arrangements assessor, says funding and staffing problems are also becoming a major issue for schools. With more students needing rest breaks and being given permission to sit exams in smaller rooms, schools are increasingly having to hire additional exam invigilators. \"Schools have to swallow this extra cost.\" He also cites the price of assistive technology, such as read and write software and exam reader pens, which cost hundreds of pounds each.\n\nFor all the difficulties schools and colleges face in accommodating access arrangements, Hannah says the additional support can \"completely change people's lives\". She cites her dad, who left school with no qualifications because he \"didn't get the help he needed\", and compares it with her experience. \"I think we're extremely privileged to have people who can recognise these issues, but the grades you get in your education do determine what happens in your career.\"",

    "Rabbi who went missing in UAE was murdered, Israel says\n\nIsrael says a rabbi who went missing in the United Arab Emirates has been murdered, and have vowed to track down his killers. \u201cThe murder of Zvi Kogan is a criminal antisemitic terrorist incident. The State of Israel will act in all of its abilities to bring to justice the criminals responsible for his death,\u201d the PM\u2019s office said following news on Sunday that the rabbi's body had been found. Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder, the UAE's interior ministry confirmed on Sunday evening. Rabbi Kogan, an envoy of the orthodox Jewish organisation Chabad Lubavitch, had been missing in Dubai since Thursday sparking a investigation from Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and UAE authorities.\n\nIsraeli officials have been in contact with the family of the Israeli-Moldovan national, since he went missing, the Israeli statement continued. The recovery of Zvi Kogan's body comes after his abandoned car was found an hour's drive away from his home. Mossad investigators are working to identify those responsible for the rabbi's death. Chabad is a religious foundation that seeks to build links with non-affiliated and secular Jews or other sects of Judaism. The group's branch in the UAE supports thousands of Jewish visitors and residents, according to its website, external. Rabbi Kogan, 28, worked with other Chabad emissaries \"in establishing and expanding Jewish life in the Emirates\", the organisation says, external. He also managed a kosher supermarket in Dubai. Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, chairman of Chabad Lubavitch said: \"We trust that the UAE will work with the countries in the region to bring the perpetrators to justice, and hold all those involved accountable for this act of sheer evil.\" The Israeli government's travel advisory service warns citizens to only travel to the UAE for \"essential reasons\", as they say there is \"terrorist activity\" in the UAE, which constitutes \"a real risk to Israelis who are staying/visiting in the country\".

    "Trapped in cars and garages: Why Valencia floods proved so deadly\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Valencia floods: 'There is just mud everywhere'\n\nAs Spain reels from the flash floods which struck the south-east of the country this week, many are wondering why the death toll, which currently stands at over 200, is so high. Almost all of the deaths confirmed so far have been in the Valencia region on the Mediterranean coast. Some areas have been particularly devastated: the town of Paiporta, population 25,000, reported at least 62 deaths. Various factors, including drivers becoming trapped in their cars, poor planning by officials and extreme rainfall being exacerbated by climate change are all likely to have contributed.\n\nThe civil protection agency, overseen by the regional government, issued an emergency alert to the phones of people in and around the city of Valencia after 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday, by which time the flood water was swiftly rising in many areas and in some cases already wreaking havoc. A large number of those killed were on the roads, in many cases returning from work, when the flash floods struck. Video footage shows how a first wave of flood water washed through Paiporta as cars were still circulating. Although rainfall was heavier in other areas, such as Utiel and Chiva, Paiporta\u2019s geography, with a ravine running through its centre, made the impact of the flood particularly devastating. Mayor Maribel Albalat said that the town was ill-prepared in terms of planning, with many ground-floor flats. Six residents of an elderly care home died when the flood water washed into the building when they were still on the ground floor. She also suggested there was an element of complacency. \u201cIn Paiporta we don\u2019t tend to have floods and people aren\u2019t afraid,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen it rains people normally go down to their garages to get their cars out in case their garage is flooded,\u201d Ms Albalat said. That appears to have been the case in the neighbourhood of La Torre, on the outskirts of Valencia, where the bodies of seven people were recovered from the garage of a residential building. The A3 motorway connecting Valencia to Madrid was one of many roads where motorists were trapped as the water level rose, leaving them unsure whether it was safer to stay in the vehicle or not. \u201cThere are almost certainly more people who have died because the water washed people away who had got out of their cars,\u201d one survivor told the Telecinco TV channel. Another survivor said the water had been up to his chest. An eye-witness described seeing one driver who had got out of his car who had strapped himself to a lamppost with his belt, to stop himself from being washed away. It is unknown whether he survived. The mayor of Chiva, Amparo Fort, warned on Thursday that nearby there were still \u201chundreds of cars turned upside down and they will surely have people inside them\u201d. On Thursday morning, the Guardia Civil shared advice on how to escape from a car during a flood on social media, external. People caught in floods are advised to try and escape though their cars' windows and windscreen.\n\nOther factors also appear to help explain why Valencia was so devastated by the weather event. Much of the area most heavily affected, in and surrounding the country\u2019s third-largest city, is densely populated. A lack of rainfall throughout the rest of the year has left the ground in many areas of eastern and southern Spain unable to absorb rainwater efficiently. Pablo Aznar, a researcher at the Socio-Economic Observatory of Floods and Droughts (Obsis), warned that much of the area affected had undergone what he described as \u201cuntrammelled development\u201d, with many areas covered in impermeable materials, which \u201cincreases the danger posed by these events\u201d. The warming climate is also likely to have contributed to the severity of the floods. In a preliminary report, World Weather Attribution (WWA), a group of international scientists who investigate global warming\u2019s role in extreme weather, found that the rainfall which struck Spain was 12% heavier due to climate change and that the weather event experienced was twice as likely.",
    "A British lawyer has died after a suspected methanol poisoning that is thought to have killed four others in Laos, south-east Asia. Simone White, 28, from Orpington, south-east London, was among a number of people taken to hospital following the incident in the tourist town of Vang Vieng. In a statement, the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was supporting her family. Earlier, Bianca Jones, 19, from Australia, was confirmed to have died while the US State Department said an American had died. Two Danish women aged 19 and 20 also died last week, Danish authorities said.\n\nNews reports and testimonies on social media from other tourists have suggested they may have consumed drinks laced with methanol, a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol. Many of the victims were staying at the Nana Backpacker Hostel with staff being told that guests had fallen ill after they failed to check out on 13 November. Ms White was a lawyer with global law firm Squire Patton Boggs, whose work involved general commercial matters, contentious and non-contentious intellectual property law issues according to the firm's website. Vang Vieng is a small, riverside town in central Laos, about two hours north of the capital Vientiane. It is a hub for backpackers travelling across south-east Asia. It's home to the Banana Pancake Trail - a popular backpacking route spanning Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nMs Jones' friend Holly Bowles, who is also Australian, is in hospital on life support, according to Australian media reports. New Zealand's foreign ministry told local media on Thursday that one of its citizens was also unwell from suspected methanol poisoning. The Netherlands' foreign affairs ministry has said a Dutch tourist was sent to the hospital and remains in a stable condition. It is unclear how many others have fallen ill.\n\nThe US State Department has said it is \"closely monitoring\" the situation with regards to the American victim and it was up to local authorities to determine the cause of death. Australian, external, New Zealand, external, and UK, external authorities have each warned their citizens to be careful of methanol poisoning when consuming alcohol in Laos.\n\nMethanol is a colourless liquid that tastes similar to alcohol. Drinking a relatively small amount can be lethal. It is absorbed in the gut within minutes and then gets into the bloodstream. As the body attempts to clear methanol - breaking it down or metabolising it in the liver - an enzyme converts it to formaldehyde and formic acid. Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds says this has major consequences, affecting breathing and attacking the nerves. Partial or complete blindness from methanol poisoning is common, and if left untreated, it can lead to a coma and death. Poisoning can be treated using alcohol (ethanol) to outcompete the methanol metabolism. But this has to be done quickly.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?",
    "The girl who went to buy cornflakes and never came home\n\nLindsay Rimer liked Nirvana, the Prodigy and had dreams of one day studying at university\n\nOn a rainy November night in 1994, Lindsay Rimer walked the short route from her home to a local shop to buy breakfast cereal. The 13-year-old's body was discovered weighed down in a nearby canal months later. In her pocket, the exact change from the cornflakes she had bought. Her killer has never been caught. Senior detectives are not usually immediately alerted to a missing teenager. On the day the alarm was raised Tony Whittle was chatting with colleague Graham Sunderland. The conversation turned to the cases they were working on, with Graham saying the force received a call that morning about a young girl who had not turned up for her daily paper round. Her parents were frantic because it appeared she had not been home all night.\n\nWhether it was professional judgement or gut feeling, the men agreed there was something they could not put their finger on that left them concerned. Then a detective superintendent in the murder squad, Tony was based in Bradford where it was not too unusual for teenagers to disappear overnight before re-emerging the next day. But this was Hebden Bridge. Eight miles (12km) outside of Halifax in West Yorkshire, a hippie-spirited town surrounded by rolling hills and stone bridges. The definition of a community where everyone knows everyone. Although no-one in Lindsay Rimer's family knew it yet, their lives had changed forever.\n\nGeri and Gordon Rimer make an appeal to the public for help in finding their missing daughter\n\n\"We were just a normal family before that night. Then it all exploded,\" recalls Kate, Lindsay\u2019s elder sister who was 20 when she disappeared. One of three girls, Kate was a new mum and living near the family home on Cambridge Street. Lindsay would often come for a sleepover. Having realised there were no cornflakes for breakfast the next day, at 22:00 GMT on 7 November Lindsay had walked less than a mile to the Spar on Crown Street. When she left the house, her dad was on the phone so Lindsay called at the nearby Trades Club where her mum was meeting friends and got some money from her so she could buy the cereal. After her mum returned later, Lindsay's parents went to bed assuming their daughter had come home and gone straight up to her attic room. But the next morning they were called by the newsagents where Lindsay worked to say she had not turned up. \"Mum and dad realised her paper delivery bag was still in the kitchen along with her school money. They ran upstairs and realised she hadn't slept in her bed. \u201cThey knew straight away something had happened,\" Kate says.\n\nLindsay did not turn up for her paper round at Forbuoys Newsagents, her brightly coloured bag hung up with the coats at home\n\nGraham (left) and Tony were at the forefront of police efforts to solve the case. In this media appeal Lindsay's dad Gordon (right) speaks to the press\n\nGrainy CCTV footage from the shop captured Lindsay leaving at 22:22 GMT. She was spotted moments later by two bus passengers as she leant against a wall near to the town\u2019s Memorial Garden. That was the last confirmed sighting of her alive. In the early days of her disappearance, police and the community joined forces and combed the area, hoping to bring the teenager home. Three close friends of Geri and Gordon moved in with the family. Together, they would spend nights brainstorming, writing down potential leads or information on a flip chart - anything that could help find Lindsay. A week into the search and Kate, who describes being \"plucked from normality into a world of crime and press,\" played the role of her sister in a televised reconstruction. It was hoped tracing her last movements would jog people's memories. Kate remembers: \"I was insistent I wanted to take part. She was my build and we looked similar. I felt it was the least I could do to try and find her.\" \"I look back at photos of myself at the time and the reconstruction and I look so young. I don't recognise myself but I recognise the terror in my face,\" she adds.\n\nKate Rimer, pictured in 1994, was determined to take part in the reconstruction of her sister's last known movements\n\nAs the investigation wore on Kate says she remembers when officers, growing increasingly desperate for a breakthrough, searched the home of every man in the town. There were rumours of sightings in other parts of the country. One man told police he had seen Lindsay being dragged into a car and had followed it to a nearby reservoir but his claims were disproved. Tony reflects: \"All we had was this CCTV picture of her in her big baggy jumper and jeans and that was it.\" \"There were people around at the time and had she been dragged into a vehicle kicking and screaming, someone would have seen or heard.\"\n\nDetectives believe Lindsay may have been killed by someone she knew\n\nThe lack of sightings led detectives to believe Lindsay had got into a vehicle with someone she knew. She was described as an \"intelligent, cautious girl\" who would not have gone off with a stranger. The investigation gained national attention, generating a sense of fear about how a schoolgirl could vanish in a place like Hebden Bridge. An offender profile drawn up by a psychiatrist suggested the likely suspect would be someone who could drive, probably aged 17 to early 20s, and perhaps someone Lindsay would be attracted to. Could it be someone she had met recently or maybe an older brother of someone she knew?\n\nThere were hopes of a breakthrough after identifying the driver of a stolen Honda Civic\n\nSeveral weeks into the inquiry and there was hope of a breakthrough. Exhausted detective Tony had been persuaded to take his first day off in weeks when he received a call to say officers had tracked down the driver of a stolen red Honda Civic. The vehicle had been spotted around the town when Lindsay disappeared. It was thought the driver had attempted to talk to schoolgirls. Tony remembers: \"I thought, 'right, that's our guy, let's get him in'.\" However, it turned out the man had an alibi and was ruled out. \"He was actually being spoken to by a police officer miles away at about the time Lindsay would have left the shop,\" he adds. As the months wore on, and with the absence of any concrete leads, the inquiry was beginning to wind down.\n\nThe schoolgirl's body was found at Rawden Mill Lock\n\nThen in April 1995, Lindsay's body was found a mile out of the town centre in the Rochdale Canal by two council workers clearing debris from the waterway. Kate says: \"I remember it clearly. I was sat in the park watching my daughter play. \u201cMy dad walked down and sat next to me. He said they'd found a body and we needed to go back to the house. \"It wasn't a shock because after so long we weren't expecting her to come home. But it was just deeply sad.\" Lindsay had been strangled - likely killed on the night she vanished and her body dumped. The arms of her jumper had been tied together in a sling with a stone used to weigh her down. There was no suggestion of a sexual assault. Being submerged in the water for so long had erased any chance of forensic clues that might help police.\n\nJuliet (left) and Kate Rimer say their family has been left \"broken\" by the murder of their sister\n\nHundreds of witness statements were taken. Officers spoke to thousands of people, examined hundreds of vehicles and made repeated appeals, but no progress was made. Over the years the case has remained open and there have been moments where a breakthrough appeared within touching distance. In April 2016, police believed that scientific advances had enabled them to create a DNA profile which may lead them back to the killer. A 63-year-old man was arrested in November of that year with a 68-year-old from Bradford arrested in April 2017. Both were later released without charge. Three decades on, Lindsay's younger sister Juliet reflects on how she has no living memory of her sibling. A baby when she disappeared, Juliet has grown up knowing Lindsay to exist only in the context of murder and death. She talks about a childhood where her family were in a \"perpetual cycle of grief\". \"I don't think there was one particular instance where I found out I had a sister that was killed. \"You can't have a conversation with your young child about murder so it was something I pieced together over the years.\" The shadow of Lindsay's murder still looms across Hebden Bridge and weighs heavily on the minds of both former and current officers. Graham, who was a detective inspector on the investigation, says he thinks about the case often and it was the only one in his career that officers hadn't solved.\n\nThe original case detectives, Tony Whittle and Graham Sunderland, who are now retired, say they still believe Lindsay's killer can be found\n\nAlthough now retired, he is desperate for the case to be solved: \"We need to know what happened to Lindsay. No matter how insignificant, if someone knows something, for heaven's sake come forward.\" \"It's a little girl I've never met and yet I know really well,\" he adds.\n\u2022 None 'Now's the time to talk over murdered schoolgirl' The detective now heading up the inquiry says police are still committed to finding the killer and getting justice for the Rimers. Det Ch Insp James Entwistle says: \"Loyalties change around people who know things, science moves on. There is always an opportunity and always a drive because this is a relentless pursuit for the truth.\" The wounds of not knowing remain unhealed for Lindsay\u2019s family. Kate describes her parents as \"broken\" with the whole family \"exhausted by grief\". They have created a memory box of their sister. They talk about a young teenager who had a love of fashion, was into Nirvana and the Prodigy and was keen to go to university. But for self-preservation Kate and Juliet can't focus too much on what Lindsay's life may have been like. \"For our own wellbeing, we cannot go there. \u201cIt's too painful to think about what she would be doing and what she's missed out on.\" The family\u2019s only way of finding peace is to find the killer. Kate says: \"If you've experienced a death in the family you're allowed to move on from it. \u201cYou can forge a life where you encompass grief, but it doesn't overwhelm it. \"But we're stuck in this overwhelm all the time because we don't have closure. \u201cWe can only move on when we know who is responsible for killing our sister.\"\n\u2022 None Anyone affected by the issues raised in this piece can access help and support via the BBC Action Line.",
    "Fema official ordered storm crews not to help Trump voters\n\nHurricane Milton hit Florida last month, two weeks after Hurricane Helene\n\nA Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) supervisor has been fired for telling staff helping hurricane survivors to skip houses displaying signs supporting Donald Trump. The agency's head, Deanne Criswell, described the supervisor's actions as \"reprehensible\", saying Fema takes its mission \"to help everyone before, during and after disasters seriously\u201d.

'I love it!' - Guardiola on challenge ahead after defeat by Sporting\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has come out fighting as he contemplates his side's worst sequence of results since 2018. The 4-1 Champions League defeat by Sporting in Lisbon was City\u2019s third loss in a row. Only once during Guardiola\u2019s reign have City lost three times in a row in a single season. Although he rejected skipper Bernardo Silva\u2019s post-match assertion that the club is currently in a \"dark place\", Guardiola also accepted after a defeat of this size, words are largely meaningless. However, he is not backing away from the challenge. \"We knew it would be a tough season at the start,\" he said. \"I like it. I love it. I want to face it and lift my players. \"I won\u2019t give up, that\u2019s for sure.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Premier League should be fun - Amorim on Manchester United challenge\n\nFew will have sympathy with City over their current injury issues. Guardiola\u2019s decision to hand a first start to FA Youth Cup-winning skipper Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, a day after his 19th birthday and less than a week after his senior debut, underlined the issues he is dealing with in central defence. Neither John Stones nor Ruben Dias made the trip, while Nathan Ake remained on the substitutes' bench throughout. Rico Lewis played at right-back in the absence of skipper Kyle Walker, and Kevin de Bruyne was only risked for the final six minutes. Defensive midfielder Rodri is, of course, out for the season. Guardiola says the current experience feels like his debut campaign in 2016-17, when City struggled for consistency and were fifth after a 4-0 defeat at Everton in January before embarking on a run of one loss in 17 league games, which eventually led them to finish in third spot. \"It happened in my first year,\" he said. \"Sometimes it does. \"I have to try to find an explanation but sometimes it's just football so you have to accept it. Sport is that. Life is that. Sometimes we have bad moments but we face the reality. \"Everyone has to try to be better and we will find it. We are still alive in all competitions and we continue.\"\n\nCity have another tough away trip to Brighton on Saturday. It is not entirely clear who Guardiola will have available but he will be desperate to avoid a fourth straight reverse. For Silva, it is a tough time. \"It's difficult to find the reasons why what is happening to us now,\" he said. \"In seven and a half seasons, I don't remember three in a row. \"We're in a dark place. Everything looks to be going the wrong way. \"The good thing is even though we lost three games we're in good positions in the Premier League and Champions League. We're still fighting for everything, but we need to do better. It's just not good enough at the minute.\" City are second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Liverpool but four clear of third-placed Nottingham Forest and sixth in the expanded Champions League table. However, they are likely to drop outside the top eight when the second set of matches in the fourth round of fixtures are played. Nevertheless, at least they are competing, unlike Manchester United, which Guardiola pointed out when he was asked about the prospect of coming up against Ruben Amorim when he moves in at Old Trafford next week. \"Yes, he will be United manager and we will face him two times in the Premier League and maybe the FA Cup.

Tata was one of India's most internationally recognised business leaders. The Tata Group is one of India's largest companies, with annual revenues in excess of $100bn (\u00a376.5bn). In a statement announcing Tata's death, the current chairman of Tata Sons described him as a \"truly uncommon leader\".\n\nNatarajan Chandrasekaran added: \"On behalf of the entire Tata family, I extend our deepest condolences to his loved ones. \"His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed.\" During his tenure as chairman of the Tata Group, the conglomerate made several high-profile acquisitions, including the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, UK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover, and Tetley, the world's second-largest tea company. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said in tribute that Tata was a \"titan of the business world\" who \"played a huge role in shaping British industry\". A profile published in the Economist magazine in 2011 called Tata a \"titan\", crediting him with transforming the family group into \"a global powerhouse\". \"He owns less than 1% of the group that bears his family name. But he is a titan nonetheless: the most powerful businessman in India and one of the most influential in the world,\" the magazine said. In 2012, he retired as chairman of the group and was appointed chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, the group's holding company. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Tata as a \"visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being\". Paying tribute on X, formerly known as Twitter, Modi recounted \"countless interactions\" with Tata and said he was \"extremely pained\" by his death. Tata - whose body is lying at a cultural centre in Mumbai to allow people to pay their respects - is to receive a state funeral later on Thursday.\n\nTata was born in a traditional Parsi family in 1937. He studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University in the US. In 1962, he joined Tata Industries - the promoter company of the group - as an assistant and spent six months training at a company plant in Jamshedpur. From there, he went on to work at the Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Radio and Electronics (Nelco). In 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor. \"He [JRD Tata] was my greatest mentor... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,\" Tata later told an interviewer. In 2008, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. India's Ratan Tata: In his own words\n\nPeter Casey, author of The Story of Tata, described Tata as a \"modest, reserved and even shy man\" who had a \"stately calm\" about him and a \"fierce discipline\". He was drawn into a rare unsavoury controversy in 2016, when his successor as Tata Sons chairman, Cyrus Mistry, was ousted from the role, sparking a bitter management feud. Mistry died in a car crash in 2022. The business tycoon also had a lighter side to him. His love for fast cars and planes was well-known - the Tata group website describes these as some of his \"enduring passions\". Tata was also a scuba diving enthusiast, a hobby that fizzled with age \"as his ears could take the pressure no more\". He was also a dog lover and fondly remembered the many pets who gave him company over the decades. \"My love for dogs as pets is ever strong and will continue for as long as I live,\" the industrialist said in a 2021 interview. \"There is an indescribable sadness every time one of my pets passes away and I resolve I cannot go through another parting of that nature. And yet, two-three years down the road, my home becomes too empty and too quiet for me to live without them, so there is another dog that gets my affection and attention, just like the last one,\" he said. He was also often praised for his simplicity. In 2022, a video of him travelling in a Nano car - one of the world's cheapest cars, now mostly remembered as one of Tata's failed dreams - went viral on social media.\n\u2022 None From the archive: The men of steel with a softer side",
    "'The country is lost': Fear and uncertainty in Lebanon as Israel invades\n\nIsrael has been intensively striking Lebanon for the past week\n\nFor the past few days, there was a feeling in Lebanon that an Israeli ground invasion into the country\u2019s south was almost inevitable as Israel indicated its campaign against Hezbollah would not stop with the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, who, for three decades, was the face of the group. Now that this has been confirmed, with what the Israeli military describes as a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d operation, the fear is that this could be the start of something wider. History shows that it is easy for Israeli troops to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. \u201cThe country is lost,\u201d a Lebanese friend texted me. Another one wrote: \u201cIf you ask me what\u2019s coming, my answer is it will be very long and hard days are coming\u201d. A third said: \u201cWe just need to hope for the best.\u201d\n\nThere is a feeling that history is repeating itself, and uncertainty about what happens next. It remains unclear whether Hezbollah can still organise any significant and co-ordinated response. It continues to fire rockets at Israel, but not at the same intensity. Meanwhile, this is a country under pressure, struggling with the sheer number of casualties from Israeli air strikes and one million people who have already been displaced. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim group armed and financed by Iran, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others, but is more than just a militia in Lebanon. It is also a political party with representation in parliament, and a social movement, engrained in Lebanese society, with significant support. Powerful and influential, Hezbollah, which means Party of God, is often described as a state within a state in Lebanon. It has been weakened by two weeks of unrelenting Israeli air strikes and high-profile assassinations, but has not been defeated. In a defiant speech on Monday, the Hezbollah number two, Naim Qassem, said its fighters were ready to resist any Israeli invasion. Before this latest escalation, Hezbollah\u2019s armed wing, which includes a vast arsenal of weapons and thousands of battled-hardened fighters, was said to be stronger than the Lebanese army, and the country\u2019s authorities have little say - if any - over the group\u2019s actions. For almost a year, as Hezbollah carried out near-daily cross-border attacks on Israel, many outside its support base in Lebanon feared that this country, already struggling to recover from years of successive crises, was being dragged into a conflict that it has not chosen to fight. The economy has essentially collapsed, and political impasse means the country has been without a president for almost two years. Here, there are still memories of the last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, when parts of southern Lebanon and Dahieh, the group\u2019s base in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, were flattened. Hezbollah\u2019s rivals will not be disappointed to see a weakened group who, many say, is interested in defending its own interests - and those of its main supporter, Iran. Hezbollah is the most powerful group in the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance of factions across the Middle East supported by Iran that also includes the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq and Syria. Having a strong Hezbollah in Lebanon, right next to Israel, has always been vital for Iran, part of its deterrence against any Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities. Yesterday, outside a building in central Beirut hit by an Israeli strike, a resident told me: \u201cI\u2019m against Israel, who is killing us, but I\u2019m against Iran, who is killing us as well\u201d. This is, obviously, rejected by Hezbollah supporters. \u201cWe shed tears of blood over the [Israeli] strike against Nasrallah, may God grant him paradise\u2026 He\u2019s irreplaceable,\u201d one of them said, after being forced to flee Dahieh. \u201cWe don\u2019t fear [Israel]. We\u2019re still standing.\u201d",

    "Children as young as 10 can soon be jailed once again in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), after the government there lowered the age of criminal responsibility. Australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise it, from 10 to 14, in line with other developed countries and UN advice. Last year the NT became the first jurisdiction to lift the threshold to 12 years old, but the new Country Liberal Party (CLP) government elected in August has said a reversal is necessary to reduce youth crime rates. It has argued that returning the age to 10 will ultimately protect children - despite doctors, human rights organisations and Indigenous groups disputing that logic.\n\nThey cite evidence that the laws will not reduce crime and will disproportionately affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The NT already jails children at a rate 11 times higher than any other jurisdiction in the country, and almost all of them are Aboriginal, external. Many places across Australia have declared they are in the grips of a youth crime crisis, and a string of violent incidents this year have prompted a series of youth curfews in the NT city of Alice Springs.\n\nChief Minister Lia Finocchiaro said her government had been given a mandate after their landslide election victory, and that the change would allow courts to put young offenders through programmes designed to address the root causes of their crimes - which, according to statistics, are most commonly break-in and assault offences. \"We have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time,\" she told the parliament on Thursday. \"And we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear anymore.\" The NT government has also tightened bail rules, and introduced penalties for \"posting and boasting\" about crime on social media. \"We make no apologies for delivering on our commitments to reduce crime for all Territorians,\" Finocchiaro added. However, research both globally and in Australia has shown that incarcerating children makes them more likely to reoffend and often has dire impacts on their health, education, and employment. Earlier this year a report by the Australian Human Rights Commission - an independent federal agency - found policy across the nation was being driven \u201cby populist \u2018tough on crime\u2019 rhetoric\u201d and that governments should instead reinvest the money spent on jailing children into support services. Opposition Leader Selena Uibo - the first and only Aboriginal woman to head a major party in Australia - said it was a \"dark day\" for the territory. \"We know - because all of the evidence tells us this - that the earlier a child comes into contact with the criminal justice system, the more prolonged their involvement is likely to be,\" she said. \"We want to see children held accountable for bad behaviour but then supported to get on a better path.\" The change will come into effect at a later date that is yet to be confirmed.\n\nIndependent MP Yingiya Guyula has protested against the bill, calling it \"racist\"\n\nAs the NT parliament debated the bill this week, around 100 people gathered outside to protest, some carrying placards. One read, \"10-year-olds still have baby teeth\". Another said, \"What if it was your child?\". Independent MP Yingiya Guyula, a Yol\u014bu man from northeastern Arnhem Land, told the BBC it was a \u201cracist\u201d bill. \"It is just colonisation - somebody else is making decisions for us in the community when they should be listening to our people.\" The NT's children's commissioner Shahleena Musk, a Larrakia woman from Darwin, told the BBC Aboriginal children were less likely to be cautioned, more likely to be charged and pursued through the courts, and more likely to be remanded in custody than non-Aboriginal offenders. \u201cI accept that people are fearful in our communities, and crime has been quite prominent in the media and social media,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] we shouldn't be seeing these kids going into a youth justice system which is harmful, ineffective, and only compounds the very issues we're trying to change.\u201d Defending the bill, CLP politician and former youth worker Clinton Howe told the parliament the prospect of jail was the only punishment youth offenders cared about. \u201cI believe government is a blunt instrument, and I don\u2019t like it as a tool for social intervention, but for some of these children, it is the only thing left. \"We must intervene early for the sake of the child... in the environment they live in, no-one else cares.\" Critics of the bill fear the laws could arrest momentum for raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility in other states and territories. Only the Australian Capital Territory has raised the age of criminal responsibility above 10, but Victoria has passed legislation to do so, which will come into effect next year. The Tasmanian government has said it will raise the age to 14 by 2029.",

    "Massive sex tape leak could be a ploy for power in central Africa\n\nBaltasar Ebang Engonga was detained on suspicion of corruption before the videos were leaked\n\nWhat the rest of the world sees as a sex tape scandal could in fact be the latest episode in the real-life drama over who will become Equatorial Guinea\u2019s next president. Over the past fortnight, dozens of videos - estimates range from 150 to more than 400 - have been leaked of a senior civil servant having sex in his office and elsewhere with different women. They have flooded social media, shocking and titillating people in the small central African country and beyond. Many of the women filmed were wives and relatives of people close to the centre of power. It appears some were aware they were being filmed having sex with Baltasar Ebang Mr Engonga, who is also known as \u201cBello\u201d because of his good looks. All this is hard to verify as Equatorial Guinea is a highly restricted society where a free press does not exist. But one theory is that the leaks were a way to discredit the man at the centre of the storm. Mr Engonga is a nephew of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and one of those thought to be hoping to replace him. Obiang is the world\u2019s longest-serving president having been in power since 1979. The 82-year-old has overseen an economic boom that has turned to bust as a result of the now-dwindling oil reserves. There is a small, extremely wealthy elite, but many of the 1.7 million people in the country live in poverty. Obiang\u2019s administration is heavily criticised for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture, according to a US government report, external. It has also had its fair share of scandals - including the revelations about the lavish lifestyle of one of the president's sons, now vice-president, who once owned a $275,000 (\u00a3210,000) crystal-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson. Despite regular elections, there is no real opposition in Equatorial Guinea as activists have been jailed and exiled and those with designs on office are closely monitored.\n\nMichael Jackson's Bad tour glove was once owned by Vice-President Teodoro Obiang Mangue, who has ambitions to become president one day\n\nPolitics in the country is really about palace intrigue and this is where the scandal involving Mr Engonga fits in. He was the head of the National Financial Investigation Agency, and worked on tackling crimes such as money laundering. But it turned out he himself was under investigation. He was arrested on 25 October accused of embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the Cayman Islands. He has not commented on the accusation. Mr Engonga was then taken to the infamous Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo, where it is alleged that opponents of the government are subjected to brutal treatment. His phones and computers were seized and a few days later the intimate videos started appearing online. The first reference the BBC has found to them on Facebook is from 28 October on the page of Diario Rombe, external, a news site run by a journalist in exile in Spain, which said that \u201csocial networks exploded with the leaking of explicit images and videos\u201d. A post on X the following day, external referred to a \u201cmonumental scandal shaking the regime\u201d as \u201cpornographic videos flood social media\u201d.\n\nTeodoro Obiang Mangue (left) became the country's vice-president in 2016\n\nBut they are believed to have originally appeared one-by-one a few days earlier on Telegram, on one of the platform's channels known for publishing pornographic images. They were then downloaded on to people\u2019s phones and shared among WhatsApp groups in Equatorial Guinea, where they caused a storm. Mr Engonga was quickly identified along with some of the women in the videos, including relatives of the president and wives to ministers and senior military officials. The government was unable to ignore what was going on and on 30 October Vice-President Teodoro Obiang Mangue (once owner of the Michael Jackson glove) gave telecoms companies 24 hours to come up with ways to stop the spread of the clips. \u201cWe cannot continue to watch families fall apart without taking any action,\u201d he wrote on X, external. \u201cIn the meantime, the origin of these publications is being investigated to find the author or authors and make them answer for their actions.\u201d As the computer equipment was in the hands of the security forces, suspicion has fallen on someone there, who, perhaps, sought to trash Mr Engonga\u2019s reputation ahead of a trial. The police have called on women to come forward to open a case against Mr Engonga for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. One has already announced that she is suing him. What is not clear is why Mr Engonga made the recordings. But activists have put forward what could be other motives behind the explosive leak. As well as being related to the president, Mr Engonga is the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo'o, the head of the regional economic and monetary union, Cemac, and very influential in the country. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the end of an era, the end of the current president, and there is a succession [question] and this is the internal fighting we are seeing,\u201d said Equatoguinean activist Nsang Christia Esimi Cruz, now living in London. Speaking to the BBC Focus on Africa podcast, he alleged that Vice-President Obiang was trying to politically eliminate \u201canyone who could challenge his succession\u201d.\n\nPresident Teodoro Obiang Nguema secured almost 95% of the vote in elections held two years ago\n\nThe vice-president, along with his mother, are suspected to be pushing aside anyone who threatens his path to the presidency, including Gabriel Obiang Lima (another son of President Obiang from a different wife), who was oil minister for 10 years and then moved to a secondary government role. Those in the elite are thought to know things about each other that they would rather was not made public, and videos have been used in the past to humiliate and discredit a political opponent. There are also frequent accusations of coup plotting, which further fuels paranoia. But Mr Cruz also alleges that the authorities want to use the scandal as an excuse to crack down on social media, which is how a lot of information about what is really going on in the country gets out. In July, the authorities temporarily suspended the internet after protests broke out on the island of Annob\u00f3n. For him, the fact that a high-ranking official was having sex outside of marriage was not surprising as it was part of the decadent lifestyle of the country\u2019s elite. The vice-president, who himself has been convicted of corruption in France and has had lavish assets seized in various countries, wants to be seen as the man cracking down on graft and wrong-doing at home. Last year, for example, he ordered the arrest of his half-brother over allegations he sold a plane owned by the state airline. But in this case, despite the vice-president\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of the clips, they continue to be viewed. This week, he tried to appear more resolute calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in government offices \u201cto combat indecent and illicit acts\u201d, the official news agency reported, external. Saying that the scandal had \u201cdenigrated the image of the country\u201d he ordered that any officials found engaging in sex acts at work would be suspended as this was a \"flagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d. He was not wrong that the story has attracted a lot of outside interest. Judging by Google's data, search enquiries that include the country\u2019s name have shot up since the beginning of this week. On Monday, on X, \u201cEquatorial Guinea\u201d was one of the top trending terms in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - surpassing at times interest in the US election. This has left some activists who have been trying to tell the world about what is really going on in the country frustrated. \u201cEquatorial Guinea has much bigger problems than this sex scandal,\u201d said Mr Cruz, who works for a rights organisation called GE Nuestra. \u201cThis sex scandal for us is just a symptom of the illness, it\u2019s not the illness itself. It just shows how corrupt the system is.\u201d",
    "Why are Forest so good this season - and can it last?\n\nChris Wood has 23 Premier league goals for Forest since joining, initially on loan, in 2022-23. That is more than Stan Collymore's 22 top-flight goals for the club and one short of Bryan Roy's long-standing record of 24\n\nAre Nottingham Forest showing signs of 'doing a Leicester 2016'? Hang on, hear us out first... The broad picture is this:\n\u2022 None Forest are third in the Premier League - their highest position since 1998 - after winning three on the bounce in the top flight for the first time since 1999\n\u2022 None Their opening 10 games mirror Leicester's 2015-16 start when the Foxes stunned the sport as they won the Premier League at odds of 5,000-1\n\u2022 None Forest's five wins, four draws and one defeat is identical to Leicester's record, although they have three more clean sheets than Claudio Ranieri's side did nine years ago and a better goal difference by seven\n\u2022 None Striker Chris Wood - a different player but just as talismanic as Jamie Vardy - has eight goals and they have the second-best defence in the division, having only avoided relegation by four points last season.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The Football News Show: Are Nottingham Forest too reliant on striker Chris Wood?\n\nForest's search for a new striker to support and challenge Wood ultimately failed as Eddie Nketiah joined Crystal Palace from Arsenal and Feyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez remained at De Kuip. \"In the transfer window we were looking for many options that could help us. The main thing was we looked for someone who could improve us and someone who wanted to be with us. These two things are very important,\" said Nuno, tellingly, in September. It looked like they would be short up front but Wood's electric start has neutralised any fears.\n\u2022 None The 32-year-old New Zealand international has scored more than half of Forest's 14 goals this season and has 22 goals in 30 Premier League starts since making his move from Newcastle permanent in June 2023\n\u2022 None Nineteen of those league goals have come under Nuno since the Portuguese boss arrived last December\n\u2022 None Only Manchester City's Erling Haaland has scored more non-penalty goals than Wood's 18 since 23 December 2023\n\u2022 None Wood also has the fourth best conversion rate (32.8%) in the Premier League since Nuno arrived and is over-performing his expected goals figure (14.04) by almost five goals. Nuno has refused to tread softly with Wood, especially after international duty, saying the striker is a \"competitor\" and will always be ready.\n\nThe arrival of Nikola Milenkovic (right) from Fiorentina has helped shore up Forest's previously vulnerable defence from set-pieces\n\nWhile Wood has scored the goals, the management will always highlight that their foundations start in defence. Matz Sels - having become the undisputed number one - has kept the joint-most clean sheets, along with Manchester United's Andre Onana and Liverpool's Alisson Becker, in the Premier League this season. The arrival of Nikola Milenkovic from Fiorentina - for a little less than the reported \u00a312m - has already looked a bargain and he has formed an impressive partnership with Brazilian Murillo at the back.\n\u2022 None Last season Forest conceded 23 of their 68 goals from set-pieces, four more than relegated Luton and Sheffield United, but this season have let in just one\n\u2022 None Last season's figure was almost double their expected set-piece goals against of 12.25, highlighting a fragility from corners and free-kicks\n\u2022 None In a stark transformation, this season Forest have the best xG against figure from set pieces - just 1.23 - in the league. It is too simplistic to say the big man at the back and the big man at the front have Forest ticking - but it is definitely working.\n\nForest have courted controversy since they returned to the Premier League in 2022-23 with owner Evangelos Marinakis a high-profile figure\n\nWhile it looks like Forest have evolved quickly from the side which finished 17th last season, following a four-point deduction, seven of the players from Saturday's 3-0 win over West Ham started the final day victory at Burnley last term. Boss Nuno Espirito Santo had the luxury of a pre-season this year, and while the club added just six senior signings in the summer, defender Milenkovic and midfielder Elliot Anderson instantly upped the first-team quality. Indeed, that relatively calm window was a change from the summer of 2022 when Forest signed a then-record 22 players following promotion. It has been evolution, not revolution, at the City Ground but while there have been tweaks in the last 11 months since Nuno replaced Steve Cooper, they have moved on quickly from two years ago. In Forest's 1-0 win over Crystal Palace last month, with Morgan Gibbs-White suspended, just one player signed during that 2022 spending spree started - and that was goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who was playing for the opposition. There was an agreement at the start of the season the club needed a campaign of anonymity, a mid-table finish to avoid the spotlight following two seasons of struggle, controversy and chaos. A points deduction in March, following a profit and sustainability breach, came before a controversial social media post about VAR Stuart Attwell a month later which ultimately saw the club fined \u00a3750,000 this season. With owner Evangelos Marinakis currently midway through a five-game for spitting towards officials - he lost his appeal on Monday - Forest have snubbed the quiet life again. But it is on the pitch where they are making the most noise this season.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNuno returned to the Premier League after a spell in Saudi Arabia and there were a few doubters when he replaced Steve Cooper in December last year. He had won the Saudi Pro League and the Super Cup with Al-Ittihad but after a short and difficult time at Tottenham, Forest fans would have been forgiven for being underwhelmed at his appointment. His four-year spell at Wolves ended as things went stale at Molineux and the squad was unable to maintain their spectacular rise from the Championship to the Europa League quarter-finals. But before the decline, he built a squad - with the help of agent Jorge Mendes - which included young talent like Ruben Neves combined with the experience of Joao Moutinho. He is slowly doing the same at the City Ground with the arrival of six senior players, including defender Milenkovic who has helped Forest tighten up at the back and concede just seven goals so far. Only Liverpool - six - have shipped less. Those who have covered Nuno at either Wolves, Spurs or now Forest know he is not the most expressive in news conferences. He is a meticulous planner of what happens on the pitch which, over the course of a year, has steadily improved Forest's prospects, although he has still benefited from the foundations predecessor Cooper laid. Cooper's influence and relationship was crucial to signing Gibbs-White - with whom he won the Under-17 World Cup while England youth manager - while the now-Leicester boss brought Wood to the club and kept them in the Premier League. Nuno has built on that success, although he has let his emotions get the better of him on the touchline - despite promising to rein in the criticism of officials - and in August he was fined \u00a340,000 and given a one-game suspended ban after his comments following the 2-0 defeat at Everton last season. That suspension was activated when he was dismissed for contesting Gibbs-White's red card in the draw at Brighton in September, meaning he has watched Forest's past three games from the stands.\n\nDespite Nuno and owner Marinakis' disciplinary issues, Forest are on a three-game winning run which has propelled them to third. Trips to Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United come swiftly after the international break, which starts after Sunday's league visit of Newcastle, while they also host Aston Villa and Tottenham before the end of the year. Those who are sceptical of their chances will point to the fact that five of their 10 games so far have come against the bottom seven, while their past three games have been against Crystal Palace, Leicester and West Ham, none of whom have started the season well. But Forest have gone to Anfield to inflict leaders Liverpool's only defeat this season and have also claimed draws at Chelsea and Brighton.\n\u2022 None Opta's expected points model has Forest in fifth and suggests they are over-performing their game statistics by 2.23 points\n\u2022 None Compared to last season, Forest have turned an away defeat by Liverpool into a win and losses to Bournemouth (h) and Brighton (a) into draws\n\u2022 None Forest have had the fourth-easiest opening 10 fixtures but they now face the fourth-most difficult fixtures for their next 10 outings. Sunday's game against Newcastle - who won at the City Ground in the Carabao Cup in August - starts a spell which will test Forest's staying power and by Christmas it will be clear whether they can sustain their form.",
    "Two-division champion Jones made his first heavyweight title defence against Miocic\n\nIt's hard to look at it any other way - Jon Jones is an enigma. Throughout UFC 309's fight week and his extraordinary career, Jones has been defined by his unpredictability inside and outside the octagon. At 37 years old, after 23 UFC fights and a record 16 wins in championship bouts, Jones is still finding new ways to puzzle and dismantle opponents. Jones is a perfectionist - he is known for watching hours of tape on his opponents before fights to seek out their weaknesses. This time Jones' weapon of choice was a crunching spinning back-kick which dropped opponent Stipe Miocic in front of nearly 20,000 roaring fans at New York's Madison Square Garden. It was a technique he started working on earlier this year, inspired by legendary martial artist and actor Bruce Lee. \"About six months ago we started training the spinning back-kick. My taekwondo coach would come over to my house, we trained that same kick three hours a week for several months,\" said Jones. \"Bruce Lee says he doesn't fear the man that knows 10,000 kicks, but the man who has worked one kick 10,000 times. I worked it and it was a devastating shot.\"\n\nEven before Jones landed the finishing blow, fellow American Miocic had little answer to the diversity of the attacks which were aimed his way. Some of it was likely to do with age. At 42 and after being away from the octagon for nearly four years, Miocic was nowhere near his prime. But a lot of it was to do with Jones' deep arsenal, as jabs, high-kicks, elbows, knees from the clinch and takedowns were all used to break Miocic down. And it's not just when he fights - Jones has been as unpredictable outside the octagon this week as he was in it. Earlier in the week he used an expletive to describe Britain's interim champion Tom Aspinall, who Jones has largely dismissed as a prospect to fight next. The same day he walked out of an interview with sports broadcaster TNT Sports, citing he was expecting an \"Aspinall fest\". Then he turned on Miocic, refusing to shake his hand at a news conference before changing his mind and accepting a handshake the following day at the weigh-ins. Jones is polarising and has been so throughout his UFC career, which has been punctuated by doping bans and problems in his personal life. UFC president Dana White knows this better than anyone. \"Me and Jon Jones never got on out of the cage. We had a horrendous relationship for 10 years,\" said Dana White. \"We don't have that kind of relationship anymore, but I didn't have to like him to realise who he is and what he's capable of and seeing the brilliance. He is the best to ever fight, period. \"It's unbelievable what he did tonight. As long as he's active he's the pound for pound best in the world.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThere are few fighters that look more at home in the build-up to a fight than Jones. On Thursday, Jones beamed backstage as he was presented with an electric guitar from a staff member at Madison Square Garden in honour of his UFC achievements. On the day of the fight, Jones could be seen sparring in the octagon in an empty Madison Square Garden - something which is uncommon for UFC fighters. Hours before he was due to walk out to face Miocic, Jones could be seen live on Instagram, singing with his team as he made his way to the arena. Jones had hinted at retirement before his win over Miocic but says he plans to carry on if the UFC makes him an offer he can't refuse. If they don't, Jones feels content with the way his historic UFC career will come to an end. \"Professing my love for Jesus in front of everyone tonight, being an American champion, doing that in front of my president [former and the next US president Donald Trump]. If Stipe was my last fight, that was the way to do it,\" said Jones.\n\u2022 None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",
    "Son who killed parents 'could have had treatment'\n\nMary and Bryan Andrews were described as \"a team of enviable strength\"\n\nAn inquest has found that there were \"significant time lapses\" in mental health treatment for a man who killed his parents during a psychotic episode. James Andrews, known to his family as Duncan, killed Mary, 76, and Bryan Andrews, 79, at their home in Terrey Road, Totley, in Sheffield, in November 2022. Senior coroner Tanyka Rawden was told on Wednesday that he was denied a referral to specialist services after complaining of episodes thought to have been brought on by epileptic seizures. Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust's interim medical director, Helen Crimlisk, told the hearing that \"a number of changes\" had been made since the tragedy.\n\nMs Rawden said: \u201cHad there been regular and appropriate interaction between services, and had the early intervention service referral been accepted, it is possible that treatment could have been given.\u201d Andrews was given an indefinite hospital order in July 2023 after he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.\n\nThe court heard how he had accessed mental health services in November 2011 when he suffered a seizure, leading to him feeling paranoid. Andrews had complained about having psychotic episodes, including suicidal thoughts, and told a helpline \u201csomething serious is going to happen\u201d, said Dr Jonathan Mitchell, consultant psychiatrist. Giving evidence, Prof Markus Reuber, honorary consultant at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said those who were epileptic were more likely to be depressed and it was \u201cextremely common\u201d for people to have mental health issues such as anxiety after seizures. All anti-seizure medication, such as that which Andrews had been prescribed during treatment, has side effects which could include depression, the court was told. A referral to Sheffield Health and Social Care\u2019s early intervention team was refused in mid-2022. This decision meant an opportunity to identify whether Andrews' psychotic episodes were persistent was missed, the inquest in Sheffield heard. This referral could have helped Andrews be given different treatment, the coroner said.\n\nMr and Mrs Andrews were killed at the home on Terrey Road, Totley, Sheffield\n\nIt is believed that two days before Andrews killed his parents he had four seizures, a report from doctors at the secure unit he was staying at stated. At the time of the killings, he was likely to be suffering from postictal psychosis, a mental health condition after a seizure where the person can have aggressive outbursts, Prof Reuber said. There were \u201cclearly structural problems\u201d in the way notes between mental health teams and neurology teams were shared, the consultant added. This meant doctors prescribing medication might not know that some patients have mental health conditions unless they are specifically told, Prof Reuber added. The coroner said there was a concern around communication between services at the trust, especially looking at \u201cthe relationship diagnosis of epilepsy and psychotic symptoms\u201d with Andrews. \u201cThis led to significant time lapses between treatment, and rejection to services, most notably the early intervention service.\u201d A prevention of future deaths report would be sent to Sheffield Health and Social Care looking at the communication between services, \u201cin particular between psychiatrists and neurology\u201d, Ms Rawden said.\n\nSally Andrews (right) gave a statement to the media outside the court alongside her sister Lucie\n\nMr and Mrs Andrews' daughters Sally and Lucie read out a family statement outside the coroner's court. They described their father as a \"true Yorkshireman\" who loved ballroom dancing, while their mother was a \"people person\" who made lunches for elderly neighbours. Together they were called \u201ca team of enviable strength\u201d. The sisters found their parents fatally injured at their home. Sally told the court there was \u201csome comfort that we, including Duncan, were there together for one final time\u201d. \u201cThey would have been absolutely devastated that day,\u201d she added. Speaking on a video link from a secure hospital, James Duncan Andrews said: \u201cI loved my parents right to the end. I wish this had never happened.\u201d He thanked his sisters for their support during the inquest. \"We are deeply sorry for the tragic loss of Bryan and Mary Andrews in November 2022, and our heartfelt sympathies remain with their family,\" Ms Crimlisk, from the NHS trust, said. \"All those involved with Duncan\u2019s care have taken immediate steps to learn from this tragedy. We have already made a number of changes and we will continue to make improvements to address the concerns highlighted through the inquest process.\" The coroner recorded a conclusion that Mr and Mrs Andrews were unlawfully killed.

    "Ukraine's double challenge: Russia's advance and the return of Trump\n\nAnastasiia Bolvihina fled the besieged city of Pokrovsk with her two sons\n\nAs the Russian army slowly advances in eastern Ukraine, it\u2019s driving a tide of human suffering before it. With two months to go before a change of administration in Washington, Ukraine is wrestling with two problems: how to stem the advance, and how to prepare for Donald Trump. At a shelter in Pavlohrad, about 60 miles (100km) west of the slowly shifting front line, evacuees are constantly arriving from villages and towns overtaken by the war. Anastasiia Bolvihina, 31, is there with her two sons, Arseniy and Rostyslav. The family cat lies sleeping among the few belongings the family have managed to bring with them from the village of Uspenivka, just outside the besieged city of Pokrovsk. The family hung on in their house as long as they could, but with explosions all around, shops closed and roads cut off one by one, they finally bowed to the inevitable. They packed up a few bags, locked the door and left. \u201cWe hoped the war would pass us and end soon,\u201d Anastasiia tells me. Now, after two months without electricity or the internet, she has her laptop open on the bed and is catching up with the news. \u201cWe hope things will be better and the war will end,\u201d she replies when I ask about political changes far away in the US. \u201cI hope the new president will be better than the current one.\u201d\n\nIn an adjacent auditorium, dimly lit and warmed by a single bar heater, elderly evacuees are being looked after by volunteers. It\u2019s a theatre of misery, with still, exhausted figures sitting or lying on camp beds, some apparently lost in thought 83-year-old Kateryna Klymko, from Sukhi Yaly near Kurakhove \u2013 another town slowly being overrun by the Russians \u2013 has just arrived. She briefly sobs as she describes how her house burned down, with all her possessions. \u201cThey bombed so much,\u201d she says of the advancing Russian army. \u201cIt\u2019s like the last judgement!\u201d Could Ukraine still win, I ask? \u201cGod only knows,\u201d she sighs. \u201cMy heart aches from what I hear. We were bombed so much and so many people died there.\u201d Russia launched an enormous ballistic missile strike on Dnipro overnight too. It was felt across the city and sent everyone including the BBC team to bomb shelters. The Biden administration\u2019s latest decisions on Atacms and land mines are clearly designed to help Ukraine hold on to territory, both its own and in the Kursk region of Russia. Both could feature in negotiations next year, if that\u2019s the path Donald Trump intends to pursue.\n\nSo far, the US president-elect has given very few clues as to how he intends to end the conflict, beyond a typically vainglorious promise to end the war in 24 hours. Ukrainian politicians, from President Zelensky on down, seem keen to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI think he has taken a very smart approach,\u201d former foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told me, \u201cby clearly setting out the goal \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m going to fix it\u2019 \u2013 but without getting into details.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s reputation \u2013 a zero-sum deal-maker with a curious admiration for Vladimir Putin \u2013 Dmytro Kuleba says people tend to oversimplify him. \u201cHe can hold a bigger picture in his head, and I\u2019m sure it will not be simply transactional.\u201d As the new administration is assembled and minds start to turn to how to realise Trump\u2019s ambition, the former foreign minister believes one overriding factor will drive policy. \u201cPresident Trump will undoubtedly be driven by one goal, to project his strength, his leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd show that he is capable of fixing problems which his predecessor failed to fix.\u201d Projecting strength, Kuleba believes, will mean leaning on both sides. Walking away from Ukraine, he says, is not an option.\n\nWithout US military aid, President Zelensky fears Ukraine would fall to Russia\n\n\u201cAs much as the fall of Afghanistan inflicted a severe wound on the foreign policy reputation of the Biden administration, if the scenario you mentioned is to be entertained by President Trump, Ukraine will become his Afghanistan, with equal consequences. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think this is what he\u2019s looking for.\u201d Last weekend, President Zelensky said Kyiv would like to end the war through \u201cdiplomatic means\u201d in 2025. The war, he said, would end \u201csooner\u201d with Trump in the White House. Among many of those who have paid the heaviest price for Russia\u2019s invasion, peace cannot come soon enough, even if that means further sacrifices. In Dnipro, a steady stream of injured soldiers comes through the doors of one of the country\u2019s many prosthetic centres. Demian Dudlya, 27, lost a leg when his unit came under missile attack 18 months ago. He\u2019s already used to his carbon fibre limb and is even training for next year\u2019s Invictus Games. But when it comes to the war, he\u2019s less optimistic. \u201cI think most likely two regions [Donetsk and Luhansk] will be taken from us, and Crimea,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not confident we will push them back from those regions. We have neither people nor weapons.\u201d\n\nDemian lost his leg in a Russian missile attack in 2023\n\nOpinion polls paint a mixed picture but show that more and more Ukrainians want this war to end, soon. Especially here in the east, where the sirens sound several times a day. A growing minority say they\u2019re willing to give up territory to secure peace. \u201cI think that the end of the war will happen, says 28-year-old Andrii Petrenko, when I ask him what he expects when Donald Trump takes office. Andrii is being fitted with his first prosthetic, after losing a leg three months ago. \u201cEither they will agree and go to the 1991 borders, or the territories will be surrendered. The main thing is that the war ends and people stop dying.\u201d",
    "Campaigners said the equivalent of 17 tankers of waste a day was dumped into a Pembrokeshire river (file photo)\n\nTens of thousands of cubic metres of untreated waste water, including sewage, was dumped in a river in 2023, campaigners have said. The Cleddau Project said Welsh Water data showed pumps at Picton in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, were running at 80% capacity from July 2022 to February 2024. That meant 56,000 cubic metres - the equivalent of 17 tankers a day - which should have been going to a sewage treatment plant, was instead going into special conservation area the Western Cleddau. Welsh Water apologised and said its Picton pumping station had been upgraded and spills cut.\n\nRic Cooper said a pipe was \"spilling what looked like raw sewage more often than we'd ever seen in the past\"\n\nBut it admitted there could be problems at other sites across Wales. The Cleddau Project's Ric Cooper said campaigners investigated because an overflow pipe at Picton playing fields appeared to be spilling more raw sewage than usual.\n\nThe group asked Welsh Water for pump performance data from the nearby pumping station. They are, according to Mr Cooper, supposed to pump at 120 litres a second but had only been operating at \"95 or 96\". \"That means 20% of what should have gone for treatment was going straight into the river,\" he said. \"We calculated over 12 months, and it averages out as 17 tankers a day emptying into this river. \"You can imagine the outcry if on 17 occasions, a tanker pulled up and let it all go.\" Welsh Water data showed the overflow pipe at Picton in 2023 discharged 133 times for almost 647 hours. The Cleddau Project said it found high levels of ammonia in the water and that tests showed sewage was being discharged at levels toxic to fish. The group said it was reported to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) several times, which investigated in June 2023, almost a year later.\n\nThe Cleddau Project said pumps at Picton pumping station, in Haverfordwest, were operating at just 80% capacity for 18 months\n\nThe Cleddau Project said it took another nine months before the pumps were up to speed. Another campaigner, Simon Walters, said the spills would affect sewin and salmon movements. He added that E. coli levels were \"way\" above that permitted for safe bathing. He said: \"We used to swim in here as kids. I wouldn't let my dog swim in here now.\" NRW and Welsh Water bosses, he believed, needed to resolve the matter. Mid and South Pembrokeshire MP Henry Tufnell, who met the Cleddau Project members, Welsh Water and NRW last week, called the pollution \"not acceptable\".\n\nSimon Walters said the area was a special area of conservation and should be protected\n\nNRW needed more resources, he believed, as it was investigating only 20% of alleged breaches reported. He said the UK government was taking \"definitive action\" on tackling pollution with a bill which would give increased powers to regulators to tackle polluting companies. In July, Ofwat confirmed it had served formal notices and opened an enforcement case against Welsh Water and three other companies into how they managed waste water treatment works and networks. Welsh Water \"apologised\" for any damage to the Western Cleddau. Waste water chief Steve Wilson said the equipment monitor flow on the Picton overflow pipe had been fitted before the deadline of regulator NRW. \"To upgrade that pumping station, we had to install new pumps and a new panel, which actually took 26 weeks to be built,\" he added.\n\nThe Cleddau Project said data showed a storm overflow pipe at Picton playing fields discharged 133 times in 2023\n\nIt was now operating correctly, he said. Mr Wilson said the company was upgrading sites in Wales as fast as possible to improve water quality. The company, he said, planned to spend \u00a34bn between 2025 and 2030, with \u00a3100m on improvement and maintenance in Pembrokeshire, subject to Ofwat approval. NRW confirmed it was made aware of a problem in June 2023, and was told by Welsh Water new pumps would be installed by 31 October 2023. It said the deadline was missed and Welsh Water were given a formal warning. The work to repair the pumps was completed in February 2024, it said. NRW said the pumping station was \"subject to a formal legal investigation for another matter\".",
    "Australian consumers paid an eyewatering A$17.50 ($12;\u00a39) for the snacks at a pop-up that had no affiliation with Crumbl\n\nSet against a backdrop of cliffside mansions, bronzed bodies, and vast ocean views - Bondi is the go-to suburb for international brands looking to launch down under. So, when news broke on TikTok that a Crumbl Cookie pop-up was coming to Sydney's iconic beachside hub, few raised questions. With a host of famous fans, the US-based bakery chain - which only sells domestically and in Canada - has secured a cult-like following. But when Australian foodies sunk their teeth into the treats, outrage spread like wildfire after it became clear they were eating days-old goods, sold by a few enterprising locals - with no connection to Crumbl - who had brought the cookies back in suitcases from Hawaii.\n\nAdding insult to injury was the eye-watering price tag, with consumers paying A$17.50 ($12;\u00a39) for the stale snacks, which had aged inside the belly of a commercial airline. Labelled the great \"cookie controversy\" and \"Crumblgate\" by commentators, the doughy drama has sparked debate online - prompting calls for legal action to be taken against the sellers, as well as jabs against those willing to pay such an exorbitant amount simply to be pictured indulging in the latest trendy treat. It even inspired a last-minute Washington Post Food review of the cookies, which ruled them \"underwhelming\" and \"under baked\". The saga unfolded after scores of people spent the day snaking around a commercial block in North Bondi on Sunday to secure their brightly coloured signature Crumbl box. All of it was seemingly captured on TikTok - often in real-time - as consumer after consumer filmed themselves biting into the hardened treats, responding with a series of grimaces rather than delight. \"This is actually very bad... the texture is just weird,\" one vlogger said. \"I spent A$150 on 10 cookies,\" another woman blurted out mid-video, before offering a scathing review. Another group recorded themselves simply sniffing the battered treats, before offering a ranking of 3/10. The founder of the US company, quickly took to social media to clarify that the Australian pop-up, was not affiliated with his firm.\n\nThe US juggernaut has a loyal fan base, partly due to its forever changing roster of flavours\n\nAll of which prompted a confusing story, followed by an apology by the Sydney organisers. In a statement, a spokesperson - who declined to give his full name - said that hundreds of the cookies had been purchased while on a trip to Hawaii and then brought back to Australia in luggage. He said that everything the pop-up had done - including using professionally shot photographs of the sweets and mimicking the Crumbl branding - was \"legal\". And that they'd tried to adhere to the Crumbl storage requirements, which advises that the products can still be consumed after three days, if kept in an airtight container. \u201cWe kept them to these requirements. Some were warmed to enhance their texture, which is what Crumbl does as well. \"We apologise that they don\u2019t live up to expectations. However, they are just cookies at the end of the day,\u201d the statement added. The strangeness of a group of people \"going on an international flight to go and procure biscuits\" is not lost on Australian marketing expert Andrew Hughes, however he says the bait and switch tactics are far from new. One recent example he pointed to was when scores of people bought tickets to a so-called Bridgerton-themed ball in Detroit, Michigan. But instead of being met with the glitz, glamour and expensive food event organisers had promised, they were left with soggy noodles, a single violin, and a pole dancer. To understand how these viral scams lure people in, it\u2019s important to examine the powerful emotions elicited by the \"fear of missing out\" - or FOMO for short \u2013 Hughes says. \"In an age where information travel so quickly\u2026 people don\u2019t want to be behind the curve. They act out of impulse instead of logic,\u201d he explains. It's unclear whether the Crumbl spin off violated Australian consumer law, or whether those affected have grounds to act. But beyond a few cease-and-desist letters, Hughes thinks it's unlikely the US-brand will take further action. \"They'll deny it. They'll say it's bad. But at the end of the day, it's good publicity because it raises their brand awareness in Australia. \"All of a sudden, people who hadn't heard of them are now talking about them.\"",

    "The rise and fall of Matt Gaetz in eight wild days\n\nEight tumultuous days after US President-elect Donald Trump picked Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, the firebrand congressman has withdrawn from consideration for the post. It was a nomination that stunned Washington and sent a shiver through the corridors of the justice department. Trump settled on Gaetz, 42, during a two-hour flight from Washington to Florida last week, according to reports. Still basking in the glow of his election victory, the president-elect was flying back to West Palm Beach last Wednesday afternoon after a cordial meeting with President Joe Biden.\n\nThat morning Gaetz was not even on the shortlist for the position of America\u2019s top law officer, according to Politico, but Trump had felt underwhelmed by his other options.\n\nOn so-called Trump Force One that day were Gaetz himself, Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn, reports the New York Times. Epshteyn reportedly set about convincing Trump that Gaetz should lead the justice department, which had conducted a sex-trafficking investigation into the lawmaker before dropping the matter. The allegation that Gaetz had sex with a minor, which he denies, was set to dominate and probably torpedo his nomination process. Losing his first choice is a setback to Trump and shows the reluctance of the Senate in ushering through a man who has no shortage of enemies in Congress. The woman Trump has picked instead, another Floridian Pam Bondi, would seem to have more allies and a smoother path ahead. Gaetz, a lawyer, has been one of Trump\u2019s most strident defenders on Capitol Hill. He helped prepare the Republican nominee for his televised debate against Biden that effectively knocked the Democrat out of the White House race. One Trump adviser explained why the president-elect - who has himself been criminally investigated by the justice department, and accuses its prosecutors of witch hunts - took a shine to Gaetz as opposed to other contenders. \u201cEveryone else looked at AG [attorney general] as if they were applying for a judicial appointment,\u201d the unnamed aide told the Bulwark. \u201cGaetz was the only one who said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll go over there and start cuttin\u2019 [expletive] heads.\u2019\u201d\n\nGaetz emerged as one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House\n\nWhile Republicans on Capitol Hill reacted tepidly to the nomination, career lawyers at the justice department told US media they were stunned and outraged. Speaking at a conservative conference last year, Gaetz had suggested that the justice department and the agencies it oversees, including the FBI, ought to be abolished, as he argued they were being weaponised against conservatives. The current Attorney General, Merrick Garland, has rejected these claims. Critics said Trump - who has also named three lawyers that defended him in criminal cases for senior positions at the justice department - was more interested in hiring loyalists than appointees who will uphold the rule of law. Former Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton dismissed Gaetz as the \u201cworst cabinet-level appointment in history\u201d. But the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, said the furore from the Washington establishment showed his father\u2019s unconventional cabinet picks were just the kind of change-makers that American voters had elected him to usher in.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAfter being nominated last week for attorney general, Gaetz resigned as representative for Florida's 1st congressional district, a seat he has held since 2017. His resignation came as the House Ethics Committee was due to decide whether to release a report on its investigation into allegations of misconduct involving drugs, bribes and paying for sex, including with an underage girl. Gaetz dismissed the claims as a smear. But his resignation triggered a drip feed of leaks in subsequent days as the ethics panel wrangled over what to do about the report. Few Republicans seemed willing, meanwhile, to circle the wagons round one of the most unpopular lawmakers in the House. Last year, the combative Gaetz came under fire from his own side of the aisle when he proved instrumental in ousting Republican Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker. Markwayne Mullin, a former House member turned senator, told CNN at the time there was a reason why none of Gaetz\u2019s colleagues would defend him from allegations of sexual misconduct. \"Because we had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor,\" said the Oklahoman last October, accusing Gaetz of bragging about his sexual exploits.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Gaetz confirmation would have been 'challenging' - Lindsey Graham\n\nAs the backlash to his nomination for attorney general began to build this week, Trump made calls to senators in an effort to shore up support. Trump seemed to be holding firm on Gaetz as he attended a SpaceX rocket launch in Boca Chica, Texas, on Tuesday with Musk. Asked if he was reconsidering, the president-elect said: \"No.\" There was more encouraging news for Gaetz on Wednesday as House Ethics Committee Republicans voted not to release its investigation into him. It happened as Vice-President-elect JD Vance ferried the attorney general nominee around the Senate in a charm offensive. Gaetz said it had been \u201ca great day\u201d. But there were hints of turbulence ahead. When asked how messy the confirmation process could become, incoming Senate majority leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said the hearings could be \u201con steroids\u201d.\n\nPam Bondi has been picked to fill Gaetz's shoes\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump was still calling Republican senators to gauge Gaetz's chances. But by lunchtime, the nominee had come to the conclusion he didn't have the votes and he again shocked Washington with the announcement that he was showing himself the door. \u201cWhile the momentum was strong,\u201d he posted on X, \u201cit is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\u201d Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social confirming the volte-face - his first political setback since his election 16 days earlier - was unusually muted for the president-elect. \u201cI greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General,\u201d he wrote, adding that the nominee did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Hours later, Trump nominated former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi instead for the post. While Trump predicted a \"wonderful future\" for Gaetz, a question mark hangs over what he will do next. He was comfortably re-elected this month, but there are already plans for a special election to fill his vacated seat. Randy Ross, a Florida-based fundraiser for Trump, told the BBC that America had not heard the last of Matt Gaetz. \u201cMy opinion is there\u2019s still a spot in Trump\u2019s administration, Florida or our country\u2019s future leadership for this patriot,\" said Mr Ross. \"We all look forward to his next steps.\" Meanwhile, Ginger Gaetz, who wed the congressman in 2021, posted an old photo on X following his withdrawal of them both on the steps on Capitol Hill. \"The end of an era,\" she commented.\n\nMatt and Ginger Gaetz walk down the Capitol steps last year",

The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project. \"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\" The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\". That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021. Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.\n\u2022 None Listen: Suffolk Actually - Christmas gets the Curtis touch\n\nWhen the parents get caught in a blizzard, the children suddenly become free to design their dream Christmas\n\nThe theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted. \"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News. \"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up. \"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\" He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\" The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.\n\nDirector Simon Otto (left), actress Fiona Shaw and writer Richard Curtis attended the film's premiere last month\n\nThat Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics. \"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye., external \"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy. \"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\" Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested, external the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\". \"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide., external \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"\n\nThe parents in the film anxiously wait to hear whether their children are OK\n\nThe film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions. In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually. Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\". \"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\" One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences. \"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"\n\nOne striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years, external his approach to casting would be different today. But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\". It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety. There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran. Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes. \"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"\n\nThe film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with several contenders in the awards race\n\nOtto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people. \"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\" The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race. But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up. Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it, external as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\" Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years. \"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",
    "This story contains detailed descriptions of offensive sexual acts.\n\nLate at night in October 2022, my mobile lit up with a withheld number.\n\nThere was a man at the other end of the call, a voice - and then he started making noises.\n\nWithout a doubt, this stranger was masturbating down the phone.\n\nThe noises got louder and louder. My heart raced, struggling to believe what I\u2019d just heard. I hung up. But the phone rang again and again.\n\nAt this point, I switched into journalist mode.\n\nI knew this man needed to be reported and I was sure the police could trace the call - but they\u2019d need evidence.\n\nSo I ran upstairs and grabbed my work phone. On his third or fourth attempt to call back I picked up the call and put it on speakerphone, and recorded him.\n\nFor five minutes I listened and recorded as he masturbated, calling out my first name, using vulgar language to say \u201csuck my [penis]\u201d and making other obscene and lewd comments about my genitalia. I wondered when he would have had enough and when I would have enough evidence.\n\nI was concerned about my personal safety: if this man knew my first name and number, did he know me? Had I met him? Was it someone I\u2019d interviewed? Did he know where I lived?\n\nHe had an accent I didn\u2019t recognise, maybe Midlands. I assumed it was in some way connected to the fact I was an on-air BBC journalist but I wasn\u2019t sure. I dialled 999 to report the crime.\n\nThe following day I went to my local police station to give a statement and was asked to upload the taped recording onto the Metropolitan Police\u2019s system.\n\nI was naively hopeful they could use it to quickly trace the caller and arrest the man.\n\nI\u2019ve worked on too many stories of violence against women - including the disappearance and subsequent rape and murder of Sarah Everard.\n\nPolice had failed to investigate Wayne Couzens for at least three indecent exposure offences before he murdered Sarah Everard. Experts say those offences may have been a \u201cred flag\u201d that someone could go onto more serious offending.\n\nSo I had two concerns: my own safety and making sure this man couldn\u2019t go on to commit more serious sexual offences.\n\nThe whole ordeal would turn out to be an eye-opening experience into why so many sexual offences go unreported or unpunished, how slow the police and justice system move and how despite the warm words, women are still being failed, due to police incompetence.\n\nPolice actually dropped my case and only reopened it after a Victims\u2019 Right to Review was carried out.\n\nHe was eventually charged - but he wouldn\u2019t have been if I hadn\u2019t taken control of it.\n\nTo make matters worse, three days ago I found out he\u2019d actually been convicted in 2015 for making 15,000 calls to random numbers - raising even more questions about why it took so long to get him charged now.\n\nThe Met Police admitted their handling of the case \u201cclearly fell short\u201d.\n\nLancashire Police said their initial handling \u201cdid not meet the standard expected\u201d.",
    "Six children rescued after bus crashes into ditch\n\nThe bus went into the ditch near Wisbech in the Cambridgeshire Fens\n\nSix children have been rescued after a bus they were travelling in crashed into a water-filled ditch. Emergency crews were called to Leverington Common near Wisbech St Mary, Cambridgeshire, at about 17:15 GMT on Thursday. The school children were evacuated from the vehicle and were not thought to be injured, police said. The driver of the bus was taken to hospital as a precaution, they added. Eyewitness Laurence Manning said he helped the children off the bus after he heard them screaming.\n\n\"We pulled each school kid out one by one and then we tended to the driver who was still in the cab,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. CCTV captured the moment the bus crashed into the ditch\n\nMr Manning said he rang for the ambulance. \"The roof was caved in. As we're in the bus we could hear creaks and cracks because it was sinking even more. \"We had to check the bus several times, it was quite scary. \"But when there are kids involved you just have to get them to safety. \"Luckily everyone was all right - few injuries but nothing serious.\"\n\nLaurence Manning said he helped get the children out of the bus\n\nA neighbour, Katie-Leigh Julian, said she looked after the children once they had been rescued. \"The experience was not nice at all when it comes down to anyone, but when it's children around and there's no parents around it is heart-breaking,\" she said. Cambridgeshire Police said emergency crews would remain at the scene, with surrounding roads expected to be closed \"well into the evening\".

    "'No-one will win' - Canada, Mexico and China respond to Trump tariff threats\n\nOfficials from Canada, Mexico and China have warned US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to impose sweeping tariffs on America's three largest trading partners could upend the economies of all four countries. \"To one tariff will follow another in response and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,\" Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said. Trump vowed on Monday night to introduce 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on goods coming from China. He said the duties were a bid to clamp down on drugs and illegal immigration. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he spoke to Trump in the hours after the announcement and planned to hold a meeting with Canada's provincial leaders on Wednesday to discuss a response.\n\nA spokesman for China's embassy in Washington DC told the BBC: \"No-one will win a trade war or a tariff war.\u201d The international pushback came a day after Trump announced his plans for his first day in office, on 20 January, in a post on his social media website, Truth Social. Trudeau said his country was prepared to work with the US in \"constructive ways\". \"This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that's what we'll do,\" Trudeau told reporters. In a phone call with Trump, Trudeau said the pair discussed trade and border security, with the prime minister pointing out that the number of migrants crossing the Canadian border was much smaller compared with the US-Mexico border. But Trump spokesman Steven Cheung added that world leaders had sought to \"develop stronger relationships\" with Trump \"because he represents global peace and stability\". Mexico's President Sheinbaum told reporters on Tuesday that neither threats nor tariffs would solve the \"migration phenomenon\" or drug consumption in the US. Reading from a letter that she said she would send to Trump, Sheinbaum also warned that Mexico would retaliate by imposing its own taxes on US imports, which would \"put common enterprises at risk\". She said Mexico had taken steps to tackle illegal migration into the US and that \u201ccaravans of migrants no longer reach the border\u201d. The issue of drugs, she added, \u201cis a problem of public health and consumption in your country\u2019s society\u201d. Sheinbaum, who took office last month, noted that US car manufacturers produce some of their parts in Mexico and Canada. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, a spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, told the BBC that \"China-US economic and trade co-operation is mutually beneficial in nature\". He denied that China allows chemicals used in the manufacture of illegal drugs - including fentanyl - to be smuggled to the US. \"China has responded to US request for verifying clues on certain cases and taken action,\" Liu said. \"All these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality.\" President Joe Biden has left in place the tariffs on China that Trump introduced in his first term, and added a few more of his own. Currently, a majority of what the two countries sell to each other is subject to tariffs - 66.4% of US imports from China and 58.3% of Chinese imports from the US.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons in Ottawa, Trudeau told lawmakers that \"the idea of going to war with the United States isn\u2019t what anyone wants\". He called on them to not \"panic\", and to work together. \"That is the work we will do seriously, methodically. But without freaking out,\u201d he said. The leaders of Canadian provinces suggested that they would impose their own tariffs on the US. \"The things we sell to the United States are the things they really need,\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday. \"We sell them oil, we sell them electricity, we sell them critical minerals and metals.\" America's northern neighbour accounted for some $437bn (\u00a3347bn) of US imports in 2022, and was the largest market for US exports in the same year, according to US data. Canada sends about 75% of its total exports to the US. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said on Monday the proposed tariff would be \"devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the US\". \u201cTo compare us to Mexico is the most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d said Ford. Ford was echoed by the premiers of Quebec, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, while a post on the X account of Alberta Premier Danielle Smith acknowledged that Trump had \"valid concerns related to illegal activities at our shared border\". The Canadian dollar, the Loonie, has plunged in value since Trump vowed to impose tariffs on Canadian imports come January. The Canadian dollar dipped below 71 US cents, the lowest level the Loonie has fallen to since May 2020, when Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods during his first stint as US president. The Mexican peso fell to its lowest value this year, around 4.8 cents.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the presidential election in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Dr Susan Gilby has accused the chairman of the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust board of \"co-ordinating\" her suspension\n\nA judge has said he was \"troubled\" after the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Trust deleted potentially important evidence ahead of an employment tribunal, including documents relevant to the Thirlwall Inquiry into the crimes of Lucy Letby. Former chief executive Dr Susan Gilby is suing the trust and its chairman, Ian Haythornthwaite, claiming constructive unfair dismissal. The tribunal was also told documents relevant to the Thirlwall Inquiry into the crimes of Letby had also been deleted from Dr Gilby's email account by her former employers - although these were later recovered. In a ruling on a preliminary application, employment judge David Franey said the failure to preserve certain emails, messages and documents was \"unexplained\".\n\nDr Gilby (pictured) accused the chairman of the board, Ian Haythornthwaite, of inappropriate and bullying behaviour\n\nDr Gilby was appointed medical director of the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in August 2018, a month after Letby was first arrested, and became chief executive in 2019. She was suspended in December 2022 and gave notice of her resignation a few days later, although her contract ran until June 2023. Dr Gilby said she had made a series of \"protected disclosures\" about the chairman of the board, Mr Haythornthwaite, who is named as a joint respondent in the claim. After she accused him of inappropriate and bullying behaviour, she claimed he became \"hostile\" and \"aggressive\" and \"co-ordinated\" her suspension, the tribunal heard. Both the trust and Mr Haythornthwaite deny the accusations and claim Dr Gilby's treatment was a \"consequence of genuine and substantial performance concerns\". The tribunal heard that within a few days of Dr Gilby's suspension in December 2022, her solicitors put the trust on notice to preserve any relevant evidence - a normal legal procedure.\n\nAfter her claim was filed with the tribunal service, senior executives at the trust, including Mr Haythornthwaite and HR managers, were also ordered by the judge to preserve and disclose Whatsapp messages and emails relevant to her suspension. However, the tribunal was told Dr Gilby later found that unknown staff at the trust had accessed her work accounts while she was suspended and deleted tranches of emails - including everything from before 24 October 2022. She also found the Whatsapp application on her work phone had been deleted and she had been removed from a group with other executives, the hearing was told. Judge Franey said he was \"most troubled\" by the fact that Mr Haythornthwaite had only disclosed a limited number of messages from his own work Whatsapp account and emails. The judge wrote: \"In principle he has most to gain from the destruction of material which helps the claimant\u2019s case on causation.\"\n\nThe tribunal also heard Dr Gilby had been permitted full access to her trust email account in April this year, so she could prepare evidence for the Thirlwall Inquiry. Dr Gilby was seeking two documents in particular, both of which she realised were missing from her inbox, and she also noted that her deleted items folder was empty, the tribunal was told. In that case, the documents were found in July by IT specialists at the trust in a 'Retrievable Items Folder' . However, any emails sent or received before September 2022 had been lost forever, the tribunal heard. Judge Franey wrote: \"The deletion on a selective basis of items from the claimant's work email account is troubling, and the wholesale deletion of the WhatsApp app and its content from her work mobile phone is unexplained.\" He said the lack of significant disclosure of phone messages from head of HR Nicola Price, or from the Whatsapp account of Mr Haythornthwaite, was \"surprising\". \"I am satisfied that in relation to these matters there has been unreasonable conduct of the proceedings by the respondents,\" he said. However, Judge Franey denied an application by Dr Gilby to have the response to her claim struck out without a full tribunal. He wrote that he was satisfied a fair trial could take place, and that the tribunal could \"draw appropriate inferences\" from the missing documentation. The case is listed for a 20-day hearing in November. A spokesperson for the hospital trust said it would not be appropriate to comment while tribunal proceedings were ongoing.",
    "Campaigners take their message to the Supreme Court\n\nA long-running legal challenge over the right to wild camp on Dartmoor is being heard at the Supreme Court in London. Alexander and Diana Darwall are challenging a Court of Appeal ruling, which said people can wild camp on some privately owned commons in the national park in Devon. The couple keep cattle on Stall Moor, which forms part of their 4,000 acre (16 sq km) estate, and claim that some campers cause problems to livestock and the environment. Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA), has said that it would seek \"to defend the public's right to access the national park for open-air recreation\" while continuing work to \"protect Dartmoor's unique characteristics\".\n\nWild camping is a form of open air recreation, the Court of Appeal ruled\n\nLawyers for the Darwalls argued on Tuesday that a 1985 law which allows \"access to the commons on foot and on horseback for the purpose of open-air recreation\" would prohibit camping. In written submissions Timothy Morshead KC argued the words \"open-air recreation\" were \"not describing what the public had a right to do on Dartmoor but, rather, describing the purpose for which the public might exercise its right to walk and ride\" on it. Mr Morshead said the Darwalls were not \"motivated by a desire to stop camping\", but concerned about \"the damage that wild camping can cause and, in particular, about the significant risk of fire associated with it\". However, lawyers for the DNPA said the phrase \"on foot\" meant \"access to the commons should be pedestrian\" rather than in a vehicle. Richard Honey KC said: \"It does not mean that persons must be standing up at all times.\" He said a law which would prevent someone on Dartmoor \"from sitting, kneeling or lying down would be absurd.\"\n\nMr Honey also disputed the suggestion wild camping could damage land. \"Erecting a tent for backpack or wild camping for a night or two would do no such damage,\" he said. Dartmoor National Park, designated in 1951, covers a 368-square mile (953 sq km) area that features commons, areas of unenclosed privately owned moorland where locals can put livestock. The Darwalls won a High Court case in January 2023 to be allowed to remove people found camping on their land. The DNPA asked appeal judges to overturn the High Court's decision and in July 2023, the Court of Appeal ruled in the DNPA's favour, with judges saying the \"critical question\" was whether wild camping could be considered a form of \"open-air recreation\", and finding it was.\n\nCampaigners joined by musicians outside the Supreme Court in London\n\nIn January, Mr and Mrs Darwall were given the green light to take the case to the Supreme Court. Campaigners The Stars are for Everyone, who were part of a demonstration at Hound Tor on Sunday, said whatever the outcome, the Darwalls' legal action had \"succeeded in unleashing something powerful and ancient, a commitment to our commons, our love for the land, our right to belong\". The hearing is due to last one day and a judgment is expected at a later date.",
    "Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to the media at the Liberal Democratic Party's headquarters on Sunday\n\nJapanese elections are normally steady and boring affairs. This snap election was neither. The dramatic vote follows a political funding corruption scandal, revealed last year, which implicated senior lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and cabinet members, tarnishing the party\u2019s image and angering the public. The electorate made that anger felt in this election and sent a strong message to the LDP, punishing it at the ballot box. According to best estimates, the LDP, which has been in power almost continuously since 1955, has lost its single party majority in the country\u2019s powerful lower house. LDP also lost its majority as a governing coalition. Its junior coalition partner Komeito lost several of its seats, including that of its chief, as well, meaning that even with its partner, the LDP is still unable to achieve the 233 seats it needs for a majority. He and the LDP underestimated the extent of people\u2019s anger and more crucially their willingness to act on it. But this was the perfect storm - a corruption scandal that saw dozens of the ruling party's lawmakers investigated for pocketing millions of dollars in proceeds from political fundraising events, while Japanese households struggle with inflation, high prices, stagnant wages and a sluggish economy. To stay in power, the LDP will now need to form a coalition with other parties it just fought in the election, and it will do so from a position of significant weakness. That means it must enter negotiations and make concessions to survive.\n\nShigeru Ishiba bows toward the Japanese flag at a press conference when newly elected party leader in September\n\nIt is hard to overstate how rare this is. The LDP has always enjoyed a safe and steady place in Japanese politics. The ruling party has a strong track record of governance \u2013 and when the opposition did take over in 1993 and 2009, for three years each time, it ended badly. Since the LDP came back to power in 2012, it managed to win one election after another almost uncontested. There has long been a resignation about the status quo, and the opposition still remains unconvincing to the public. \u201cI think we (the Japanese) are very conservative,\u201d Miyuki Fujisaki, a 66-year-old voter, told the BBC a few days before the election. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us to challenge and make a change. And when the ruling party changed once (and the opposition took over), nothing actually changed in the end, that\u2019s why we tend to stay conservative,\" she added. Ms Fujisaki said that she was unsure who to vote for this time, especially with the fundraising corruption scandal hanging over the LDP. But since she has always voted for the LDP, she was going to do the same this election too. The results of this election tell a bigger story about the state of Japanese politics: A ruling party that has dominated for decades and an opposition that has failed to unite and become a viable alternative when the public needed one. In this election, the LDP lost their majority. But no one really won. Japan\u2019s ruling party took a beating at the ballot box \u2013 but not a big enough beating that it has been booted out. Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies, told the BBC that despite voters wanting to hold their politicians accountable through elections \u201cin the minds of the voters there really is no one else\u201d they trust to be at the helm. In this election, the opposition\u2019s biggest party \u2013 the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) - made significant gains. But observers say these results are less about voters endorsing the opposition than about voters' ire with the LDP. \u201cThis election appears to be about voters who are fed up with a party and politicians they see as corrupt and dirty. But it\u2019s not one where they want to bring about a new leader,\u201d Mr Hall said. What that leaves Japan with is a weakened ruling party and a splintered opposition. Japan has long been seen as a beacon of political stability \u2013 a safe haven for investors and a reliable diplomatic partner in an increasingly unstable Asia Pacific. This political chaos in Japan is concerning not just for its public, but also its neighbours and allies. However the LDP enters power, it will do so weakened, with its hands tied in coalition concessions. The task of turning the economy around, creating coherent policies for wages and welfare and maintaining overall political stability will not be easy. Harder still will be regaining the trust and respect of a public weary of politics.",
    "Niamh and Peter Dolan have been campaigning for a decade after their son's death\n\nThe parents of a student who was killed by a drunk driver 10 years ago say a promise to bring in tougher sentences is \u201ctaking forever\u201d. Enda Dolan from Omagh, County Tyrone, was in his first term at Queen's University Belfast when he was struck by a van driven by David Lee Stewart in October 2014. His family have campaigned over the last decade to increase the maximum sentence for causing death or serious injury by dangerous driving. Justice Minister Naomi Long said she planned to bring forward a Sentencing Bill to increase the maximum penalties in such cases from 14 years to 20 years.\n\nEnda Dolan had finished secondary school just a few months before he was killed\n\nThe bill would also include a proposal to introduce a discretionary life sentence for offenders with a previous conviction for a similar offence. However, there is no timescale for when the law will change, beyond an intention to introduce legislation before the next Northern Ireland Assembly election in 2027. Enda\u2019s father, Peter Dolan, told BBC News NI it was taking too long to introduce tougher sentences. The law in England, Wales and Scotland changed in 2022 with the maximum penalty increased to a life sentence. Mr Dolan said the justice system in Northern Ireland was \u201cnot fair\u201d and needed to change. \u201cIn England and Wales the maximum there is life for a similar crime. So why are we backward here? Why does it take forever? Why are we always behind?\u201d he said. \u201cLike everything in Northern Ireland it takes forever and you\u2019re sort of wondering, listen we\u2019re 10 years shouting about this. \u201cCan we not get this over the line?\u201d Mr Dolan believes \u201cit should be life for committing such a horrendous crime\u201d and tougher sentences would be a \u201cmajor deterrent\u201d for people who drive under the influence of drink or drugs. A change in the law would be \u201ca great achievement but I think it needs to happen sooner rather than later\", he said. \u201cThings are not going to change for us, you know, it\u2019s not going to change anything,\" Mr Dolan said. \u201cEnda\u2019s not going to come home and say right, okay, I\u2019m back. That\u2019s not happening. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things. I think we would rest happier.\u201d\n\nPeter Dolan said his family had spent \"10 years shouting\" about sentencing rules\n\nEnda Dolan, a talented artist and musician who was studying architecture, was walking to his student accommodation when a van was driven onto a footpath and hit him. A trial heard that the driver, David Lee Stewart, drove with the teenager on the roof of his van for about 800 yards before he stopped. The court was told Stewart, of Gray's Park Avenue, took 13 drinks, including six pints of beer and four Jagerbombs - a mix of a spirit and an energy drink. Traces of drugs, including cocaine, were also found in his system. He received a sentence of seven years, half to be served in prison and half on licence. It was later increased to nine years on appeal. Following the case in 2016 the then-justice minister, Claire Sugden, announced a major review of sentencing. A public consultation was started in 2019 and completed the following year with the overwhelming number of respondents in favour of tougher sentences. In 2021, Justice Minister Naomi Long proposed a change in the law to increase the maximum sentence from 14 year to 20 years. However, the collapse of the Stormont Executive between 2022 and February 2024 has been blamed for the delay in bringing in the new penalties.\n\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, Long said she had \"huge respect\" for the Dolans who she commended for their \"courage and commitment\" throughout their campaign. \u201cI am planning to bring forward a Sentencing Bill which will deliver on a number of the recommendations arising from my department\u2019s public consultation on a review of sentencing policy,\" she said. \u201cIn light of the Dolan family\u2019s campaign, and following significant engagement with them and other families who have been bereaved in similar tragic circumstances, this will include increasing maximum penalties for those convicted of offences causing death or serious injury by driving.\" Long said in addition to raising the maximum sentence from 14 years to 20 years and the introduce a discretionary life sentence for offenders with a previous conviction for a similar offence, it was proposed to increase the minimum period of mandatory disqualification from driving from two to four years. This would rise from three to six years for a repeat offender. \u201cThe absence of a functioning assembly and executive for two years has inevitably had an impact on my department\u2019s legislative programme,\" Long said. \u201cIt is intended that this bill will be introduced during the remainder of this assembly mandate.\u201d",
    "Google introduces new way to search by filming video\n\nGoogle has released a new feature which will allow people to search the internet by taking a video. Video search will let people point their camera at something, ask a question about it, and get search results. Android and iPhone users globally will gain access to the feature from 1700 GMT by enabling \"AI Overviews\" in their Google app, but it will only support English at launch. It is the latest move from the tech giant to change how people search online by utilising artificial intelligence (AI). It comes three months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announced it was trialling the ability to search by asking its chatbot questions. Google introduced AI-generated results at the top of certain search queries this year, with mixed results. In May, the feature drew criticism for providing erratic, inaccurate answers, which included advising people to make cheese stick to pizza by using \"non-toxic glue\". At the time, a Google spokesperson said the issues were \"isolated examples\". The results have since become better, with fewer inaccuracies. Since then, there have been further moves to include AI in search, which included the ability to ask questions about still images using Google Lens. The firm said this feature has increased the popularity of Lens, within its mobile app, which has motivated it to expand the feature further.\n\nGoogle's head of search Liz Reid said the new capability would let people ask questions about the world around them more easily. She gave the example of a person at an aquarium, who might want to find out why a group of fish are swimming in unison. Instead of having to search for the fish online and write out the query, the new feature will let them point their camera, record a short clip and ask a question out loud. Google's AI will analyse the video, identify the fish, combine that with the question and produce search results. Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said this was a \"big thing\" for Google. \"We are now seeing AI in everything and people connect best with visuals,\" he said. \"This latest development further demonstrates new ways of bringing content to life with something like search which is one of the most common tasks carried out on the internet. \"Here lies scope for AI to be truly collaborative and an innovator in everyday life - we are on the brink of AI becoming personalised and unique based upon our usage patterns and habits.\"\n\nAs well as introducing a way to search by video, Google has also released several other updates. It says it has improved its shopping results, which will now incorporate reviews and pricing information from different sellers. And it is also introducing a competitor to the music-identifying app Shazam, which is owned by Apple. The rival tool, accessible through Circle to Search on an Android device, will let people identify songs from a website they're on or a show they're streaming without leaving the app. Google's new features come as it faces growing challengers in the search space, where it is estimated to have cornered more than 90% of the market globally. This includes OpenAI, which revealed in July it was trialling a search feature within ChatGPT. SearchGPT lets people search the internet by asking questions to a chatbot, and it is being tested by a limited number of users in the US. OpenAI's value surged to $157bn (\u00a3120bn) on Wednesday after it raised $6.6bn in its latest funding round from high-profile investors including Microsoft. Google's new announcements are likely a way to combat the growth of rival firms - though none are yet to truly threaten its massive dominance.",
    "Better Ireland still seeking answers after vital win\n\nIreland were never behind against Argentina but survived a late scare in their 22-19 win\n\nSeeking a response to a jarring defeat against the All Blacks seven days prior, Ireland's victory against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium on Friday served to answer some questions while presenting a few more. Andy Farrell called it \"three or four games in one\" and, as such, there was good, bad and ugly in the host's performance. Having taken the lead in the second minute, Ireland were never behind but, after failure to score in the second half, ended the contest against 14 men clinging on to a slender 22-19 advantage. The game had seemed in hand at half-time, yet come the final whistle the overriding emotion in Dublin was one of relief. Without consecutive losses since the opening two fixtures of the 2021 Six Nations, Ireland's response to setbacks has so often been emphatic. Whether it be overcoming a first Test defeat to win the series in New Zealand in 2022, putting their World Cup 2023 heartache behind them with a stirring away win in France to start the most recent Six Nations, or looking decidedly outplayed in the first Test against South Africa this summer only to turn the tables seven days later - Farrell's Ireland have proven masters at lifting themselves from the canvas. But, beaten so decisively by the All Blacks last week when discipline was a massive issue and the attack misfired, rarely in recent times had it felt like there was so much to fix from one game to the next. Prior to kick-off, Farrell said some of his players were \"lucky\" to get the opportunity to atone for their opening autumn performance. When asked after the nerve-shredding 82 minutes if he had got the desired response, he replied \"in parts\".\n\nArgentina, who have now lost all 11 Tests they have played in Dublin, have beaten France, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia in this calendar year alone. As such, they were never likely to allow Ireland to have things solely their own way. But, while there was a slice of luck involved in the way that Matias Moroni's yellow card negated the centre's own early try, Ireland could not have asked for a better platform than two tries in the opening five minutes. A third, as well as a disallowed fourth through Tadhg Beirne, would follow before the turn, but Ireland failed to score a single point across the game's final 48 minutes. Key to ensuring the win required such a dramatic final defensive stand was Irish ill-discipline. While Argentina failed to take advantage of yellow cards for Finlay Bealham and Joe McCarthy, and would see two players sent to the sin bin themselves, Ireland conceded 13 penalties for the second game in succession.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'We had a chance to win ugly, and we did' - Farrell on Argentina win\n\nAfter years of being one of the best drilled sides in world rugby, the referee's whistle is becoming an increasingly prominent issue for this Irish outfit. Across their past three Test matches, they have allowed the opposition 18 successful shots at their posts. \"It's something that we\u2019ve been outstanding on over the last ten years, actually,\" said Farrell. \"But certainly in that amount of time you\u2019re saying there [the past three games], it\u2019s not done out of players going out there to be ill-disciplined. It\u2019s coming from the right place, if that may sound stupid. \"All they\u2019re trying to do is do the right thing by their team, They just need to be a little more patient individually and trust the team and what they\u2019re about.\"\n\nSam Prendergast [left] made his debut off the bench in place of Jack Crowley [right]\n\nIf the most immediate area requiring improvement is readily apparent, the bigger picture remains Ireland's transition from a team for today into one built for tomorrow. One of Farrell's biggest strengths in his role has been as a selector, with his decisions - picking Jamison Gibson-Park and Mack Hansen at times when few were calling for them to start offering just two examples - often proving so prescient that the initial wider doubts have been largely forgotten. Having selected a team so obviously for the present rather than the future against the All Blacks, some quarters were calling for wholesale changes and an infusion of youth. Rather than opt to discard so many of those who had taken the side to number one in the world, the soon-to-be British and Irish Lions head coach rotated minimally for the Pumas, bringing in Robbie Henshaw for Bundee Aki for the only change to the starting side. There was greater upheaval to his bench, with Sam Prendergast, Craig Casey and Ryan Baird included at the expense of Frawley, Conor Murray and Iain Henderson, while the uncapped prop Thomas Clarkson debuted as a replacement with Tadhg Furlong and Tom O'Toole ruled out through injury. The 21-year-old Prendergast and Jamie Osborne, 22, in particular caught the eye in their cameos as Farrell weighs up how best to integrate the next generation into his side moving forward. A side that can beat opposition as good as Argentina even on a day when not firing on all cylinders is not one to be cast aside quickly, and greater rotation is surely in store against Fiji next week, but the pace of such change will remain a source of debate.",

    "Over the span of her law enforcement career, Harris\u2019s allies sought to paint her as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d committed to criminal justice reform but also tough on crime.\n\nIt was a fine line to walk in a liberal city in the country\u2019s largest left-leaning state, and one that critics on both sides of the political aisle say she did not stick to.\n\nAs district attorney, she adopted a so-called \u201csmart-on-crime\u201d philosophy, which included initiatives to keep non-violent offenders out of prison by steering them into job training programs and ensuring young offenders remained in school.\n\nNiki Solis, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office who worked opposite Harris in the early 2000s, said she had been receptive to her concerns about how young victims of sex trafficking were being charged with prostitution, as opposed to being treated as victims.\n\n\u201cI realised that she understood issues that a lot of her predecessors and a lot of [district attorneys] up and down the state failed to understand or even acknowledge,\u201d said Ms Solis.\n\nTrump and his allies on the right have sought to play up this time in her career, depicting her as part of a \u201cSan Francisco liberal elite\u201d. But on the left of politics, she has been accused of not being reform-minded enough, with some on social media nicknaming her \u201cKamala the cop\u201d.\n\nBut by the time Harris was elected as California\u2019s attorney general, in 2010, her progressive tendencies appeared to have given way to political pragmatism.\n\n\"She was seeking more of a national profile. She wanted to make a mark. There was definitely an expectation of an interesting future to come,\u201d said Gil Duran, who worked for Harris in the attorney general\u2019s office for a few months.\n\n\"The attorney general - usually a sleepy backwater of an office - was now home to a rising star.\"\n\nOn the national stage, Harris began to make her mark. In 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Harris threatened to walk away from negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and five US banks. California was set to receive around $4 billion in the initial deal, and Harris eventually secured $18 billion for the state.\n\nThe Harris campaign has highlighted this case on the campaign trail as more proof she\u2019s willing to stand up to powerful interests.\n\nBut more recent reporting shows that only $4.5 billion of the settlement ended up going towards California homeowners who had been ripped off by lenders.\n\nIn moves that angered some liberals, she implemented a school truancy program state-wide, which some county prosecutors used to arrest parents. And she defied a Supreme Court order to reduce overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons.\n\nShe also reversed her previous position on the death penalty in 2014 when, as attorney general, she appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling that found it was unconstitutional. Now, the prosecutor who once refused to sentence violent murderers to death on the basis that \"there is no exception to principle\" was defending the state\u2019s right to do just that.\n\nHadar Aviram, a criminal justice and civil rights professor who petitioned Harris to leave the decision in place, was one of many critics of her stance.\n\n\u201cYou are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,\u201d she told CNN in 2019 of the episode. \u201cIf you truly believe that they\u2019re morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it\u2019s an imperative to do so.\u201d",
    "Leigh Pateman is currently serving a prison term of 17 years and 10 months for the attack on his girlfriend\n\nA man who poured petrol on his girlfriend and set her on fire has pleaded guilty to murder after she died nearly two years on from the attack. Leigh Pateman, 45, doused Ellen Marshall as she sat in a chair at her home in Skegness, Lincolnshire, before setting her alight during an argument on 22 April 2021. She suffered 80% burns, mainly to the top half of her body, and died of her injuries on 11 March 2023.

    "Co-chair Toshiyuki Mimaki, who survived the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was tearful after it was announced Nihon Hidankyo had won\n\nNihon Hidankyo, a Japanese group of atomic bomb survivors, has won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize. Known as hibakusha, the survivors of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been recognised by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Nobel Committee Chair Joergen Watne Frydnes said the group had \"contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo\". Mr Frydnes warned the \"nuclear taboo\" was now \"under pressure\" - and praised the group's use of witness testimony to ensure nuclear weapons must never be used again.\n\nFounded in 1956, the organisation sends survivors around the world to share their testimonies of the \"atrocious damage\" and suffering caused by the use of nuclear weapons, according to its website. Their work began almost a decade after the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 6 August 1945, a US bomber dropped the uranium bomb above the city of Hiroshima, killing around 140,000 people. Three days later a second nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan's surrender, announced by Emperor Hirohito shortly afterwards, ended World War Two. Speaking to reporters in Japan, a tearful Toshiyuki Mimaki, the co-head of the group, said: \"Never did I dream this could happen,\" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. Mr Mimaki criticised the idea that nuclear weapons bring peace. \"It has been said that because of nuclear weapons, the world maintains peace. But nuclear weapons can be used by terrorists,\" Mr Mimaki said, according to reports by AFP. In a BBC interview last year, he said despite only being three years old at the time the nuclear bomb hit Hiroshima - he could still remember dazed and burnt survivors fleeing past his home. The prize - which consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a sum of $1m (\u00a3765,800) - will be presented at a ceremonies in Oslo in December, marking the anniversary of the death of the scientist and prize creator Alfred Nobel. The group has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize \"many times\" in the past, including in 2005 when it received a special mention by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, its website says.\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial building was the only structure left standing in the area after the first atomic bomb was dropped in 1945\n\nThe decision to recognise Nihon Hidankyo means the Nobel committee has steered away from more controversial nominees for the peace prize. There had been widespread speculation the United Nations agency supporting Palestinians \u2013 UNRWA \u2013 was being considered for the prize. Although the organisation is the main provider of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, nine of its members were fired for alleged involvement in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 last year. More than 12,000 people had signed a petition urging the committee not to award UNRWA the prize. There were equal concerns about the nomination of the International Court of Justice. The UN\u2019s main judicial organ is currently considering allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and has already issued a statement urging the Israeli authorities to refrain from genocidal acts. But while giving the prize to Nihon Hidankyo may be a non-controversial choice, it could also focus global attention on the threat of nuclear conflict which overshadows the fighting in both Ukraine and the Middle East. Throughout Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, its leaders have repeatedly hinted that they may be ready to use tactical nuclear weapons if western allies increase their support for Ukraine in a way Russia considers unacceptable. These threats have succeeded in restraining western support for fear of escalation. In the Middle East, the subtext for much of Israel\u2019s strategy is the fear that Iran is seeking nuclear capability, something Tehran denies. The Nobel committee\u2019s decision may renew a debate about the use of nuclear weapons at a time when some countries look enviously at their deterring power. This year's peace prize had 286 nominations, a number comprising 197 individuals and 89 organisations. Nominations can be made by people in positions of significant authority, including members of national assemblies, governments and international courts of law. Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi won the prize in 2023, when she was honoured for her work fighting the oppression of women in Iran. Ms Mohammadi is currently being held in Evin prison in Tehran, having already spent 12 years in jail serving multiple sentences related to her activism.",

    "In County Durham, the pilot scheme has helped enrol 2,500 children for free school meals\n\nThousands more children from England\u2019s poorest households are eating a free school meal because of a new trial scheme. The pilot project, run by the Fix Our Food research programme and involving dozens of councils, is identifying previously unregistered eligible children and automatically enrolling them. Families who qualify for free school meals usually have to register their children to get a meal, even if they meet the criteria. The Department for Education has encouraged all eligible families who are not automatically enrolled to register.\n\nThe total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population. Some families do not sign up for free school meals they are entitled to because of language barriers, not understanding the eligibility criteria or because of a stigma around sharing financial information. In England, families are eligible to apply for free school meals, external if they are on universal credit and have a household income below \u00a37,400 per year, after tax. One estimate, by thinktank Policy in Practice, external, suggests there could be an additional 470,000 families who meet the free school meal criteria but are not registered.\n\nSixth former Mirzan, from north London, has been registered for free school meals since he started Year 7. Having previously missed meals himself, he says he worries about what unregistered children are eating at school. \"Someone I knew in school, the only meal they'd receive that day would be their free school meal. So I know what impact it has,\" he says. \"Instead of sitting there looking at the board trying to solve the algebra problem, you're sitting thinking, 'When I get home, what am I going to eat?'\"\n\nMirzan, 18, is an ambassador for the Food Foundation charity\n\nResearchers from Fix Our Food, a programme based in York, say they want the government to automatically enrol families who are missing out nationwide, by allowing them to opt out instead of having to opt in. They say it saves families \u00a3500 per year in lunch costs. Fix Our Food has helped about 20 local authorities implement the trial scheme so far. About 20,000 eligible children who were previously missing out have been enrolled, according to surveys looking at the scheme's impact, says Myles Bremner from the project.\n\nMyles Bremner says the government has all the data it needs to help councils automatically enrol eligible families more easily\n\nAn additional 40 councils are working with Fix Our Food to look at whether they could also implement the scheme, he says. The additional registrations have also brought in millions of pounds in vital extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants, according to Fix Our Food. Schools get \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil on free school meals, per year, for at least six years. Marvin Charles, head teacher at City Heights E-Act Secondary Academy in Lambeth, south London, says he uses the additional funding for residential trips or extra tuition and mentoring. More than half of his pupils were already registered for free school meals - more than double the national average - but the automatic enrolment scheme found 15 more who met the criteria but had not been receiving them.\n\nMarvin Charles says he's pleased his students are now guaranteed the hot meal they are entitled to\n\nBut the scheme requires a lot of paperwork and digging through data for the councils who implement it to establish which families are eligible. Fix Our Food says it wants the government to bring together datasets from different government departments to make the process quicker and easier. MPs could soon be debating the issue in parliament, after it was introduced via a private members' bill, external on 16 October. The government says it is looking at long-term solutions to child poverty but has not committed to rolling out the scheme nationwide. A spokesperson said one of the first priorities was providing free breakfast clubs in primary schools, which is expected to roll out to the first 750 schools in April 2025. All children in England get a free school meal up to Year 2. In Wales and in London, all primary school children automatically get a free school meal but eligible secondary pupils still have to apply. In Scotland, external, all pupils up to P5, the equivalent of England's Year 4, get a free school meal. Families are eligible for free school meals after that point if they are on universal credit and earn less than \u00a3796 per month, or around \u00a39,500 per year. In Northern Ireland, external, the threshold is \u00a315,000 per year, after tax.\n\nSign up here to receive our new weekly newsletter.",
    "Diddy is facing both civil and criminal lawsuits in the US\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses in his upcoming sex trafficking trial, prosecutors have alleged. The music mogul is accused of making \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\", by using other inmates' telephone accounts, and using three-way calls to speak to people who are not on his approved contacts list. Prosecutors said a review of recorded calls also found that Mr Combs instructed his family to contact potential witnesses in his case, they said in a court filing. The 55-year-old rapper, who has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and vehemently denied any wrongdoing, appeared in court on Tuesday as a judge weighed the new evidence, part of which was found in a notebook in his jail cell.\n\nAt the hearing on Tuesday, a judge ordered that prosecutors destroy copies of materials seized in Mr Combs' jail cell as the judge weighed whether they could be used in court. Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing the case, ruled that the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York cannot use the material or any excerpts from it during Combs\u2019 upcoming bail hearing on Friday. The judge said he would examine the materials and weigh in on whether that can be used at trial. Mr Combs\u2019 defence team claimed that government prosecutors illegally seized his personal notes during a search of his jail cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he has been detained since his arrest on 16 September in the lobby of a Manhattan hotel. They argued some of the materials detailed information that is protected under attorney-client privilege, which shields information discussed between a client and an attorney. The government detailed that a \"filter\" team went through all materials before they were given to prosecutors. \"The information at issue is not protected,\" prosecutor Mary Slavik said at the hearing. They argued the information could be considered obstruction of justice and negate the typical protections of attorney-client privilege. The musician, who is best known for 1990s hits such as I'll Be Missing You and Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, has been denied bail since his arrest, with multiple judges citing a risk that he might tamper with witnesses. He's currently in custody in Manhattan. His lawyers made a renewed bid for bail last week, proposing a $50m (\u00a339.6m) package that would see Mr Combs be monitored around the clock by security personnel, while under house arrest. Lawyer Alexandra Shapiro argued it was impossible for the musician to prepare for trial from behind bars because of the \"incredibly voluminous\" amount of material to review, especially without a laptop computer. She also said his preparation has been hampered by conditions at the jail, including frequent lockdowns and officers taking away the pens he uses to take notes. Detention is stripping Mr Combs of \"any real opportunity\" to be ready for trial, violating his rights under the US Constitution, Shapiro said. In response, prosecutors argued that the request for bail should be denied, alleging that Mr Combs \"poses serious risks of danger and obstruction of these proceedings\".\n\nThe musician was previously denied bail at court hearing in September\n\nIn court documents, they accused the star of orchestrating social media posts in order to \"influence a potential jury pool\" at his trial. Amongst those efforts, they cited an Instagram statement posted by a woman known only as \"witness two\", countering allegations made by singer Dawn Richard in a civil lawsuit against Mr Combs. Prosecutors alleged that her statement was drafted with Mr Combs during \"multiple texts\" and \"multiple calls\" from prison. They further alleged there was a \"strong inference\" that Mr Combs \"paid witness two, after she posted her statement\".\n\u2022 None The parties that led to Diddy's downfall\n\u2022 None Diddy's trial: When does it start, and what happens next?\n\u2022 None Chaos reigns - the notorious jail where Diddy is being held A video posted by the star's seven children on 5 November was also cited as evidence of a \"public relations strategy to influence this case\". The video, which was reported by multiple media outlets, showed the family wishing Mr Combs a happy birthday during a prison phone call. \"The defendant then monitored the analytics - ie audience engagement - and explicitly discussed with his family how to ensure that the video had his desired effect on potential jury members in this case,\" prosecutors said.\n\nSean Combs (back row, third from left) poses with his seven children, in a photo he posted on Instagram in March 2023\n\nMr Combs was also accused of using the phone accounts of at least eight other inmates to make calls, which is against prison regulations; and of \"directing others\" to orchestrate payment for this access. Prosecutors characterised Mr Combs as running a \"relentless\" scheme to \"contact potential witnesses, including victims of his abuse who could provide powerful testimony against him\".\n\nUrging the judge to deny Mr Combs' request for bail, the prosecutors wrote that \"no set of conditions\" could eliminate the potential risks to the trial. \"The defendant has demonstrated an uncanny ability to get others to do his bidding - employees, family members, and [prison] inmates alike,\" they claimed. \"There is no reason to believe that private security personnel would be immune.\" Prosecutors also rejected criticism of the conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, citing an interview, external from the star's lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who said \"food\u2019s probably the roughest part\" of Mr Combs' adjustment to life behind bars. The BBC has contacted his legal team for a response.\n\nCassie and Diddy in 2017. She later accused him of abuse and exploitation.\n\nMr Combs' legal troubles began last November, when his ex-partner Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura filed a civil lawsuit, alleging incidents of rape and physical assault between 2007 and 2018. Although the case was quickly settled out of court, it led to a flurry of similar accusations and an investigation by the US Government. The star's properties were raided by federal agents in March, and he was arrested in New York in September. Mr Combs was charged with three counts of sex trafficking and racketeering, in a federal indictment that described allegations of drug-fuelled, days-long sexual performances dubbed as \"Freak Offs\". The musician is simultaneously facing more than two dozen civil cases by men and women accusing him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. The star has vehemently denied all of the charges against him, and the claims in the civil suits, arguing that the sexual encounters at the heart of his criminal case were all consensual.\n\nIn a separate development on Monday, two separate lawsuits were filed against one of the lawyers known for spearheading more than 120 lawsuits against Mr Combs. One lawsuit, filed by an unnamed \"high-profile individual\" against Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, alleged that Mr Buzbee attempted to extort him by threatening to make public \u201centirely fabricated and malicious allegations of sexual assault\". In court documents obtained by the BBC, the plaintiff identified himself as a former associate of Diddy and acknowledged attending events with the embattled music mogul. The lawsuit against Mr Buzbee claims the Houston attorney follows a \"clear playbook\" for extorting celebrities involving fabricating allegations and demanding letters seeking payment. The lawsuit alleges that if the demands are not met, he turns to the media to apply public pressure. Mr Buzbee, who denies wrongdoing, described the filing as a \u201clast-ditch attempt\u201d to stop him from naming the individual. \u201cIt is obvious that the frivolous lawsuit filed against my firm is an aggressive attempt to intimidate or silence me and ultimately my clients,\u201d he said in a statement sent to the BBC. \"No amount of money was included in the demand letters,\" he wrote. \"No threats were made. The demand letters sent are no different than the ones routinely sent by lawyers across the country in all types of cases.\u201d A second legal claim was filed Monday, by an unnamed woman, in New York alleging abusive behaviour toward women. The summons states Mr Buzbee abused his power as an attorney and violated the3 unnamed woman while representing her as a client. \u201cPlaintiff brings these causes of action to address Defendant's misconduct, which began with his assault of Plaintiff and escalated during his representation of her in divorce proceedings, where he prioritized concealing his actions over safeguarding her legal interests,\u201d the claim states. In a statement to the BBC, the attorney who filed the suit, Jeremy Bohrer called Mr Buzbee a hypocrite. \u201cThere is nothing worse than when a black hat masquerades as a white hat.\u201d Mr Buzbee has not yet responded to the second lawsuit. BBC News has reached out for comment.",
    "Manager Duncan Ferguson has been working for free as the club fights for survival\n\nDuncan Ferguson has been sacked as the manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle. The club is fighting for its survival after entering administration due to a financial crisis. Ferguson, who had been working for free, said he and two coaches had been let go by the club. Other players and staff are expected to hear if they still have jobs on Thursday. Administrators BDO said they were working to \"secure the long term future\" of the Highland team.\n\nEarlier, Ferguson told BBC Scotland News he had \"always been against administration\". After being let go, the former Scotland international said: \u201cI\u2019ve done the very best I can for my club and for my players. \"I\u2019ve always tried to support my players behind the scenes and they all know that. And that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d He described the process of administration as \u201cbrutal\u201d, but said that he had enjoyed his time at the club.\n\nThe club confirmed that Ferguson, assistant manager Gary Bollan and goalkeeping coach Stuart Garden had left with immediate effect. In a statement, it said: \"The club would like to place on record our thanks to Duncan, Gary and Stuart for their efforts and wish them the very best in the future. \"Scott Kellacher, first team coach, is stepping up to take over as first team head coach with immediate effect.\"\n\nInverness have had 15 points deducted as a result of administration, meaning they face potential relegation from League 1. They now sit bottom, on -3 points. Regardless of what division they are in next season, they will start on -5 points. Ferguson joined Inverness last September following the sacking of Billy Dodds, with the club sitting bottom of the Championship at the time. Caley Thistle were later relegated in a play-off against Hamilton Accies. A former Dundee United, Rangers, Everton and Newcastle United player, Ferguson was appointed to his first full managerial role at Forest Green Rovers last year.\n\nFormer chairman Alan Savage says he is confident the club can be saved\n\nAdministrators are attempting to find new owners to rescue the club. If that fails, assets could be sold and the money raised distributed to creditors. Investor Alan Savage, a former club chairman, told BBC Scotland News he would give it his \"best shot\" to help save the club. Asked if he was confident it could be saved, he replied: \u201cOf course I am yeah.\u201d Savage pledged to help anyone who lost their job to find a new one. Asked about his own potential role at the club if it survives administration, he said: \"It\u2019s a step by step process and until we\u2019ve gone through those steps it\u2019s a bit early to say.\u201d",

    "Emergency deal fails to get toddler out of Lebanon\n\nDavid has been in Lebanon with his father for the past two years\n\nAn emergency deal to get Belfast toddler David Nahle on a UK evacuation flight out of war-torn Beirut has failed. The High Court has agreed to drop an arrest order against David\u2019s father, Dr Mustapha Nahle, if he allows the child to board a flight to the UK. But a special mediator who flew to the Lebanese capital to try to bring David home says Dr Nahle has so far refused to accept the arrangement. The mediator, Mice\u00e1l O\u2019Hurley, called on the British and Irish prime ministers to make a direct appeal to their Lebanese counterpart.\n\nCatherine Flanagan last saw her son in person when he was ten months old\n\nDr Nahle has kept David, who turns three next week, in Beirut since 2022. David travelled there with his mother Catherine Flanagan on a British passport, but Dr Nahle refused to let him leave again and as a result is a fugitive from UK authorities. He has refused to obey a UK court order for David\u2019s return, saying a Lebanese court has granted him custody. As violence in Lebanon escalated this week, the High Court in Belfast granted an urgent order which offered to stay a charge of contempt against Dr Nahle if he allowed David to evacuate. Mr O\u2019Hurley flew to the Beirut on Wednesday and had secured a seat for the Belfast-born child on a plane carrying evacuees on Thursday \u2013 but that flight took off without him.\n\nMr O\u2019Hurley told BBC News NI he was in phone contact with Dr Nahle but he has so far rejected the deal. \u201cI regret that I was unable to evacuate David from Beirut,\u201d Mr O\u2019Hurley said. \u201cThe cooperation required to see David home was not forthcoming by his father in Lebanon. \u201cStill, I pray to God another opportunity to evacuate David will arise.\u201d\n\nBecause David is a citizen of the UK, Ireland and Lebanon, Mr O\u2019Hurley called on the prime ministers of the three countries to become involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked that Prime Minister Starmer and an Taoiseach Simon Harris telephone their counterpart, Najib Mikati to request his assistance with David\u2019s evacuation.\u201d A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was providing consular assistance and was in contact with local authorities in Lebanon. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said it is aware of the case and has provided advice and guidance. BBC Spotlight tracked down David\u2019s father in Beirut last month and he told the programme he did not intend to allow his son to leave Lebanon. The latest development comes days after Israel launched an invasion of Lebanon. Attacks in southern Beirut, where it is believed David is living with his father, killed nine people overnight. Israel has warned people in dozens of places in southern Lebanon to evacuate.\n\nSpotlight: My Son In A Warzone is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.",
    "Rebekah Vardy has been ordered to pay Coleen Rooney \u00a3100,000 this month towards the money she owes following the high-profile 2022 Wagatha Christie libel case. After losing the case, Mrs Vardy was ordered to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's legal costs. At the trial, the judge ruled it was \"substantially true\" that Mrs Vardy had leaked Mrs Rooney's private information to the press. Barristers for the pair have been back at the High Court this week in a dispute over the costs, which were originally agreed at \u00a3540,779 - but have ended up being \u00a31.8m, more than three times that figure.\n\nMrs Vardy\u2019s lawyers launched a new case arguing that Mrs Rooney has no entitlement to \u00a3120,000 of the costs, and that her lawyers committed misconduct by \"deliberately\" understating her legal bill during the 2022 case. Disputes were raised over costs for one of Mrs Rooney's lawyers, with claims that they had stayed at a luxury hotel and run up a large mini-bar bill. But in a ruling on Tuesday, senior costs judge Andrew Gordon-Saker dismissed a number of Mrs Vardy\u2019s claims and ruled that Mrs Rooney\u2019s team had not committed any misconduct, and therefore it was \"not an appropriate case\" to reduce the amount Mrs Vardy had to pay. He said that while there was a \"failure to be transparent\", it was not \"sufficiently unreasonable or improper\" to constitute misconduct. However, it is likely that Mrs Vardy will pay less than the estimated \u00a31.6m she was instructed to pay, because the case is set to return to court next year for a line-by-line assessment, with some rulings yet to be made.\n\nA judge has ruled Coleen Rooney's lawyers did not commit misconduct\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Gordon-Saker ruled that some of the hourly fees charged by Mrs Rooney's lawyers had been too high. Jamie Carpenter, representing Mrs Vardy, said that \"we simply don't know at the moment how much is in this bill that shouldn't be\", but there were certainly costs that \"shouldn't\" be there. At the end of the hearing on Wednesday, Mr Gordon-Saker said the case would return to court by next spring at the earliest. He added: \"The parties need to get on with this and put it behind them.\" Mrs Rooney's lawyer, Robin Dunne, requested a further payment towards the bill. He said Mrs Vardy had paid \u00a3800,000 so far, as ordered following the 2022 ruling, and requested an additional \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000. Mr Gordon-Saker ordered Mrs Vardy to pay a further \u00a3100,000 within 21 days. He said: \"I think there is some scope for a further payment on account so the defendant [Mrs Rooney] is not kept out of her costs, and I think that should be no more than \u00a3100,000.\" This marks the end of a set of preliminary issues. The line-by-line assessment of costs will decide the total amount of money to be paid. It has been five years since Mrs Rooney, the wife of ex-England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, claimed on social media that Mrs Vardy's account had been the source of three stories in the Sun. At the trial in July 2022, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled it was likely Mrs Vardy \"knew of, condoned and was actively engaged\" in the process of leaking stories about Mrs Rooney to the newspaper in collaboration with her agent, Caroline Watt.",
    "New flight chartered for Britons to leave Lebanon\n\nThe UK government is chartering another flight for British nationals to leave Lebanon on Sunday, as it urges people to exit the country which is gripped by conflict. More than 250 UK citizens have already left on chartered flights. As of Friday morning, more than 2,000 British nationals had registered their presence in the country, the Foreign Office said. The flight will be the fourth specially organised by the government. British nationals who have registered their presence will be sent details on how to request a seat. The Foreign Office said there were no more scheduled flights because of a \"decrease in demand\". However, the situation will be kept under constant review.\n\nAs of last month, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. \"Based on our contacts so far, we also anticipate that only a fraction want to leave due to their strong ties in the country,\" the Foreign Office added.

    "Big taxes will be imposed on imports of electric vehicles from China to the EU after the majority of member states backed the plans. The move to introduce tariffs aims to protect the European car industry from being undermined by what EU politicians believe are unfair Chinese-state subsidies on its own cars. Tariffs on electric cars made in China are set to rise from 10% to up to 45% for the next five years, but there have been concerns such a move could raise electric vehicle (EV) prices for buyers. The decision, which split EU member states such as France and Germany, risks sparking a trade war between Brussels and Beijing, which has condemned the tariffs as protectionist.\n\nChina has been counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy and the EU is the largest overseas market for the country's electric car industry. Its domestic car industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades and its brands, such as BYD, have begun moving into international markets, prompting fears from the likes of the EU that its own companies will be unable to compete with the cheaper prices. The EU imposed import tariffs of varying levels on different Chinese manufacturers in the summer, but Friday's vote was to decide if they were implemented for the next five years. The charges were calculated based on estimates of how much Chinese state aid each manufacturer has received following an EU investigation. The European Commission set individual duties on three major Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. EU members were divided on tariffs. Germany, whose car manufacturing industry is heavily dependent on exports to China, was against them. Many EU members abstained in the vote. German carmakers have been vocal in opposition. Volkswagen says tariffs are \"the wrong approach\". However, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland were reported to have backed the import taxes. The tariffs proposal could only have been blocked if a qualified majority of 15 members voted against it. Germany's top industry association, BDI, called on the European Union and China to continue trade talks over tariffs to avoid an \"escalating trade conflict\". The European Commission, which held the vote, said the EU and China would \"work hard to explore an alternative solution\" to the import taxes to address what it called \"injurious subsidisation\" of Chinese electric vehicles. China's Commerce Ministry called the decision to impose tariffs \"unfair\" and \"unreasonable\", but added the issue could be resolved through negotiations. The dispute has raised fears among industry groups outside the car sector that they could face retaliatory tariffs from China. A trade body for the French cognac industry said the French authorities \"have abandoned us\". \"We do not understand why our sector is being sacrificed in this way.\" It said a negotiated solution needed to be found that would \"prevent our products from facing a surtax that could exclude them from the Chinese market\".\n\nFigures show that in August this year, EU registrations of battery-electric cars fell by 43.9% from a year earlier. In the UK, demand for new electric vehicles hit a new record in September, but orders were mostly driven by commercial deals and by big manufacturer discounts, according to the industry trade body. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said firms had \"serious concerns as the market is not growing quickly enough to meet mandated targets\". The industry has warned that drivers need better incentives to buy electric to help manufacturers ahead of the planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles. Under the Conservative government the deadline for this ban was pushed back to 2035 from 2030, but Labour has pledged to bring it back to 2030. Car makers are required to meet electric vehicle sales targets. Under the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, at least 22% of vehicles sold this year must be zero-emission, with the target expected to hit 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Manufacturers that fail to hit quotas could be fined \u00a315,000 per car. The bosses of several car companies, including BMW, Ford and Nissan, wrote to Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Friday saying the industry was likely to miss these targets. They said economic factors such as higher energy and material costs and interest rates had meant electric cars remained \"stubbornly more expensive and consumers are wary of investing\". The average cost to buy an electric car in the UK is around \u00a348,000., external They said a \"lack of confidence\" in the UK\u2019s charging infrastructure was another barrier to encourage people to switch to electric.",
    "What being coached by Murray could do for Djokovic\n\nAndy Murray and Novak Djokovic played doubles together at the 2006 Australian Open\n\nAndy Murray hiring Ivan Lendl and Novak Djokovic appointing Boris Becker were two breathtaking moments of surprise. But the news that Murray will coach Djokovic at January's Australian Open may cause even more exhilaration. I am sure I am not the only one who checked the date, to make absolutely certain it was not 1 April. These two are only seven days apart in age, and shared the court in seven Grand Slam singles finals. Friends as juniors, they became rivals as seniors. There was many a heated moment along the way but, helped by a shared history, they mostly seemed to get along pretty well. \"Never even liked tennis anyway,\" Murray posted on the day he retired from playing. \"He never liked retirement anyway,\" Djokovic posted on the day the Scot began his coaching career. Djokovic has frequently worked with Grand Slam champions in a career which has so far returned 24 major titles. There were three years with Becker, six with Goran Ivanisevic and a less productive year in the company of Andre Agassi. Djokovic said Becker was someone he would \"look to for eye contact in the tough moments\". Agassi's skill, he said, was distilling complex concepts into precise information and reminding him how good he is. Boris Bosnjakovic, who previously ran the Novak Tennis Centre, has been minding the ship since Ivanisevic left in March. But another appointment always seemed likely as 37-year-old Djokovic heads into 2025 trying to break the hold Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have on the Grand Slam titles.\n\nMurray's presence will very likely prove a stimulus, and his reading of the game and analysis of other players when competing suggests he has the makings of an outstanding coach. \"Andy's very sharp with the data side of things and the strategy,\" Murray's coach of six years Jamie Delgado told BBC Sport. \"You have got to remember that Andy has played against Novak many times, so he will know and express to Novak what makes him so difficult to play against, remind him of those things that his opponents will be feeling when they play against him. \"Novak has now got different rivals in front of him - Sinner and Alcaraz - and Andy's played these guys himself, so in terms of getting that final few per cent to make a difference in matches from a strategy point of view, you would be hard pushed to find someone better than Andy.\"\n\nAndy Murray lost four Australian Open finals and one semi-final to Novak Djokovic\n\nThe most surprising part is the timing. Murray only retired from playing four months ago. That time has been shared between his family and his golf clubs, but as he told the Control the Controllables podcast last year, if his children are at school, he is often bored by Wednesday lunchtime. The opportunity to work with Djokovic is unlikely to come around again and, having lost four Melbourne finals to the Serb, he may think he will never have a better chance to win the Australian Open. Joking aside, there do not appear to be many downsides. Djokovic has not currently entered any events before the Australian Open, so Murray should be free to enjoy the Christmas holiday at home after some work together during the off-season. Their Melbourne practice sessions will be box office, and it will be enthralling to see how their relationship develops and whether Murray could be a feature of Djokovic's team at some of the year's other Grand Slams. \"They always got on well, but I don't think it would have been as close as it maybe was when they were younger - or it would be now,\" Delgado says of their relationship. \"There was just so much on the line. But they had immense respect for each other. \"Andy always spoke so highly of his [Djokovic's] game and how difficult it was to play against him. The respect was sky high.\" The final great act in their playing rivalry was the race to be the year-end world number one in 2016. \"When me and Novak speak with each other, we don't talk about tennis, rankings, the matches we play against each other,\" Murray said earlier that year. \"Maybe when we finish playing, that might change.\"\n\n...but Murray triumphed over Djokovic in a memorable Wimbledon final in 2013",
    "Conservative leadership hopeful Tom Tugendhat has warned against his party becoming Reform UK, as he made his pitch to party members. Speaking from the main stage at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Tugendhat said the Tories needed to \"rebuild trust\" with the public, after the party's historic election defeat in July. Rival leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch said she was prepared to work with Nigel Farage's party in Parliament but ruled out an electoral pact. Tugendhat and Badenoch were the first contenders to speak in the main hall, with Robert Jenrick and James Cleverly getting their chance on Tuesday.\n\nBoth candidates were interviewed by GB News political editor Christopher Hope, before taking questions from party members. Elsewhere, Cleverly told a fringe meeting Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan was an \"error\". The slogan referred to the Conservative government\u2019s efforts to curb the number of people trying to reach the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats. Cleverly, who later used the phrase numerous times when he was home secretary, said it \"distilled a very, very complicated and challenging problem into a soundbite\". When even one boat crossing could be deemed \"a failure\", it was \"an unachievable target\", he added.\n\nIn July the Tories suffered their worst general election defeat in the party's parliamentary history, losing votes to both the Liberal Democrats on the left and Reform UK on the right. Asked whether the Lib Dems or Reform were the biggest enemy, Tugendhat, who is from the centrist One Nation wing of the party, said: \"The enemy is trust. We have eroded trust in ourselves and we need to rebuild trust in the Conservative Party.\" He argued people did not vote for Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey or Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to become prime minister. \"They voted against us. People woke up in the morning and they wanted to get us out,\" he added. Asked whether he would do a deal with Mr Farage, he said: \"My job is to reform the Conservative Party not to become Reform.\" When the same questions were put to Badenoch, she said \"anyone who's not a Conservative has got to be defeated\". She argued Reform politicians were not \"real Conservatives\" and \"not serious people\" but that Reform voters \"are our people\". Pressed over whether she would do a deal with Farage's party, she said: \"I am always prepared to work with any other party that wants to help us deliver our agenda. I think that's fine in Parliament, but in an election, no.\" She added: \"At the next election we have to be the centre-right option. If we split that vote, we are going to be out of power for another five years and Labour will destroy this country.\" At a fringe event later, Badenoch accused Reform of \"squatting\" on Tory territory and \"parking their tanks on our lawn\" - and pledged to fight the party along with Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. She promised to defend Conservatism and to renew her party by offering change and \"telling people the truth in a compelling way\".\n\nDuring the session Tugendhat, a former officer in the Territorial Army who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, repeatedly highlighted his military background, saying \"my entire life has been about public service\". However, he was challenged over whether he was the most inexperienced candidate, given the only government role he has previously held is security minister. Tugendhat shrugged off the question with a dig at his rivals\u2019 lack of military record, saying: \"I'm not going to hold against anybody their inexperience in combat or their inexperience in foreign affairs. \"I won't hold against them the areas where they didn't serve their country and put their lives on the line. They have served in other ways and I think we should respect that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Badenoch faced questions about her suggestion on Sunday that maternity pay had \"gone too far\". The shadow housing secretary insisted she had been answering a different question and that \"maternity pay is quite important\". She added that her comments were part of a \"long discussion about the role of the state in deciding what businesses should do\".",
    "Cian Healy won his 133rd Irish cap against Argentina last Friday\n\nWhen Brian O'Driscoll won his 133rd and final Ireland cap against France in the Six Nations finale of 2014, it was a record that figured to stand the test of time. The legendary centre had made his Test debut as a 20-year-old in the summer of 1999, pulling on a green jersey before he had even represented the senior Leinster side and going on to enjoy a 15-year international career. While Paul O'Connell, Rory Best, Johnny Sexton, Keith Earls and Peter O'Mahony all hit three figures in the years since, none ever felt likely to seriously trouble O'Driscoll's place in the record books. In the end, his tally was matched against Argentina last Friday by a player who, due to a serious neck injury, had signed retirement papers sat on his desk just one year after O'Driscoll himself had hung up his boots. For Cian Healy, who is expected to become the most capped player in Irish rugby history against Fiji on Saturday, the feat is all the more remarkable for the injuries he overcame to continue playing beyond his 37th birthday last month. Indeed, the man himself modestly says the key to sticking around at international level since 2009 has been \"durability\". \"It's very different between Drico [O\u2019Driscoll] and me,\" he said. \"I wasn't ever and will never be the player that he was, so it is separated in that immediately. \"I take pride in the durability and being able to show up. That's something I do hold myself to a bit, not missing training sessions and enjoying the hard work of week in and week out, year in and year out. I have enjoyed that.\"\n\nHealy, who also surpassed Devin Toner's Leinster appearance record in September, admits he tries to block out any \"personal stuff\" from his match preparations, adding that his 100th cap against France in the 2020 Six Nations was \"probably the worst week\" of his career. Those around him, though, are quick to shower him in superlatives. \"He hates it but he has to let us celebrate it,\" said head coach Andy Farrell who called Healy a \"world-leading loose-head\" and a \"legend of our squad\". The head coach, who first encountered Healy on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia in 2013, also noted how valuable his experience has been to younger props. One such younger player is Andrew Porter, who switched back to loose-head in 2021, having first appeared for Ireland on the other side of the scrum. \u201cWhen I first came in, Churchy [Healy] was the best - still is, I\u2019d argue - loose-head in the world,\u201d said Porter. \u201cI owe a lot to him in my own development. He took me under his wing and showed me the ropes.\"\n\nHealy and O'Driscoll spent five years as Irish team-mates\n\nWhile Porter has played on both the loose and the tight for Ireland, Healy has the distinction of having appeared right across the front-row, having been pressed into emergency action at hooker against Scotland in the Six Nations of 2023. Ireland scrum coach John Fogarty still marvels at how he held his own in a new position at Murrayfield. \"The day we played against Scotland I'm in panic mode, because the two hookers go down and we're asking Cian to go into hooker, not knowing what's going to happen. \"But he's clear in his mind he's going to be competitive. \"To step into an international rugby game as a hooker, it says so much about him - we got two scrum penalties that day.\" Fogarty calls Healy \"unique\" for possessing the physical attributes to succeed on either side of the scrum even at international level. \"He has an ability at loose-head to get to a really good hip height so he can launch into tight-heads, but he's got the overall strength and the hip strength as a tight-head that means he can stay in a good strong position to put pressure on a loose-head. \"He's got a range of abilities but what connects them is his mentality. \"He's an exceptional guy, isn't he? His mindset, his mentality, is different to the majority. He's an incredible competitor and that sets him apart.\" \"Unique\" is Porter's choice of adjective too, although in this case referring to Healy's character, while both he and Fogarty agree further on the fact that, even at 37-years-old, there are a few more caps to come. \"He's a huge asset to both Leinster and Ireland and he'll continue to be, it's not his last game. \"He's a great fella and it's great to be able to share the day with him. Hopefully he can push that on and add a few more to it.\"",
    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has warned that Russia is stepping up attacks on Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea \u2013 delaying the export of agricultural produce, including aid intended for Palestinians caught up in the conflict with Israel. During several days of strikes in early October, Russian weapons hit at least four cargo ships, including one reportedly carrying 6,000 tonnes of corn. Sir Keir said that Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was willing \u201cto gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission\u201d. The prime minister's remarks came as he travels to the Pacific Island of Samoa for a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government.\n\nDuring several days of strikes, Russian missile strikes on the Odesa region hit a Panamanian-registered ship and a Palau-flagged cargo ship were also attacked, killing one person on-board. Several people in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia were injured as 29 homes were destroyed and pictures released by regional officials show a giant crater in the mud, with bricks and wood strewn all around. A wave of strikes on Ukraine's Black Sea ports coincided with a European tour by President Volodymyr Zelensky - who visited leaders in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin. But Sir Keir pointed out the increasing number of Russian attacks coincided with harvest season. Despite the war, Ukraine is still a significant supplier of agricultural goods. But British intelligence suggests a growth in what officials call Russian \"risk appetite\u201d when attacking Ukrainian ports \u2013 with grain ships becoming what is described as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in Russia\u2019s campaign. Sir Keir said the \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d were \u201charming millions of vulnerable people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East\u201d. According to Ukrainian figures, more than 20 civilian ships have now been damaged in Russian attacks since the start of the war in 2022. Grain silos and other port infrastructure have been badly damaged too. However, Ukraine has succeeded in creating a maritime corridor to ensure the safety of grain exports, after Moscow pulled out of a Black Sea grain deal last year. Some 962,000 tonnes of grain were exported in the first ten days of October, according to the agriculture ministry in Kyiv - double the volume shipped in the same period last year. Speaking to journalists travelling with him to Samoa, Sir Keir said Russia\u2019s recent recruitment of troops from North Korea was \u201can embarrassing and desperate act. On Tuesday, the British government announced that it would give Ukraine an extra \u00a32.26bn using the profits from Russian assets held in Europe. The one-off payment is an addition to \u00a33bn already pledged by the government to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort. So far, the UK has given more than \u00a312bn in military aid and has promised to match that level of support in the future. Announcing the funding, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK's support for Ukraine was \"unwavering and will remain for as long as it takes\".",
    "Gaza\u2019s only concert grand piano becomes image of hope\n\nThe piano was photographed - a few months into the Israel-Gaza war - in a Gazan music school\n\nThere is one image that keeps a Gaza musician going like no other - that of the territory\u2019s only concert grand piano. Khamis Abu Shaban had finally risked returning to the music school at which he taught - and which owns the piano - a few months into the current conflict. What he saw, at the Gaza branch of the Palestinian music school, the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, was \u201ca catastrophe\u201d. \u201cMore than half of the Conservatory was burned. All the instruments were broken, thrown outside. You start seeing cases of instruments as soon as you get close to the Conservatory on the streets. Violins, we had more than 50, completely smashed. Cellos, more than 40, completely smashed.\u201d\n\nGuitar teacher Khamis Abu Shaban was delighted to find the piano intact\n\nAltogether, the Gaza branch of the Conservatory used to have more than 400 instruments - both Western classical ones and traditional Arabic instruments such as the oud, qanun and nay, a type of flute. Khamis says he felt \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d. But then he saw something which lifted his spirits. \u201cThe only\u2026 instrument that I saw standing was the grand piano. Honestly, I smiled when I saw it. I smiled and I laughed.\u201d\n\nTim Whewell examines the piano in 2015 after it survived a previous bombing and was restored by French music technician Claire Bertrand (also pictured)\n\nThe Yamaha concert grand also withstood bombing in a previous war between Israel and Gaza\u2019s rulers - Hamas - in 2014, and was carefully restored the following year by a French music technician. It became a symbol for many of aspirations that the territory could develop a flourishing musical culture. \u201cI started talking to the piano,\u201d says Khamis. \u201cI asked: \u2018Are you the only survivor of all the instruments? You don't want to die?\u2019 I really laughed.\u201d\n\nTim Whewell reported from Gaza in 2015 on the rescue of the territory\u2019s only concert grand piano after a previous war. Now, he finds out how musicians he met then are living and working through this war. He learns about a boy who started playing the violin after he lost his hand in an airstrike. And he finds out about the second near-miraculous survival of the grand piano.\n\nIt is too dangerous for the teachers and students to resume lessons at the music school, because of Israeli military operations in the area around it in north-west Gaza. Instead, they have started giving music lessons to tens of thousands of displaced children living in the makeshift camps where many Gazans now reside. They teach outdoors, under canvas awnings, or in schools and shelters run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees.\n\nMany of the music sessions are now held outdoors in camps for those displaced by the war\n\n\u201cLife goes on, and even with all this death around us, people need anything that can make them\u2026 not happy - no-one will be happy in this period - but something that can make them smile, be able to continue with life,\u201d Khamis says. The teachers - who are using whatever borrowed instruments they can find - include former students of the Conservatory, such as 16-year-old violinist Sama Nijim. One of her students is Mohammed Abu Eideh, a boy who lost his right hand in an airstrike. He used to play the oud - his favourite instrument - but this requires two hands. So Sama devised a way for him to learn violin instead - by tying a violin bow to his arm with a scarf, so that he could bow without the use of a hand.\n\nMohammed (L) who lost his hand in an airstrike is now learning the violin, by tying the bow to his affected arm\n\nSuch versatility on the part of the staff can also be seen in teacher Osama Jahjouh\u2019s fashioning of a nay - or traditional flute - out of a plastic pipe, because the Conservatory nays have been lost. Fuad Khader, who created a children\u2019s choir in Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of Gaza, says that at first it was difficult to persuade parents to let their children take part in the activities. \u201cThey asked: \u2018People are dying, and you want to teach kids to sing?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I just told them: \u2018Everyone has to do something. I\u2019m a musician. And this is my job.\u2019\u201d Another teacher, Ahmed Abu Amsha, says the music lessons had a transformative effect on the children. \u201cAfter a week, the families came to me and told me: \u2018You have changed our kids. They are getting better. They are singing, they are laughing.\u2019\u201d\n\nParents report their children being much happier as a result of the music lessons\n\nBut he adds: \u201cSometimes we are singing a song - and suddenly there's a big explosion, that makes us go silent and look at each other. And I say: \u2018Don't worry, let's continue.\u2019 I have to be strong in front of the children. And in some moments, they forget they are in a war. \u201cBut when they go, I'm not strong,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m sucking the bad energy from the kids. And when I try to go to sleep, it\u2019s a horrible feeling\u2026 [I will be] thinking of a kid - how he's seen dead bodies in the street, and his father is dead, and his sister and his uncle\u2026 Each child has a story to tell, and I try to heal them.\u201d As for the grand piano, Khamis Abu Shaban hopes students will one day be able to play it again.\n\nThe children learn various instruments in the camps - here they are playing the nay, a traditional flute\n\nHe says that when he last saw it, several months into the war, he lifted the lid and found that some of the strings had been cut and some of the hammers broken. \u201cI'm familiar with how an instrument can be damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cA hammer cannot be broken just by shock waves, for example. Someone has opened it and started sabotaging the inside.\u201d But Khamis' delight at having seen the piano is undiminished. \u201cNow, I see it still standing in front of me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s telling me: \u2018I'm not one to die. I'm still here for you. And I will stay.\u2019\u201d",

    "Michelle Yeoh 'felt a failure' for not having children\n\nMichelle Yeoh is one of the stars of the new Wicked film\n\nActress Michelle Yeoh has said she felt \"like such a failure\" for not having a baby. The Oscar winner said she always wanted to have a family, and her first marriage - to businessman Sir Dickson Poon - was partly \"about having children, a next generation and all that\". She had fertility treatment but that was unsuccessful, she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. \"And I think the worst moment to go through is every month you feel like such a failure,\" she said.\n\n\"And then you go, why? And I think at some point you stop blaming yourself. I go, there are certain things in your body that doesn't function in a certain way. That's how it is. \"You just have to let go and move on. And I think you come to a point where you have to stop blaming you.\" Yeoh, 62, won an Oscar last year for Everything Everywhere All at Once, and is also known for films like Tomorrow Never Dies, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians. She is about to be seen as Madame Morrible in the new film version of Wicked. Yeoh and Poon were married from 1988 to 1992. She said not having children was \"honestly not for the lack of trying because I have always and still do love babies\".\n\nYeoh won an Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once last year\n\nAsked by Woman\u2019s Hour presenter Nuala McGovern how long it took her to reconcile with the fact she would not be able to do so, she replied: \"Sometimes, honestly, I still think about it. \"I'm 62. Of course, I'm not going to have a baby right now, but the thing is we just had a grandchild. \"Then you feel you're still very, very blessed because you do have a baby in your life.\" She remarried last year, and her stepson and his wife had a baby in January.\n\nYeoh added that she felt blessed to also have a number of godchildren, nieces and nephews. However, it \"took a long time\" to come to terms with not having children of her own \"because that also maybe would be the main factor that broke up my first marriage\", Yeoh said. \"But you also have to understand, these are conversations that you really have to have with yourself and be able to look ahead and think, yes, we love each other very much now, but in 10 years or 20 years, I still can't give him the family that he craves for. And you have to be fair. \"That's why this dialogue between a couple is so important. Like, if one wants [a baby] and the other doesn't, this is something you have to face right at the beginning, because along the way, there will be a lot of hurt and difficult times. \"And so I think it was very brave on our path to admit, to say, 'OK, let's not drag this out, because that's what we are doing. Because, we tried.'\" Yeoh got engaged to French motor racing executive Jean Todt in 2004, and they got married in 2023.",
    "Republican Mike Johnson will likely remain Speaker of the House\n\nThe Republican Party have reached the 218-seat threshold to win control of the US House of Representatives. The win creates a Republican trifecta that will make it easier for President-elect Donald Trump to enact his agenda. The Senate, or upper chamber, and the White House had already flipped to Republicans - meaning the new president-elect will now have significant power after he is sworn in on 20 January 2025. The exact margin - likely to be slim - of a Republican lead in the House remains up in the air as several races have yet to be called.\n\nRepublicans will now have full control of Washington even if it is by narrow margins. This will give the party the ability to initiate spending legislation and launch impeachment proceedings against officials. Under Trump, a unified Republican Party could more easily push through tax cuts and introduce border control measures. The win for Republicans comes one week after Election Day after Republican Juan Ciscomani defeated his Democratic challenger in Arizona's 6th district. Republicans defended several seats in states like California and Arizona while also defeating Democratic incumbents in battleground districts. The party gained control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections and this win came despite a year of political party in-fighting capped off by chaotic speakership elections. But for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who won the party nomination on Wednesday to keep his job - though he still faces a House vote in January to retain the gavel - there's a possibility Republican numbers in the lower chamber may shrink. Trump has tapped several Republican House members in the last week to nominate to his cabinet, posing a potential threat to the party's lead.\n\nTrump's nominations - if confirmed through the Senate - will lead to several special elections and appointments by governors to fill the vacant seats. For Senate seats, governors appoint replacements who serve until the next election. The incoming vice-president, JD Vance, and Trump's pick for Secretary of State, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, will have seats filled by their respective state's governors. In the House, vacancies are exclusively filled by special elections - a process that often takes months to complete. Trump's pick for United Nations ambassador, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, will prompt a special election in New York's 21st congressional district. Congressman Michael Waltz, who Trump appointed to serve as his National Security adviser, will also see his seat in Florida's 6th district filled by a special election. Both seats are solidly red and will likely remain Republican. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz resigned from his seat on Wednesday after Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general, creating another House vacancy that will need to be filled.\n\nMargins could still fluctuate as outstanding House races are called. Here are several that we're still watching:\n\u2022 None Alaska at-large: Republican Nick Begich currently leads incumbent Democrat Mary Peltola, but the race has yet to be called.\n\u2022 None California's 9th: Republican Kevin Lincoln is challenging Democratic incumbent Josh Harder, who has a slight lead.\n\u2022 None California's 13th: Incumbent Republican Congressman John Duarte is running against Democrat Adam Gray. Duarte has been leading.\n\u2022 None California's 45th: Republican Congresswoman Michelle Steel, the incumbent, has been leading against Democrat Derek Tran.\n\u2022 None Maine's 2nd: Incumbent Democratic Congressman Jared Golden is fighting to keep his seat against Republican challenger Austin Theriault.

    "Will UK follow the US and allow the use of long-range missiles?\n\nNow that the US has given Ukraine the green light to use American-supplied long range missiles in Russia, what will the UK decide? Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pushing for permission from Washington to use the powerful US-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, to hit targets inside Russia. UK defence officials for their part have been seeking US approval for Kyiv to use Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain to hit military targets inside Russia. But London has not been willing to go it alone and had been waiting for the White House to change its mind, which it did on Sunday. The change of US policy paves the way for Ukraine to use Storm Shadow with fewer restrictions - something Ukraine has been requesting for months.\n\nStorm Shadow missiles, and their French equivalent called SCALP, have been sent in limited quantities - low hundreds not thousands - to Ukraine and so far have only been used against targets inside its borders. Ukraine has already used them against Russian-occupied Crimea - for example hitting Russia\u2019s Black Sea naval headquarters at Sevastopol. These missiles, which are launched from an aircraft, fly close to the speed of sound and carry highly explosive warheads making them an ideal weapon for penetrating Russian bunkers and ammunition stores. Protracted discussions about firing Storm Shadow missiles deep into Russia were raised during July's Nato summit in Washington. Starmer insisted the missiles were to be used for defensive purposes but said \"it's up to Ukraine to decide how to deploy it\". In a message on X at the time Zelensky wrote he had \"learned about the permission to use Storm Shadow missiles against military targets in Russian territory\", adding that he and Starmer had the \"opportunity to discuss the practical implementation of this decision\". But nothing actually happened after the summit. Zelensky made it clear the use of long-range missiles are a key part of his \u201cVictory Plan\u201d. He raised the issue again when he went to Downing Street to brief Starmer last month, in a meeting attended by the new Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. There was no change in policy, but Rutte said there was no legal reason to prevent Ukraine from striking Russia if the countries who supplied the missiles consented. UK Defence Secretary John Healey has worked hard to avoid to show any public disagreement with Washington. When recently asked about the matter in a joint press conference with US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, Healey said such discussions in public would only help Russia. And he is keeping tight-lipped about the UK's position now. On Monday he said he \u201cwon\u2019t be drawn on details about long-range missiles\u201d when asked about the use of UK weapons inside Russia. Responding to a question from the DUP MP Sammy Wilson in the House of Commons, Healey said \"it risks operational security and the only person that benefits from public debate is President Putin.\" He added he spoke to the US defence secretary on Sunday about Russian escalation over the weekend, and would be speaking to the Ukrainian defence minister later on Monday. \"I want this House to be in no doubt - the prime minister has been clear that we must double down and give Ukraine the support that it needs for as long as it needs. And we will continue to work in close co-ordination with the US in our support for Ukraine.\" The fear is that although Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s threats have turned out to be largely bluffs, allowing Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles could provoke a major escalation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned Putin had expressed such a move would put Nato \"at war\" with Russia - as such strikes would ultimately be carried out not by Ukraine but by the countries that give permission for such use of missiles. Professor Justin Bronk from defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute told BBC News it is \"very likely\" that US President Joe Biden's belated decision to allow long-range strikes with ATACMS ballistic missiles will also enable Storm Shadow to be used in at least the same way. \"US objections will presumably have been dropped for them,\" he said. \"Russian threats are unlikely to be considered a significant deterrent at this stage, since Russia has threatened dire consequences - including allusions to nuclear attacks - repeatedly throughout the war at each stage when Western equipment has been supplied.\" But he said there is little reason to think that expanding the usable area for UK Storm Shadow \"will make any difference\" to Ukraine's ability to hit back at Russia. He added \"most of the more critical targets such as fighter bombers on Russian air bases are likely beyond the range of these missiles in practical terms - and there will be a limited number of the missiles available after lengthy combat use of the system in the war to date.\"\n\u2022 None Biden allows Ukraine to strike Russia with American long-range missiles",

This was Catherine's first official public engagement since she finished her chemotherapy treatment. Royal sources say she decided to join Prince William to show her \"support, empathy and compassion to the local community\". The couple spoke to emergency responders who helped at the scene of the devastating knife attack in the north-west seaside town.\n\nCatherine gave a hug to some of the emergency workers, with fire chief Phil Garrigan saying \"she could see the emotion in them\". The royal visit to Southport had been planned as a low key event, to allow time to be spent in private with families of the three children who died and with the yoga teacher who was present during the attack. But Catherine was a surprise addition as she made one of only a handful of public appearances this year, since revealing her cancer diagnosis. Wearing a long brown, autumnal-looking coat, she arrived with her husband to meet the bereaved families and emergency workers described by Prince William as \"heroes\". With her chemotherapy having ended, Catherine has begun a gradual return to work, including meetings about her early years campaign last month. However, this is the biggest moment so far in returning to royal duties. Catherine has spoken of having \"good days and bad days\" and Kensington Palace has cautioned that her appearances might have to be flexible and be subject to last minute changes.\n\nCatherine speaking to an air ambulance paramedic on her Southport visit\n\nThe prince and princess heard there were still raw emotions about the attack\n\nThe visit to Southport was intended by Prince William and Catherine to show the community that it had \"not been forgotten\". The prince and princess heard about efforts to bring the community together after the knife attack - and the wave of riots that followed. Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, were killed on 29 July, 2024, in the attack on a children's dance group. The royal couple spent 90 minutes talking to the families of the three children - and later passed on the families' thanks to emergency responders, in a meeting in Southport Community Centre. Catherine told the emergency workers they had supported families through their \"darkest times\" - and she said: \"On behalf of them, thank you.\" Ten other people \u2013 eight of whom were children \u2013 were injured in the stabbings. Axel Rudakubana, 17, was arrested at the scene and has been charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.\n\nThe royal couple told emergency workers from police and the health services about the importance of protecting their own well-being and mental health. \"The first thing we thought about was actually how on earth you guys are going to handle having seen what you've seen. So please take your time, don't rush back to work, do whatever you need to,\" said Prince William, who with Catherine has campaigned for people to be more open about mental health concerns. The couple had made a donation to a fundraiser to provide physical and psychological help for police and ambulance staff who were caught up in the attack and the riots that followed. In a message on social media, Prince William and Catherine said their Southport visit had been a \"powerful reminder of the importance of supporting one another in the wake of unimaginable tragedy\". Former chief constable Andy Rhodes described the visit as a \"massive boost\" for emergency workers. \"It was quite emotional. It is still raw for people,\" he said.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "Woman, 31, made will fearing husband would kill her\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Ceri Owen talks about the escalation of abuse by her ex-husband\n\nWarning: This article contains details of abuse some may find distressing\n\nMaking a will and taking out life insurance at 31 seemed like necessary steps for a woman who thought she would die at the hands of her abusive husband. Describing how he would pull out her hair, stamp on her head, stop her sleeping and washing, Ceri Owen said she was reduced to \"a shell of a person\". She went from an outgoing, confident person during their five year relationship to one who felt worthless, and urged women in similar situations to seek help. The UK government has pledged to clamp down hard on perpetrators of domestic violence, with the minister for victims likening them to \"terrorists\".\n\n\"It became a lot of more aggressive and frequent,\" Ceri, now 33, told the BBC Wales Live programme. \"Pinning me down, punching me, pushing me over and digging his nails into me.\" Over the five years, things had changed slowly, from name calling, to controlling her behaviour. Her partner would try and control when she was allowed to sleep or bathe. Trying to rationalise it now, Ceri, from north Wales, said: \"I found it became my normal, I'd think I was crazy and that it was all my fault. \"I'd gone from a confident outgoing person, to a point where I was silenced and wouldn't argue back.\n\nCeri feared she would die - either at the hands of her partner, or through not being able to cope. A \"lightbulb moment\" came when her boss noticed a change in her behaviour, as she added: \"I think someone else recognising it outside of friends and family, made it seem more real for me. \"He was helpful and supportive.\" Ceri knew she had to leave as she wanted to end her own life, saying: \"I could not survive being there any longer.\" Despite ending the relationship, her ordeal was not over.\n\nDespite thinking she had no future while with her ex-partner, Ceri is enjoying life again now and happy\n\nIn May 2022, her ex-husband broke into her house at night and attacked her, along with new partner. It followed an escalation in his behaviour in the days leading up to this, as she added: \"I think I'd had about 500 calls in the three days before. \"He came to the house quite a few times but I had managed to get him to go away.\" North Wales Police investigated, and Ceri's ex-husband was charged with assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and stalking involving serious alarm. He admitted the offences and was jailed for three years and two months in February 2023, as well as being banned from contacting Ceri or her new partner for a decade. Ceri decided to speak out to raise awareness of dangerous signs in a relationship. \"No form of abuse is acceptable, no-one does anything to deserve being abused and there are people and services that can help you,\" she said.\n\nCeri would regularly be left with cuts and bruises on her body\n\nCeri was described as \"courageous\" by North Wales Police Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman. She is the Wales lead for violence against women and girls, and added: \"I would hope that Ceri\u2019s story would help give people confidence that if they ring us, we will listen and we will look at action.\" In July, the National Police Chiefs' Council, external declared violence against women and girls a \"national emergency\", external. This was after it was revealed that more than one million related crimes, external were recorded in Wales and England in 2022-23, making up 20% of all crimes documented by the police.\n\nCeri has been able to put the ordeal behind her and found love again with new partner Ben\n\nMinister for victims, Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, said the issue is as serious as terrorism. She added: \"It is, and it has been for a very long time. \"If this was terrorism, it would be front page news, every single day.\" She believes Ceri would have helped countless women by speaking out, but said: \"Sadly her story is not unique.\" The UK government has pledged to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. Plans including domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms in Wales and England have already been announced. \"On average, three women a week are killed at the hands of men because of domestic abuse and violence in this country,\" Ms Davies-Jones added. \"That is totally unacceptable and it has to change.\" She said the scale of the issue is \"horrific\" and reported statistics are the \"tip of the iceberg\".",
    "The week that pushed the Middle East closer to all-out war\n\nPeople evacuate a wounded man after an Israeli strike in Beirut on 4 October\n\nThere have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. This is the worst. In the past seven days, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. Western and regional powers - led by the US - have pushed for de-escalation. The UN Security Council called for an \"immediate end\" to hostilities and the G7, which includes the US, UK and Germany, has called for \u201crestraint\u201d. But so far those efforts have failed - and the Middle East stands closer than ever to all-out war. Here\u2019s how the last week played out.\n\nAs the sun set over Beirut on 27 September, the south of the city was hit by a series of huge explosions. Several apartment buildings had been struck, leaving a huge crater in the ground. Plumes of dust and debris filled the skyline, visible from across the Lebanese capital. The strike, aimed at an underground bunker, killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Seen as a prize-target, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for years for fear of being assassinated by Israel. His death capped a week of ramped-up Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah that had left more than 500 people dead. The week before that, a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions targeting the group left at least 32 dead and over 3000 injured. Nasrallah\u2019s death wiped all hopes of a de-escalation, which just hours earlier had seemed possible. A US proposal for a 21-day ceasefire had been discussed on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York. Israel\u2019s UN ambassador Danny Danon had even said his side was \u201copen to ideas\u201d. But hours after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on an early flight home from the UN - and any lingering hopes of diplomacy prevailing faded away.\n\nThree days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon, marking the start of a ground invasion. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its operations would be \u201climited and targeted\u201d. Fighting so far has driven nearly 1.2 million people from their homes, according to Lebanon\u2019s crisis unit. At least 8 Israeli soldiers have been killed. Israel says the operation is aimed at stopping Hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and drones over the border \u2013 something it has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the current Gaza war. Now Israeli troops are fighting a ground war on two fronts simultaneously: Gaza and Lebanon. That hasn\u2019t happened in decades. The last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, ended inconclusively with UN Resolution 1701, which stipulated Hezbollah withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon. That never happened, and with Iranian support, Hezbollah grew in strength. Israel has not said that it wants to remove Hezbollah entirely from Lebanon\u2019s political landscape (as it has with Hamas in Gaza), but for all its talk of this being a \u201climited and targeted\u201d operation, it\u2019s clear that Israel is ruthlessly determined to cut Hezbollah down in size. Spurred by an astonishing two and a half weeks, Israel is in an ambitious frame of mind.\n\nThe next day, at around 19:30 local time, 10 million Israelis were sent running for bomb shelters across the country after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The nation's air defence system sprang into action - and allies including the US and UK were involved in repelling the attack - another sign of the broadening scope of the conflict. The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern Israel. The only person reported to have been killed was a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank. With its biggest proxy group in disarray, Tehran calculated that to restore some semblance of deterrence it needed to do something more dramatic than its last well-telegraphed missile and drone attack on Israel in April. Hence the larger number of ballistic missiles and the lack of advance notice. But while the attack was more than purely demonstrative, it did not appear to signal Iran\u2019s desire for an all-out fight. That\u2019s hardly surprising. If it came to a full-on war, Iran knows that it would lose, and badly. It could even herald the end of the Islamic Republic. Israel, with powerful western allies - and a smattering of Middle Eastern neighbours willing to help shoot down Iranian missiles - is a regional superpower. Iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match. Nor does it have the sort of allies that would be willing to spring to its defence in the event of a confrontation. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, made suitably defiant noises at Friday prayers in Tehran, but Iran knows it cannot afford to escalate much further.\n\nDespite Hezbollah\u2019s devastating losses, it has vowed to fight on in Lebanon. And history shows us it is easy for Israel to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. As for Israel\u2019s response to Iran, the region - and the world - has been on tenterhooks since Tuesday. US president Joe Biden said he has discouraged Israel from striking Iranian nuclear or oil facilities as part of its retaliation. A severe reaction seems inevitable, though, and some of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s recent rhetoric suggests that he might be thinking, ultimately, of regime change in Iran. But Israel\u2019s immediate objectives are closer to home. \u201cTotal victory\u201d in Gaza and removing the threat posed by Hezbollah along the northern border. Israeli leaders point out that they at war on many fronts. Benjamin Netanyahu says there are seven: Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Yemen, Iran, Iraq and Syria. It\u2019s true that over the past year, attacks have come from all these directions, even though pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria have so far posed little real threat. We\u2019re not seeing an all-out regional war just yet, but with so many players feeling they have a stake in it, the war in Gaza has metastasised in a dramatic fashion.",
    "'I was worried about bleeding on McGregor's expensive shirt'\n\nHannah Rankin (left) beat Deborah Melhorn by split decision on her Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship debut\n\nScotland's former light-middleweight boxing world champion Hannah Rankin made her Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) debut on 12 October. In her BBC Sport column, Rankin, 34, discusses her win over Deborah Melhorn and her reasons for taking up the sport.\n\nI have fought 21 times as a professional boxer. I am a former world champion who has faced Claressa Shields and Savannah Marshall and been on some massive stages. Yet there was a strong feeling of the unknown when I made the ring walk for my bare knuckle debut in a bullfighting arena in Marbella which looked like a mini colosseum. I felt electric, like a gladiator. This was a completely different sport to boxing. You cannot spar without gloves when training for bare knuckle, so I had no real idea how it would actually feel to punch \u2013 and be punched \u2013 without protection on your fist. Immediately before the start, the referee told us to \"tow the line\" \u2013 which is different from boxing as there are no opposite corners in the circular BKFC ring. You are told to \"knuckle up\" as you stand beside your opponent. There is no feeling out process before meeting in the centre of the ring. During the first two rounds I was learning on the job, but halfway through the third I found my range and flow. I put my combinations together and I then understood what this sport was all about. After my win, loads of boxers - including Sandy Ryan and Chantelle Cameron - messaged to congratulate me. My good friend Shields sent a voice note saying: \"Bestie, you're officially the crazier one out of the two of us.\"\n\nI needed a new challenge and bare knuckle fighting has always fascinated me. Yes, you are throwing punches, but your opponent will come at you a lot faster than boxing. The stance is different and you can even hold and hit, so I had to get used to the grappling part. When you throw a punch, you have to make sure you are making a tight fist so as not to hurt your hand when you land. Accuracy is so important too. You do not want to land knuckle on elbow - bone on bone - although inevitably that is what happens. Financially, it is much better for me than boxing. Just like the UFC, there are opportunities to increase your purse with fight-of-the-night and knockout bonuses. A lot of it is down to former UFC champion Conor McGregor, who is a part owner of BKFC. His involvement has really blown the sport up. People judge him on being loud, lairy and full on but McGregor is so obsessed about all combat sports and his energy is infectious. It is not just for the cameras. He is working non-stop, 24/7, promoting BKFC. He was messaging me throughout my camp to see how my training was going, and he gave me a big hug after the fight, telling me I was a warrior. I was worried my cut was going to bleed on his very expensive shirt.\n\nRankin won 13 pro boxing bouts with 8 defeats after turning pro in 2017\n\nMy dad has attended all my boxing matches apart from two during the pandemic. I will always be my daddy's little girl. But I said this time he had no obligation to be there. \"Yeah, I think I might give this one a miss, Hannah,\" he told me. As soon as I finished the fight, my head coach phoned my sisters and dad to let them know everything was fine. Everyone says bare knuckle must be very dangerous and there is no protection, but I can honestly say that the pre-fight and after-fight medical care for my fight on Saturday was better than any boxing situation I have been in. What people sometimes don't realise - and some of my family didn't - is that it is only five two-minute rounds. I'm not in there for a 10-round war like I would for a world title boxing fight. A lot of the injuries are superficial \u2013 they are cuts and not the same as taking repeated blows to the head with gloves which could end up in something serious. I plan to be back out again in the US in the new year. I would never rule out a return to boxing, buy my goal now is to win a bare knuckle world title and become a two-sport world champion.\n\u2022 None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

June Spencer recounts her lifetime on The Archers\n\nJune Spencer, who played matriarch Peggy Woolley in BBC Radio 4's long-running drama The Archers from 1951 until her retirement in 2022, has died at the age of 105. Spencer was one of the programme's original cast members, and the show's current editor Jeremy Howe said working with her \"was like working with a legend\". He added: \"June\u2019s Peggy Woolley was and always will be the Queen of Ambridge, and with her death The Archers has lost its link with the birth of the show over 70 years ago. It is a humbling moment for us all.\" A family statement said she died peacefully in her sleep in the early hours of Friday.\n\nJune Spencer, pictured in 2003, made her final appearance on The Archers in 2022\n\nPeggy Woolley, formerly Archer, was often viewed as a traditionalist, conservative character in the soap opera charting the ups and downs of life in fictional village of Ambridge. Paying tribute, Radio 4 controller Mohit Bakaya said: \"June Spencer has been a longstanding presence and companion for Radio 4 listeners during her exceptional run on The Archers. \"Many have grown up with June as Peggy and listened as she journeyed through life\u2019s many chapters, with all of its ups and downs. In her later years, her portrayal of a devoted wife caring for a husband with dementia, including their very moving final goodbye, was deeply poignant and powerful radio. \"We send all our love and condolences to June\u2019s family and the many people whose lives she touched.\"\n\nIn 2019 June Spencer celebrated her 100th birthday with cast members from The Archers in the recording studio\n\nHowe said working with the actress had been \"one of the great privileges of my time at the BBC\". \"June Spencer wasn\u2019t just a brilliant Peggy Woolley, the ultimate matriarch of Ambridge, but a brilliant actress,\" he said. \"I only ever worked with her in radio, but her technique, her precision, her delivery were flawless. \"One of the cast once remarked that in all her time in the show he had only ever heard her fluff her lines the once. \"She was an actress who revelled in her craft, someone who could score a bullseye with a gently insulting cough as if it were a bon mot from Oscar Wilde. \"She was also a great company member - funny, sharp, warm, never gossipy, but with wonderful stories of the early days of radio drama, self deprecating and a great companion.\" Spencer's family said they wanted to \"pay particular tribute and thanks to the staff team at Liberham Lodge, who so lovingly cared for her in the last two years\".\n\nThe Queen celebrated The Archers' 70th anniversary with Spencer and a tractor cake\n\nSpeaking in 2019 as the show's only original cast member, Spencer said: \"I had no idea I'd be ever be 100 for a start, let alone still working! \"It's been marvellous, I hope I can keep on doing it for a bit, and perhaps set an example to older people who have just given up,\" she said. Three years later, when she did decide it was time to leave the show, she said: \"In 1950 I helped to plant an acorn. It took root and in January 1951 it was planted out and called The Archers.\" She added that \"over the years it has thrived and become a splendid great tree with many branches. But now this old branch, known as Peggy, has become weak and unsafe so I decided it was high time she 'boughed' out, so I have duly lopped her\".\n\nThe present Queen was among Spencer's many fans, and as Duchess of Cornwall she invited the actress and her co-stars to Clarence House for a reception in 2021, marking the show's 70th anniversary. Last year the Queen celebrated the 20,000th episode of the show by raising a glass to the \"joy, tears and laughter\" it gives. The Queen paid tribute to Spencer in a post on social media, calling her \"a much-loved part of so many people\u2019s lives, brilliantly combining in Peggy Woolley the roles of reassuring matriarch and 'gangsta granny'.\" She said: \"She will be greatly missed and I send my heartfelt condolences to her family.\" In the mid-1950s, Spencer took a break from playing Peggy and the role was taken over by Thelma Rogers. Spencer returned to the role in the early 1960s, when Rogers departed. Spencer was made both an OBE and CBE and in June 2010 she received the Freedom of the City of London.\n\nSpencer, who celebrated her 105th birthday in June, had been living at Liberham Lodge care home in Surrey",
    "'I married the train driver who saved my life'\n\nCharlotte and Dave married in 2022, three years after their first encounter\n\nWarning: This article contains references to suicide and mental health issues.\n\nOn a summer afternoon in 2019, nurse Charlotte Lay got ready for her night shift as normal but \"wasn't feeling quite right\". Within a short space of time she had decided to end her own life close to a West Yorkshire railway station. But thanks to the kindness of the train driver who found her in crisis, she did not go through with it. Three years later they married each other and went on to have children.\n\n\"I'd struggled with my mental health since my teens and I'd been in and out of the system since,\" Charlotte, now 33, says. Her memories of that day five years ago are \"quite blurry\" but she says she remembers seeing a train pulling up on the tracks where she was, close to Crossflatts Station, near Bradford. \"I remember seeing a man getting off the train and starting to panic and thinking he was going to tell me off,\" she recalls. \"He approached me and said 'hi, my name is Dave, are you having a bad day?' \"I said \u2018yeah, just a bit\u2019. He went \u2018OK\u2019, we can sit and talk until it feels better.\"\n\nCharlotte says she and Dave wanted to share their story to show people who are struggling that \"life gets better\"\n\nDave, who works for train operator Northern, remembers getting out of his cab, \"kneeling down\" in front of Charlotte and introducing himself. He told her they would talk things through \"until you feel comfortable enough\" to get onto the train, where she could be taken to safety. The pair talked for half an hour, by which time Charlotte, though still distressed, agreed to get into the cab. She was taken to Skipton Station and left in the care of the police. The following day, Charlotte was desperate to find the man who had been so kind to her and issued an appeal on a local Facebook group for anyone who worked for Northern who might be able to put her in touch. \"I\u2019d have understood if he didn\u2019t want to hear from me, but I just wanted to say \u2018thank you\u2019 for giving me the time and for treating me like I was human being,\" she says. Her plea was successful and after Charlotte was given Dave's number by one of his colleagues who had seen the appeal, she sent him a text. Dave, who is now 47, was equally relieved to hear from her. He says he had \"never had the opportunity\" to get off the train and talk to someone in crisis before. \"I needed to know she was all right,\" he explains. \"I\u2019d contacted police to try to find out what happened to her and just wanted to make sure she was safe. \"I felt like I\u2019d had a duty to make sure she was all right. We\u2019d had that rapport built by the side of the track. It was just nice to be able to make that difference to somebody.\"\n\nThe couple credit each other with saving their lives\n\nAfter Dave returned Charlotte's text telling her he was available whenever she needed to speak to someone, they began exchanging messages on a daily basis. They then met for a coffee two months later and the rest was history. In 2022, the couple, who live in nearby Wilsden, got married, with Charlotte 22 weeks pregnant. But before then, there was one more twist to their story. In July 2020, Dave was diagnosed with testicular cancer, after he went to his GP with a bad back. He is adamant that he would never have gone to the doctors were it not for Charlotte's insistence. \"It's because I'm a bloke,\" he says. \"I'd done 12 or 13 years in the motor trade working on cold floors and out in the elements, lifting and carrying silly things. I just put it down to a bad back. \"Charlotte kept saying 'go to the doctors'. I said it was just me getting old.\"\n\u2022 None The mates who have met for a pint every Thursday for 56 years\n\u2022 None 'This town is where goths feel safe and accepted'\n\u2022 None The family shop saying goodbye after 64 years Weeks after his diagnosis, Dave was given the all clear. A consultant at St James' Hospital in Leeds last year told him he would no longer have been alive had he not had been diagnosed when he was. \"Charlotte may say I saved her life, which I don\u2019t know about really, but she saved my life as well,\" Dave says.\n\nThe couple say they wanted to share their story in the hope that anyone who is struggling can know better times are around the corner. \"Life does get better,\" Charlotte, who is now a mum of three, says. \"You just have to be here to see it.\" Charlotte says that it is often too difficult for people who are struggling to \"reach out\" and ask for help, so suggests people around them \"reach in\" instead. She continues to receive ongoing support for her mental health. She believes asking someone if they are OK more than once can help them open up. \"We owe it to each other to be checking in with people around us,\" she says. \"You don't have to offer life-changing advice or say anything profound. Just sitting down with a cuppa can make all the difference. \"Because of what I\u2019ve been through, I had a duty to talk about it and I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to be a conversation starter.\"\n\u2022 None If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here, external.",
    "Family want to buy farm to dig for body\n\nMuriel McKay's body has not been found ever since her disappearance and murder on 29 December 1969\n\nThe family of a woman who was kidnapped and murdered at a farm want to purchase the property and dig for her body. Muriel McKay was never found after being killed at Stocking Farm, near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, in 1969. The Metropolitan Police spent \u00a3160,000 conducting an eight-day search at the site in July but it ultimately proved unsuccessful. Mrs McKay's grandson, Mark Dyer, said he was willing to pay more than \u00a31m to purchase what he branded \"the most evil place on earth\".\n\nHe admitted it would be a \"difficult thing to do\" emotionally but said it could be necessary for closure. The digs in July took place after the last surviving murderer, now living in Trinidad, gave information about where Mrs McKay was allegedly buried. Nizamodeen Hosein was not permitted to return to the UK to assist in the search, which the McKay family felt hampered the effort.\n\nThree separate digs have taken place at Stocking Farm since the murder, but none have proved successful\n\nIan McKay, Mrs McKay's son, told the BBC: \"All this depends on the property owner wanting to sell. \"Purchasing Rook\u2019s Farm would be an emotional response to allow the family to properly search and hopefully seek closure.\" The owners of the farm have been contacted for comment.\n\nNizamodeen Hosein, who murdered Mrs McKay, has stated he would come to England to assist with any searches\n\nMr Dyer said if his family did buy the property in the future, ownership would only be \"transitional\". They would purchase it, hire specialists to conduct a private search for Mrs McKay and then sell it on, he explained. In October 1970, Nizamodeen and brother Arthur Hosein were given life sentences for kidnapping and holding Mrs McKay, 55, for a \u00a31m ransom, before murdering her. She had been snatched in a case of mistaken identity on 29 December 1969, with the siblings believing she was the then-wife of newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Earlier this year, Mr Dyer flew out to Trinidad with Mrs McKay's daughter, Dianne, and Nizamodeen showed them on a map where he believed the body was buried. The murderer's lawyer, Matthew Gayle, told the BBC Nizamodeen remained willing to come to England to assist with a dig.\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Beds, Herts & Bucks?",
    "Campaigners said the equivalent of 17 tankers of waste a day was dumped into a Pembrokeshire river (file photo)\n\nTens of thousands of cubic metres of untreated waste water, including sewage, was dumped in a river in 2023, campaigners have said. The Cleddau Project said Welsh Water data showed pumps at Picton in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, were running at 80% capacity from July 2022 to February 2024. That meant 56,000 cubic metres - the equivalent of 17 tankers a day - which should have been going to a sewage treatment plant, was instead going into special conservation area the Western Cleddau. Welsh Water apologised and said its Picton pumping station had been upgraded and spills cut.\n\nRic Cooper said a pipe was \"spilling what looked like raw sewage more often than we'd ever seen in the past\"\n\nBut it admitted there could be problems at other sites across Wales. The Cleddau Project's Ric Cooper said campaigners investigated because an overflow pipe at Picton playing fields appeared to be spilling more raw sewage than usual.\n\nThe group asked Welsh Water for pump performance data from the nearby pumping station. They are, according to Mr Cooper, supposed to pump at 120 litres a second but had only been operating at \"95 or 96\". \"That means 20% of what should have gone for treatment was going straight into the river,\" he said. \"We calculated over 12 months, and it averages out as 17 tankers a day emptying into this river. \"You can imagine the outcry if on 17 occasions, a tanker pulled up and let it all go.\" Welsh Water data showed the overflow pipe at Picton in 2023 discharged 133 times for almost 647 hours. The Cleddau Project said it found high levels of ammonia in the water and that tests showed sewage was being discharged at levels toxic to fish. The group said it was reported to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) several times, which investigated in June 2023, almost a year later.\n\nThe Cleddau Project said pumps at Picton pumping station, in Haverfordwest, were operating at just 80% capacity for 18 months\n\nThe Cleddau Project said it took another nine months before the pumps were up to speed. Another campaigner, Simon Walters, said the spills would affect sewin and salmon movements. He added that E. coli levels were \"way\" above that permitted for safe bathing. He said: \"We used to swim in here as kids. I wouldn't let my dog swim in here now.\" NRW and Welsh Water bosses, he believed, needed to resolve the matter. Mid and South Pembrokeshire MP Henry Tufnell, who met the Cleddau Project members, Welsh Water and NRW last week, called the pollution \"not acceptable\".\n\nSimon Walters said the area was a special area of conservation and should be protected\n\nNRW needed more resources, he believed, as it was investigating only 20% of alleged breaches reported. He said the UK government was taking \"definitive action\" on tackling pollution with a bill which would give increased powers to regulators to tackle polluting companies. In July, Ofwat confirmed it had served formal notices and opened an enforcement case against Welsh Water and three other companies into how they managed waste water treatment works and networks. Welsh Water \"apologised\" for any damage to the Western Cleddau. Waste water chief Steve Wilson said the equipment monitor flow on the Picton overflow pipe had been fitted before the deadline of regulator NRW. \"To upgrade that pumping station, we had to install new pumps and a new panel, which actually took 26 weeks to be built,\" he added.\n\nThe Cleddau Project said data showed a storm overflow pipe at Picton playing fields discharged 133 times in 2023\n\nIt was now operating correctly, he said. Mr Wilson said the company was upgrading sites in Wales as fast as possible to improve water quality. The company, he said, planned to spend \u00a34bn between 2025 and 2030, with \u00a3100m on improvement and maintenance in Pembrokeshire, subject to Ofwat approval. NRW confirmed it was made aware of a problem in June 2023, and was told by Welsh Water new pumps would be installed by 31 October 2023. It said the deadline was missed and Welsh Water were given a formal warning. The work to repair the pumps was completed in February 2024, it said. NRW said the pumping station was \"subject to a formal legal investigation for another matter\".",
    "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot arrives at the Avignon courthouse on Monday\n\nFrench prosecutors have demanded a 20-year jail sentence for Dominique Pelicot, who is accused of drugging his former wife Gis\u00e8le for a decade and inviting 50 men recruited online to rape her. Mr Pelicot, who has admitted to the charges, should also undergo medical treatment for 10 years, prosecutors said. Twenty years - the maximum sentence for rape under French law - \"is both a lot... and too little given the gravity of the acts that were committed and repeated,\" said prosecutor Laure Chabaud. Referring to an assessment of Mr Pelicot made by a psychiatrist earlier in the trial, Ms Chabaud said that the defendant presented \"multiple sexual deviances\". Verdicts and sentences are expected next month.\n\n\"He sought pleasure through a desire to submit, humiliate and debase his wife - the person he claimed to cherish the most in the world,\" Ms Chabaud told the court, saying that Mr Pelicot, 72, should be re-examined at the end of his sentence before being released. Another prosecutor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayet, said the trial had shaken up society and that what is at stake \"was not a conviction or an acquittal\" but \"to fundamentally change the relations between men and women\". Mr Mayet paid tribute to the \"courage and dignity\" of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who was in court as she has been most days since the trial began in September. Her decision to waive anonymity and have an open trial has led to a huge amount of interest in the case, which has in turn sparked a nationwide conversation on rape culture, consent and chemical submission - drugging someone for the purposes of coercion or assault. On Monday morning posters reading \"20 years for everyone\" had appeared on the walls around the Avignon courthouse where the trial is taking place. However, it is unlikely the 50 defendants in this extraordinary case will be handed sentences this long. The longest jail term requested by prosecutors today - excluding the 20-year demand made for Mr Pelicot - was for Jean-Pierre Marechal, a co-defendant who is not accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, but who has admitted to drugging and raping his own ex-wife on Mr Pelicot's advice and instruction. He is facing 17 years in prison.\n\nPosters have appeared on the streets of Avignon, spelling out \"Rape is rape - 20 years for each\"\n\nProsecutors also demanded 10 years for most of the other 19 defendants whose cases were examined today. The majority of the 50 accused deny the charges of rape, arguing that they cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious when they were invited to the family\u2019s home by her husband, and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her. But prosecutor Ms Chabaud said that \"in 2024 we can no longer maintain that because she didn't say anything, she consented.\" She added that neither the circumstances nor the behaviour of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \"could have led these men to believe that she agreed to be subjected to these sexual acts in her lethargic state.\"\n\nIn an address to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Prime Minister Michel Barnier said this trial was a watershed moment for the country's efforts to combat violence against women. \"I'm convinced that the Mazan trial will mark a before and after,\" he said. Mazan is the name of the village where the Pelicots lived and where Dominque Pelicot filmed the local men he had contacted online. The prime minister also announced a series of government measures to combat violence against women, including funding for pharmacies to dispense home drug test kits under a pilot scheme to fight chemical submission. Earlier on Monday, Equality Minister Salima Saa said the government was \u201cfully mobilised\u201d and announced the expansion of a system which allows victims of sexual violence to file complaints in hospitals and not just police stations. The system is currently used in 236 hospitals and will be extended to 377 by the end of next year. A new awareness campaign was also announced. The trial, which opened in early September, is now in its final stretch. Lawyers for the 50 defendants will make their closing arguments over the next three weeks, and a verdict is expected by 20 December.",

    "Ms Hand accused the MMA fighter of rape after a night out in 2018\n\nIreland's justice minister has commended a Dublin woman for her \"bravery and determination\" after winning a civil case against Irish mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Conor McGregor. Nikita Hand, who accused the sportsman of raping her in a Dublin hotel in December 2018, won her claim against him for damages in a civil case at the High Court in the Irish capital on Friday. The total amount of damages awarded to Ms Hand by the jury was \u20ac248,603.60 (\u00a3206,714.31). McGregor has indicated on social media that he intends to appeal the decision.\n\nJustice Minister Helen McEntee said Nikita Hand had shown \"there is light at the end of the tunnel\"\n\nJustice Minister Helen McEntee praised Ms Hand's bravery and said she had shown \"there is light at the end of the tunnel\". \"I just want to commend Nikita for her bravery, for her determination and the leadership that she has shown in what has been - I've no doubt - a very, very difficult time for her and indeed, for her family,\" McEntee said. She added: \"Because of wonderful people like Nikita, I hope that it shows that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that there are supports available to people, and that there is justice at the end of the day.\"\n\nMs Hand had also taken a case against another man, James Lawrence, 35, of Rafter's Road, Drimnagh in Dublin. She alleged that he assaulted her by having sex with her without her consent in the Beacon Hotel. The jury found that he did not assault her.\n\nMs Hand said in a statement outside court on Friday that she hoped her case would remind victims of assault to keep \"pushing forward for justice\". Describing the past six years as \"a nightmare\", she said: \"I want to show [my daughter] Freya and every other girl and boy that you can stand up for yourself if something happens to you, no matter who the person is, and justice will be served.\" During the case, Ms Hand said she was \"disappointed and upset\" that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided not to prosecute after she made a complaint to the Irish police. In a letter to her in August 2020, the DPP said there was \"insufficient evidence\" and there was not a reasonable prospect of conviction. Ms Hand asked the DPP to review the decision, saying she felt she was being treated differently because one of the suspects was famous.\n\nConor McGregor has been ordered ordered to pay Nikita Hand almost \u20ac250,000 in damages\n\nAsked about the DPP's decision not to prosecute, Ms McEntee said: \"We have a very independent system in this country, and I think that's right. \"Our DPP, she's independent in the decisions that are taken, and for good reasons that there should never be any political interference in that process. \"There is always an option for an individual to ask for reasons to be outlined as to why the DPP made a particular decision, and that is open to any individual or any case, but I have, since becoming minister, given priority to and enabled a new office within the DPP to open specifically focused on sexual offences, so that this issue can be given the focus and the priority that it needs.\"\n\nFine Gael leader and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris has spoken by phone to Ms Hand to express solidarity with her.",
    "Captain Sir Tom Moore said at the time that writing his memoir was an opportunity to raise more money for charity in his name\n\nThe family of renowned pandemic fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore damaged public trust in charities by refusing to donate any of the \u00a31.4m received from his book deal, a long-awaited report has found. The Charity Commission said his daughter and son-in-law displayed a \"pattern of behaviour\" in which they benefited personally from the Captain Tom Foundation and people \"would understandably feel misled\". The World War Two veteran became a household name during the first Covid-19 lockdown, by walking up and down his driveway in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire. The \u00a338.9m raised by Capt Sir Tom for NHS Charities Together, as a result of his efforts, did not form part of the commission's inquiry, and all of that sum went to NHS charities. Capt Sir Tom's family said they had been treated \"unfairly and unjustly\".\n\n\"The charity set up in his name has not lived up to that legacy of others before self,\" said Charity Commission chief executive David Holdsworth. \"The public \u2013 and the law \u2013 rightly expect those involved in charities to make an unambiguous distinction between their personal interests, and those of the charity and the beneficiaries they are there to serve.\" Mr Holdsworth said there were repeated instances of a \"blurring of boundaries between private and charitable interests\" and that Hannah and Colin Ingram-Moore benefited significantly. \"Together the failings amount to misconduct and/or mismanagement,\" he said. He added its report had found \"repeated failures of governance and integrity\", and that its inquiry had been fair, balanced and independent. The commission concluded, however, that the actions of the family did not represent criminal behaviour and it had not passed its findings to police. Paul Latham, the director of communications at the Charity Commission, told the BBC: \"We haven't seen evidence of a crime. If we do, we have very close relations with the police and of course, would do so. \"There is a high bar for criminal offences and we have not identified that.\" In July 2023, the Captain Tom Foundation announced it was not actively seeking donations or making payments, but the foundation has not been closed down.\n\nHannah and Colin Ingram-Moore laid a wreath earlier this month at the Burma Star Memorial in Staffordshire\n\nThe Captain Tom Foundation was registered as a grant-making charity two months after the veteran's walk began, and celebrities including David Beckham and Dame Judi Dench later helped to promote its various fundraisers. The father-of-two died aged 100 in February 2021, with coronavirus. His son-in-law Mr Ingram-Moore became a trustee of the foundation that same month, and Capt Sir Tom's daughter - Mrs Ingram-Moore - became interim chief executive later that year. The couple\u2019s roles came into question in June 2022, when the commission launched a statutory inquiry to determine if they had benefited privately at the charity\u2019s expense.\n\nThe family's private company was paid an advance of \u00a31.47m for Capt Sir Tom\u2019s three books\n\nThe regulator\u2019s findings showed that Club Nook, a private firm set up by the Ingram-Moores in April 2020, was paid an advance of \u00a31.47m for Capt Sir Tom\u2019s three books, including his best-selling autobiography, Tomorrow Will be a Good Day. The publisher Penguin, and promoter Carver PR, said the family gave repeated assurances that part of the advance would be used to set up and fund the foundation.\n\nIn addition, a press release, various marketing materials and the prologue of Capt Sir Tom\u2019s memoir, all stated that the books would be used to support or raise money for the foundation. However, to date the charity has not received any money from the publishing agreement. In 2022, the commission said the inquiry twice asked Mr and Mrs Ingram-Moore to \"rectify matters by making a donation to charity\" but \"on both occasions they declined\". The publications were \"a purely commercial endeavour\" and \"had damaged public trust\" in charities, the report concluded.\n\nMrs Ingram-Moore was on a salary of \u00a385,000 as interim chief executive when she acted as a judge at an awards ceremony bearing the charity's branding\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, Capt Sir Tom acted as a judge for the Virgin Media Local Legends Awards and was personally paid \u00a310,000. The following year, his daughter was approached to be a judge and signed an ambassador agreement with Virgin Media O2 while chief executive of the Captain Tom Foundation, for which she was paid \u00a318,000. The subsequent Virgin Media O2 Captain Tom Foundation Connector Awards included the charity's logo on its awards plaque. She had already been made interim chief executive at the charity, on an annual salary of \u00a385,000.\n\u2022 None What has happened to Captain Tom's legacy?\n\nHowever, the report said there was no record that she informed the charity trustees when she entered into the financial arrangement with Virgin Media. The commission said it did not agree with Mrs Ingram-Moore\u2019s assertion the work was undertaken in a personal capacity. It found this created a conflict of interest, and her failure to avoid or manage this situation \"amounted to misconduct and-or mismanagement\", adding this also meant the payment she received was an \"unauthorised benefit\" to her husband, who was a trustee at the time.\n\nCentral Bedfordshire Council forced the Ingram-Moores to tear the spa building down in February\n\nIn 2021, the Ingram-Moores received approval from the council to build a Captain Tom Foundation building beside their home, after referencing the charity\u2019s name and number \"numerous times\" in the planning application. However, the resulting building, which contained a spa pool and home cinema, was described by council enforcement officer Richard Proctor as \"wholly unauthorised\" and the family was forced to demolish it in February. The Charity Commission found the couple failed to consult the trustees about the spa complex, which suggested \"they were using the charity and its name inappropriately for their private benefit\". The Ingram-Moores told the inquiry the inclusion of the charity\u2019s name in the initial planning application was an error, claiming they were busy with \"global media work\" at the time, but they did intend to use the building for charitable purposes.\n\nOther findings contained in the report showed:\n\u2022 None Mrs Ingram-Moore was \"very much involved in discussions around setting her salary\" and said to trustee Stephen Jones that \"her expectations were in the region of \u00a3150,000 per annum\". Her claim that she was not offered a six-figure salary was described as \"disingenuous\" by the inquiry\n\u2022 None She \"purposely\" removed the conflicts of interest clause from her employment contract with the charity, telling Mr Jones: \"This is not a legal requirement... I will not be doing anything to conflict with all my roles but I cannot be in a position to request authority at every turn, my life would grind to a halt.\"\n\u2022 None Since the Ingram-Moores' company, Club Nook, owned the Capt Sir Tom trademarks, trustees had to consult with them when it wanted to use his name for charity purposes, including by asking for permission to sell printed mugs In July, Mr and Mrs Ingram-Moore were disqualified from being a trustee or holding a senior management position in charities for a period of eight and 10 years respectively. Mr Holdsworth urged the Ingram-Moores to \"follow through on the commitment that was made and donate a substantial amount to the charity\". He said it was up to the remaining trustee whether to take legal action and the Commission \"stood ready to provide advice as they considered that\". In a statement, a spokesperson for the Captain Tom Foundation said it was \"pleased with the Charity Commission\u2019s unequivocal findings regarding the Ingram-Moores\u2019 misconduct\". \"We join The Charity Commission in imploring the Ingram-Moores to rectify matters by returning the funds due to the Foundation, so that they can be donated to well-deserving charities as intended by the late Captain Sir Tom Moore. \"We hope they do so immediately and without the need for further action\", the spokesperson added. Responding to the Commission's report, the Ingram-Moores said they had been treated \"unfairly and unjustly\". They said the two-year inquiry had taken a \"serious toll\" on the family's health and described the process as \"excessive\", adding that the charities watchdog had a \"predetermined agenda\". \"True accountability demands transparency, not selective storytelling,\" the statement said, adding that they \"never took a penny\" from public donations.\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Beds, Herts & Bucks?",
    "Why there is silence on Ten Hag's Man Utd future\n\nErik ten Hag has been Manchester United manager since 2022\n\nManchester United held a monthly board meeting in central London on Tuesday which the BBC reported as being significant in determining the immediate future of United manager Erik ten Hag. The meeting lasted around six hours, with footage of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe arriving and leaving published by some media. After the big build-up, silence. We don't know the outcome because no-one is saying. Last summer, United took just over two weeks from their FA Cup final win over Manchester City to confirm Ten Hag would continue in his job, after days of speculation before and after the game that the Dutchman would be sacked. The BBC reported that United were considering other managers as part of that review. When Ineos decided to stick with Ten Hag, they triggered the option for an additional year on his contract, which now runs to 2026.\n\nIn addition, significant elements of Ten Hag's backroom team were changed, including the exits of assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag and coach Steve McClaren. To add to the sense of change, in July Dan Ashworth and Omar Berrada finally came off respective periods of gardening leave to take up the sporting director and chief executive roles. This created the structures which Ineos felt United had lacked prior to Ratcliffe's part purchase of the club, which had been announced on 24 December the previous year. After an eighth-place finish, the club's worst of the Premier League era, optimism was high around Old Trafford about a significant improvement. On 29 September, United were hammered 3-0 at home by Tottenham. Questions began to be posed again about Ten Hag's tenure. On 30 September, officials at United let it be known that Ten Hag would stay in his job for the forthcoming games against Porto and Aston Villa. It was not stated the situation would be reassessed after those games, but that was an interpretation some made externally.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Friday, when asked directly in an on-camera interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan whether he \"had faith\" in Ten Hag, Ratcliffe replied: \"I don't want to answer that question. I like Erik. I think he's a very good coach but at the end of the day, it's not my call, it's the management team that's running Manchester United that have to decide how best we run the team in many different respects. \"They've not been there a long time, so they need to take stock and make some sensible decisions. \"Our objective is very clear \u2013 we want to take Manchester United back to where it should be, and it's not there yet, obviously \u2013 that's very clear.\" Ratcliffe's words made headlines - but were also interpreted by some as an indication some kind of decision would be reached after the Villa game. Ratcliffe, Berrada and Ashworth were part of the United delegation at Villa Park, who were all pictured sat together - alongside former manager Sir Alex Ferguson - at the top of the main stand for the 0-0 draw, which dropped United to 14th in the Premier League. Eight points from their opening seven games is United's worst return since the 1989-90 campaign.\n\nSo, after a week featuring two draws in very different styles - a chaotic 3-3 in Porto and a dour 0-0 at Villa - I asked Ten Hag two questions in his post-match news conference, firstly about the external noise and secondly if he felt the owners were still behind him. \"Simon, you said it very good, external noise,\" he replied. \"Internally we are disappointed and we know we have to do better.\u201d And on support from the ownership: \"I don't have any idea it is different because they should have told me. We communicate very open and very transparent.\" By Monday, some sort of clarification was expected from the club, which didn't come. Ratcliffe and co-chairman Joel Glazer were pictured going into Old Trafford. Glazer, it transpired, was attending a meeting of the club's Fan's Advisory Board. Club officials did communicate it was likely the performance of the team would be discussed at the board meeting in London the following day. Attendees were captured arriving and leaving but since then, nothing. Those at United whose responsibility it is to communicate messaging have questioned why they should offer guidance around this board meeting when they never do at any other point. As far as official statements go, there has been nothing. I approached United board member and Ineos Sport chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc for a comment at the European Clubs' Association meeting in Athens he is attending on his club's behalf. He politely declined. For now, Ten Hag remains in his job and he is having a few days away from the club as is customary during an international break. So unless the situation changes, he will return to begin preparations for the Premier League game with Brentford at Old Trafford on 19 October.",

    "Seven killed in Israel in deadliest Hezbollah rocket strikes in months\n\nSmoke was seen rising from the Israeli town of Metula following a Hezbollah rocket attack on Thursday\n\nTwo separate Hezbollah rocket attacks have killed seven people in northern Israel, authorities say, in the deadliest day of such strikes in months. An Israeli farmer and four Thai agricultural workers were killed when rockets landed near Metula, a town on the border with Lebanon, Israeli and Thai officials said. Later, an Israeli woman and her adult son were killed in an olive grove near Kibbutz Afek, on the outskirts of the coastal city of Haifa. Hezbollah said it had fired barrages of rockets towards the Krayot area north of Haifa and at Israeli forces south of the Lebanese town of Khiam, which is across the border from Metula.\n\nThe Israeli military identified two projectiles crossing from Lebanon and falling in an open area near Metula on Thursday morning. The Israeli farmer who was killed was named by local media as Omer Weinstein, a 46-year-old father-of-four from nearby Kibbutz Dafna. Thailand's Foreign Minister, Maris Sangiampongsa, said on Friday that four Thai nationals were killed by rocket fire. A fifth Thai worker was injured, he added. Videos posted online showed them being transferred by helicopter to the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said Mr Weinstein and the foreign workers were in an agricultural field near the border fence at the time of the attack. It cited a member of the local emergency response team as saying the Israeli military had permitted them to enter the area despite Metula being inside a closed military zone. The military established the zone at the end of September, just before it launched a ground invasion of Lebanon with the aim of destroying Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure.\n\nA 60-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son were killed while picking olives near Kibbutz Afek\n\nThursday\u2019s second rocket attack reportedly hit an agricultural area near Kibbutz Afek, which is about 65km (40 miles) south-west of Metula and 28km from the Lebanese border. The military said a total of 55 projectiles were fired towards the Western Galilee region, where the kibbutz is located, as well as the Central Galilee and Upper Galilee in the early afternoon. Some of the projectiles were intercepted and others fell in open areas, it added. According to Haaretz, 60-year-old Mina Hasson and her 30-year-old son, Karmi, were killed by a rocket that hit an olive grove where they were picking olives. A 70-year-old man was also lightly injured by shrapnel and taken to Rambam hospital, according to the Magen David Adom ambulance service. \"We were called to the olive grove and saw a man in his 30s lying on the ground, unconscious,\u201d MDA paramedics Mazor and Yishai Levy told the Jerusalem Post, external. \u201cWe began resuscitation efforts while conducting further searches, during which we located another casualty, also in critical condition with multi-system injuries. We provided her with medical treatment and performed resuscitation, but unfortunately, we had to pronounce both of them dead,\" they said. Meanwhile, the head of the Irish military said a UN peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon that houses Irish troops was hit by a rocket fired towards Israel on Wednesday night. The rocket landed inside an unoccupied area of Camp Shamrock, which is 7km (4 miles) from the Israeli border, causing minimal damage on the ground and no casualties, Lt Gen Sean Clancy said. Irish premier Simon Harris said: \"Thankfully everyone is safe but it is completely unacceptable that this happened. Peacekeepers are protected under international law and the onus is on all sides to ensure that protection.\u201d\n\u2022 None US envoys in push for Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire The deadly rocket attacks in northern Israel came as two US special envoys met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss a possible ceasefire deal to end the war with Hezbollah. Netanyahu told Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk that the main issue was what he called Israel's ability to \u201cthwart any threat to its security from Lebanon in a way that will return our residents safely to their homes\u201d, his office said in a statement. Israel went on the offensive against Hezbollah - which it proscribes as a terrorist organisation - after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. It said it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of northern Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks, which Hezbollah launched in support of Palestinians the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 2,200 in the past five weeks, and 1.2 million others displaced, according to Lebanese authorities. Israeli authorities say more than 60 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket, drone, and missile attacks in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nA woman was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in the Kayyal area of Baalbek\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said troops were continuing operations inside southern Lebanon and that aircraft had struck dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout the country. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry meanwhile said Israeli strikes had killed six paramedics in three southern towns. Four from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Society\u2019s Civil Defence branch, which provides emergency services, were killed when Israeli forces targeted a gathering point at Derdghaya junction, it said. A fifth IHS paramedic was killed in an air strike on a vehicle in Deir al-Zahrani, while a strike in Zefta killed a paramedic from the Islamic Risala Scout Association, which is affiliated to the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement, according to the ministry. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. But dozens of paramedics and other emergency workers have been killed and injured since it intensified its air campaign against Hezbollah five weeks ago. The military has previously accused Hezbollah of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters. The IHS has denied having ties to military operations. There were also fresh Israeli strikes near Baalbek, in the eastern Bekaa Valley, a day after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of the entire city and two neighbouring towns. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported that a woman was killed in a strike in the Kayyal area, external. Another six people were killed when a house was bombed in Maqna, which is 5km north-east of Baalbek but was not included in the evacuation zone, it said.",

I pay taxes, and I work.\" \"In any case, I'm undocumented,\" she added. \"[So] how would they even know about me?\" In an election campaign where immigration loomed large as a major concern of US voters, Trump frequently pledged to deport migrants en masse from US soil from his first day in office if he were to return to the presidency. But nearly two weeks after his sweeping election win, it remains unclear what exactly these immigration enforcement operations will look like. The president-elect has insisted cost won't be an issue, and has confirmed he plans to declare a national emergency to secure the necessary resources. But experts have cautioned that his promises may run into enormous financial and logistics challenges. His newly appointed \"border tsar\", Tom Homan, has said that undocumented migrants deemed to be national security or public safety threats will be a priority. And he has suggested workplace raids - a practice ended by the Biden administration - could return. Speaking to Fox News on Saturday, the former acting director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first term challenged the notion that \"those who enforce the law are the bad guys and those who break the law are the victims\". \"What member of Congress, what governor or what mayor is against taking public safety threats out of their community?\" he asked, adding that the new administration would \"follow through on the mandate that American people gave President Trump\".\n\nUS authorities deporting migrants is nothing new. More than 1.5 million people have been expelled under President Joe Biden, in addition to millions swiftly turned away from the border during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the eight-year administration of Barack Obama - whom some dubbed the \"deporter-in-chief\" - about three million people were deported, with a focus on single men from Mexico that could easily be deported from border regions. Trump's promised plans, however, are more wide-ranging and aggressive, including enforcement operations in the US far from the border. Officials are reportedly also mulling using the National Guard and military aircraft to detain and ultimately deport people. JD Vance, Trump's running mate and incoming vice-president, has said that the deportations could \"start\" with one million people. Still, some undocumented migrants believe that they will benefit from a Trump presidency instead of being kicked out. \"A lot of Latinos, those who can vote, did so because they think he [Trump] can improve the economy. That would be very good for us too,\" said Carlos, an undocumented Mexican who lives in New York City. His son is a US citizen. According to the American Immigration Council - a non-partisan organisation that conducts research and advocates for an overhaul of the US immigration system - there are more than five million Americans who were born to undocumented parents and have the security of US citizenship. Carlos says he is \"a little\" worried about getting swept up in immigration raids. But that fear is tempered by the possibility of an improved economy under Trump and more work. \"Things may be a bit tense right in our communities right now, but being worried isn't a solution,\" he said. \"The best thing to do is avoid problems and not commit any crimes.\"\n\nPromises of mass deportations formed a key part of Donald Trump's 2024 electoral campaign - and featured heaving at the Republican National Convention in July\n\nThere are many others who don't share in this optimism, and are living in fear. Among them is California resident Eric Bautista, a so-called \"Dreamer\", who benefits from a longstanding programme that protects from deportation those who were brought illegally into the US as children. At 29, Mr Bautista has only fleeting memories of life in Mexico, the country in which he was born and left at the age of seven. For the last four years, he has taught US history to high schoolers - including details of how waves of immigrants from Italy, Ireland, China, Japan and Mexico settled in the country, and often faced xenophobia. \"I don't think I've ever felt this way, even after more than 20 years here,\" Mr Bautista told the BBC. \"It feels like we're at a turning point, a new wave of nativism like those I teach about. \"It's just a future of fear and uncertainty for us.\" Advocates and legal experts said there was no guarantee that undocumented migrants without criminal convictions would not be ensnared in ramped-up deportation efforts. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, said that he foresaw an uptick in \"collateral arrests\" - a term used in the first Trump administration to describe immigrants swept up during enforcement actions even though they may not have been the original targets. \"Let's say they go after somebody with a criminal record, and that person lives in a house with four other [undocumented] people,\" he said. \"We saw with the first Trump administration, they'll arrest those people as well.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS, the BBC's US partner, Homan was asked about a hypothetical situation in which a grandmother was caught up in a \"targeted\" enforcement operation going after criminals. When asked if she would be deported, Homan responded \"it depends\". \"Let the judge decide,\" he said. \"We're gonna remove people that a judge has ordered deported.\" The arrest and potential removal of such collateral arrests would mark a drastic departure from the Biden administration, which has focused on public safety threats and deporting people soon after their apprehension at the border. While Homan recently dismissed suggestions that there could be \"a mass sweep of neighbourhoods\" or large detention camps set up, the stock prices of companies that could be involved in building detention facilities have jumped by as much as 90% since the election. They include publicly traded prison firms GEO Group and CoreCivic. Undocumented migrants are employed throughout the US economy - from agricultural fields to warehouses and construction sites. Mr Reichlin-Melnick said operations targeting such workplaces could lead to \"indiscriminate\" detentions. \"I don't think that being a person with no criminal record [who] pays taxes protects anybody,\" he said. \"One of the first things that Trump will do is get rid of the Biden administration's enforcement priorities. And we've seen that when there are no priorities, they will go after whoever are the easiest targets.\" The possibility of becoming \"an easy target\" has worried many migrants - particularly those from families with mixed legal statuses. Their biggest fear is finding themselves separated. Brenda, a 37-year-old Mexico-born \"Dreamer\" in Texas, is currently protected from deportation but her husband and her mother are not. Her two children were born in the US and are American citizens. While Brenda told the BBC she does not believe that \"good people\" would be the first targets for deportation, she can't escape the thought that her husband could be sent back to Mexico. \"It's important for us that we see our sons grow up,\" she said. \"Of course, the thought of being separated leaves one frightened.\"",
    "WHO approves first mpox test for quick diagnosis\n\nMore than 30,000 suspected mpox cases have been reported across Africa this year - but less than half have been confirmed through a test\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has approved the first diagnostic test for mpox where the results can be immediately known, saying it could prove pivotal in helping to stop the rising global cases of the deadly virus. The new PCR test enables the detection of the mpox DNA taken from skin lesion swabs. Currently, samples have to be sent to a laboratory for testing and the patient and medics have to wait days for the result. Limited testing capacity and delays in confirming cases continue to be a challenge in Africa - worsening the spread of mpox that was previously known as monkeypox.\n\nOf the more than 30,000 suspected cases reported in Africa this year, barely 40% had been confirmed through a test, the WHO said. Yukiko Nakatani, the WHO's assistant director-general, described the new diagnostic test as \"a significant milestone\". \u201cIncreasing access to quality-assured medical products is central to our efforts in assisting countries to contain the spread of the virus and protect their people, especially in underserved regions,\" she added. The breakthrough comes as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the highest number of cases has been reported, prepares to begin an mpox vaccination programme on Saturday. Mpox, which is a highly contagious disease, has killed at least 635 people in that country this year.\n\u2022 None What is mpox and how is it spread? In August, the outbreak of the virus was declared a global public health emergency by the WHO for the second time in two years, following rising cases in DR Congo and its spread to neighbouring Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda. Some Western countries have donated doses of mpox vaccines to combat the outbreak of the disease in Africa but reports say more are urgently needed. Rwanda, which was the first to administer mpox vaccines in Africa last month, is set to receive 5,000 more doses on Friday, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). In Nigeria, a vaccination drive against the virus is set to be rolled out next Tuesday, the Africa CDC said. Frontline healthcare workers and close contacts of infected patients are set to be given priority in DR Congo, which has 200,000 vaccines donated by the European Commission, it said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

    "Sara Sharif's body was found in August last year\n\nSara Sharif\u2019s teacher twice saw her at school with bruises on her face five months before she was found dead, a jury has heard. Helen Simmons told the Old Bailey that Sara said she \u201chad fallen over on some roller-skates\" after she saw her injuries in March 2023. Sara's body was found with dozens of injuries at her family home in Woking in August last year. Her father Urfan Sharif, 42, stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and uncle Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murder. The trial continues.\n\nJurors previously heard Sara had been hooded, burned, bitten and beaten during more than two years of abuse. Ms Simmons, who was Sara\u2019s teacher in Year 4 and Year 5, said she saw \u201ca bruise on the underside of her chin and one on her cheek\". She said that after Sara did not give a consistent account of her injuries, her school, St Mary\u2019s primary in West Byfleet, made a referral to Social Services. More than two weeks later, Ms Batool \u201cmarched towards\u201d her and said Sara had a bruise on her face, the court heard. \u201cShe told me it was made by a pen,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said before I jumped to conclusions again, it was just a pen\u201d \u201cIt was strange. It felt very defensive,\u201d Ms Simmons said.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nMs Simmons also said Sara had twice been taken out of school for home-schooling, once in June 2022, and again after April 2023. She said on the first occasion the school wanted to understand why and her father and stepmother said \u201cthey were worried about her progress at school and her friendships\". Ms Simmons described Sara as \u201cessentially a happy child\u201d, \u201coften bubbly\u201d and said that \u201cat times she could be sassy\". \u201cShe could be very spirited and quite bold and fierce in what she wanted to say.\u201d \u201cShe loved to be on the stage and singing and performing. That was her happy space.\"\n\nEarlier the jury heard from Usman Choudhry and his sister Fatima Choudhry who was a class assistant at Sara\u2019s school. They both said they had heard Ms Batool swearing at Sara's siblings in Punjabi. Mr Choudhry said he had also seen Ms Batool dragging the children. The court previously heard Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik were arrested in the UK after they had travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, on 9 August 2023, the day before Sara's body was found. The three defendants are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they deny.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, and on X, external.

    "King Charles III and Queen Camilla are due to arrive in Australia on Friday on a historic royal tour. Eight months ago, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be writing those words. In February, Buckingham Palace announced the King had cancer and all his \u201cpublic-facing duties\u201d stopped - on doctors\u2019 orders. Back then, a trip to Australia seemed unthinkable. A flight of around 24 hours, a punishing time difference, and days of royal engagements would surely be too much for a 75-year-old dealing with a cancer diagnosis and embarking on treatment. But palace aides never took this trip completely off the table - whenever it came up, their language was careful. \u201cIt\u2019s not been ruled out\u201d, they\u2019d say, or \u201cdecisions will be made on the advice of doctors\u201d, and \u201cthe King needs to focus on treatment for cancer first\u201d. And by late Spring, there were signs the visit might still go ahead. Some of the King\u2019s team travelled to Australia and Samoa to assess what was possible and finalise arrangements, liaising with the Foreign Office and both the Australian and New Zealand governments. Would the King be well enough to cope with the rigours of the tour? The answer was yes - with some important changes.\n\u2022 None King and Queen land in Sydney on tour of Australia\n\nOn medical advice, New Zealand was removed from the schedule. Buckingham Palace said it was a choice made \u201cin collaboration\u201d with the Australian and New Zealand governments, and acknowledged it was a \u201ctough decision\u201d. Royal aides have been open about the King\u2019s diagnosis and treatment but they have never revealed the type of cancer the King has nor offered details of the kind of treatment he\u2019s receiving. \u201cHis health is on a positive trajectory,\u201d they tell us. What is clear is the King\u2019s treatment is ongoing and his cancer requires regular medical management. But he is well enough for his doctors to sanction this trip, and while he is away his cancer treatment has been paused. Removing New Zealand and keeping this trip short means he can return to his regular routine of treatment as early as possible.\n\nEarlier this month, the King hosted a reception to celebrate the UK's Commonwealth diaspora at St James' Palace in London\n\nThe programme of events for the King and Queen also looks a bit different from regular royal tours. When they arrive they will have a day to recover before starting engagements. It\u2019s a long journey - they are both in their 70s and the day off is again a nod to the King\u2019s condition. The timetables in Australia and Samoa do not include evening engagements. There are no state dinners, and no trips out late in the day. But we will see more of the King over the next nine days than we have for most of this year. Buckingham Palace says a lot of thought has gone into \u201cbalancing the programme\u201d and it has been planned to \u201cpreserve the King\u2019s energies\u201d. This is Charles\u2019 first visit as King to one of the 14 realms where he remains Head of State. It will also be his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), where he is head of the association of 56 countries. The King\u2019s reign has been compromised by his cancer diagnosis, but this trip gives a real sense of him being back in business.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla will take time to acclimatise after arriving in Sydney\n\nAs well as doctors' orders, the King has also had to operate under the Queen\u2019s orders. His wife has found herself going solo more than she might have anticipated this year, continuing with several engagements she was due to carry out alongside her husband. Queen Camilla is an influential figure within the royal household and has referenced her husband\u2019s \u201cworkaholic\u201d mindset at several public engagements \u2013 even after his cancer diagnosis. She has been key to ensuring the King follows medical advice and takes time out to recover during his treatment. And she will be doing the same in Australia and Samoa over the course of this visit, as well as taking on some of her own engagements around issues including literacy and supporting victims of domestic violence.\n\nRoyal tours require precision planning. There is a choreography to them and a check list of moments to hit \u2013 parliaments, dignitaries, military, environment and culture. On paper, the Australia element of this trip is traditional and safe territory. But it is also significantly different from what has gone before. The King first visited Australia in 1966 as a 17-year-old starting two terms of teaching experience at a private school in Victoria. He returns as a 75-year-old monarch receiving treatment for cancer, towards the end of a year during which he has faced immense personal challenges. His public life has been restrained, restricted by illness. And although his schedule became busier as he progressed with his treatment, he then retreated to the solace of Balmoral for a summer break and to prepare for this trip. \u201cHow\u2019s the King doing?\u201d is a question I have been asked repeatedly this year - and it\u2019s been tricky to answer at times. The coming days will allow us to see the King at work day after day. Up close, a head of state, King of Australia. This tour is are big showcase for the monarchy, and monarchies need to be seen \u2013 even more so in a country where an Australian republic has been an active topic of political debate in recent times. The optics matter for Buckingham Palace. A King looking well, engaging with the public, managing a full timetable of events, doing some soft diplomacy and embracing what Australia and Samoa have to offer is the goal. Getting here hasn\u2019t been easy. But there is confidence from royal aides that this visit will give a strong sense of normal service resuming.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our free Royal Watch newsletter.

    "Former Strictly star Giovanni: I'm strict but not a bully\n\nGiovanni Pernice left Strictly after the allegations and is now part of the Italian version of the show\n\nFormer Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice has said he's a \"strict teacher\" but not a bully, after the end of a BBC investigation into allegations about his behaviour in rehearsals. Actress Amanda Abbington, his dance partner last year, has described his behaviour in the training room as \"inappropriate, it was mean, it was nasty, it was bullying\". After an internal investigation, the BBC apologised to Abbington earlier this month after upholding some of her complaints against him, but clearing him of the most serious allegations. \"Bully is a big word and there's a difference between being a bully and caring about what you do,\" he told ITV's Lorraine on Tuesday.\n\nWhen the BBC's report was published, BBC News was told the review looked into 17 complaints and six were upheld. A source said those upheld related to verbal bullying and harassment, but the most serious allegations of physical aggression were not upheld. The report and details of which complaints were upheld have not been published. Pernice said those that were upheld related to \"verbal bullying\", but during the interview he also claimed the investigation \"didn't find me a bully, which is exactly why I'm relieved now\". He told Lorraine's guest host Christine Lampard: \"I'm glad that the 11 allegations have been thrown out. \"At the beginning there were very serious allegations, for instance threatening her or abusing her, and all of this has been taken out.\" Discussing his training methods, he said: \"I'm a strict teacher. I said it myself. I care about my job. I'm very, very competitive. I've won the glitterball before. It doesn't mean that I have to win every time, but I will make sure that I will do everything to get the best out of you.\" Pernice won the show with Rose Ayling-Ellis in 2021, and came second three times in the other seven years before being partnered with Abbington. Dancing is \"a difficult discipline\", he said, but he insisted he wouldn't change his methods because \"teaching the way I teach is the successful way to approach this\".\n\nAbbington pulled out of the show after six weeks for \"medical reasons\"\n\u2022 None Strictly: The Story Behind the Headlines\n\nPernice admitted getting frustrated in rehearsals, but said that was common for anyone on the show. \"I get frustrated, the celebrity gets frustrated, and trust me when I say every single person on Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing With The Stars in the world would get frustrated because you feel the pressure. \"You feel the pressure that you want to perform perfectly on the Saturday night. \"So frustration, I think, is something that when you want to be good, it happens. And I do care about my job.\" He described Abbington as \"brilliant\" and \"unbelievable at dancing\", and said she didn't discuss her complaints with him at the time. \"All I had was, 'Giovanni you're an amazing teacher', 'Giovanni you're great'.\" He added: \"We never had an argument. We always had discussions about steps.\" Abbington's account of their time together differs significantly. Following the conclusion of the BBC's report, she told the BBC's Newsnight it had been \"an ongoing litany of being verbally abused\". \"There was a 35-minute rant at me with him throwing his hands up in the air and calling me names and telling me all sorts of things that I was and how he couldn't really cope with it any more,\" she said. \"And this went on for, you know, seven hours a day, for seven weeks.\" On Lorraine, Pernice responded that \"there is so much that is not true in these things\" and \"I never called her names in that room\". In a separate interview with the Daily Mail, Pernice admitted the pair shared \"very rude banter\" and that producers were concerned by some of the names they were calling each other. But he claimed she told them: \"It's absolutely fine, I started it.\" He said he had not spoken until now because the BBC had asked both sides not to until the investigation was over. He was angered, however, by an interview Abbington gave to Channel 4 News in July, he told the Mail. During that interview, host Krishnan Guru-Murthy - who also took part in last year's series - suggested she had been subjected to \"humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature\". She tearfully agreed that was the case, but said it was not sexual harassment, and that it was \"one of the many things\" that happened. In the Mail, Pernice said: \"My Sicilian blood would rise up and I'd think, this isn't the truth - but I had to remain silent. \"It was the first time there was talk of anything sexual. Of course, I was worried it could destroy my career - the people that come to my shows are kids and women. \"I was painted as a person I am not. It seemed like the only point was to destroy me.\"",
    "Netflix is starting to raise prices in some countries as growth spurred by its crackdown on password sharing starts to fade. The film and TV streaming giant said it had already lifted subscription fees in Japan and parts of Europe as well as the Middle East and Africa over the last month. Changes in Italy and Spain are now being rolled-out. In its latest results, Netflix announced that it had added 5.1 million subscribers between July and September - ahead of forecasts but the smallest gain in more than a year.\n\nThe company is under pressure to show investors what will power growth in the years ahead, as its already massive reach makes finding new subscribers more difficult. The last time Netflix saw signs of slowdown, in 2022, it launched measures to stop password sharing and said it would offer a new streaming option with advertisements. The crackdown unleashed a new wave of growth. The firm has added more than 45 million new members since last year and has 282 million subscribers globally. Analysts also expect advertisements to eventually become big business for Netflix. For now, however, Netflix has said it remains \"early days\" and warned it did not expect it to start driving growth until next year, despite many subscribers opting for the ad-supported plan. The plan, which is the company's least expensive option, accounted for 50% of new sign-ups in the places where it is offered in the most recent quarter, Netflix said.\n\nBaby Reindeer, created by and starring Richard Gadd, has been a big hit for Netflix\n\nEven without a boost from advertising, Netflix said revenue in the July-September period was up 15% compared with the same period last year, to more than $9.8bn (\u00a37.5bn). Profit also rose from $1.6bn in the same period last year to $2.3bn. Netflix last raised prices in the UK and US in 2023 but that only affected certain plans. It has left the price of its popular \"standard plan\" without adverts untouched since 2022. In the past, the company has sometimes experimented with pricing in smaller countries before making changes in major markets, such as the US and UK. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Netflix's strong financial position put the firm in a position to keep spending money to make new hits - the key if it hopes to raise prices without backlash. \"This is inherently a fickle market, with consumers happy to swap streamer if they don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting value,\" he said. \"The addition of fresh content is key to that, especially in areas like sporting events, and could give Netflix the edge it needs to push prices higher and keep customers coming back for more.\u201d One of Netflix's biggest successes has been Baby Reindeer, a drama created by and starring Scottish comedian Richard Gadd. The controversial series won four Emmy Awards last month.",
    "King accepts flowers for Queen who misses Royal Variety over illness\n\nKing Charles III has accepted flowers on behalf of the Queen as he arrived at the Royal Variety Performance alone on Friday. Earlier in the day, Buckingham Palace said Queen Camilla would not be attending the show following \"lingering post-viral\" symptoms from a recent chest infection. Doctors have advised the Queen - who is 77 - to prioritise rest as she continues to recover from her infection that resulted in her pulling out from many scheduled events including Remembrance Sunday. She returned to public duties last week, but is understood to still be under the weather after a busy week of engagements.\n\nOn Wednesday the Queen appeared at an event at the University of London, where she was presented with an honorary doctorate of literature by Princess Anne. A Palace source said the Queen is disappointed to be missing the annual event at the Royal Albert Hall in London, but that she \"is a great believer that 'the show must go on'\". \"She hopes to be back to full strength and regular public duties very soon,\" the source added. Upon arrival at the show, King Charles was given a posy meant for the Queen by an eight-year-old. The flowers had been picked from the gardens of Brinsworth House, the Royal Variety charity's nursing home. Friday's performance is being presented by Amanda Holden and Alan Carr, and will see Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish present a musical number from their new show The Devil Wears Prada.\n\nThe King waves as he arrives as the Royal Albert Hall in London\n\nThe Royal Variety Performance will air on ITV in December\n\nThe Queen's return to public duties had been adjusted to avoid any setback to her recovery. Other events she attended this past week include a reception she hosted at Clarence House for authors shortlisted for this year\u2019s Booker Prize, and a Buckingham Palace reception to celebrate the TV and film industry. Both engagements were shorter than originally planned. The Queen's chest infection came just under a week after returning from a trip to Australia and Samoa with the King. The trip included a stopover in India on the way back. Announcing the infection earlier this month, Buckingham Palace said: \"Her Majesty The Queen is currently unwell with a chest infection, for which her doctors have advised a short period of rest.\" It said she had cancelled her engagements \"with great regret\". The Queen previously missed a week of engagements with ill health in February 2023, when she tested positive for Covid. It was the second time she contracted the virus, having previously had it the year before.",
    "McMonagle was sentenced at Londonderry courthouse on Friday\n\nFormer Sinn F\u00e9in press officer Michael McMonagle has been jailed for child sex offences. He had already been placed on the sexual offenders' register after an earlier court appearance when he pleaded guilty to 14 charges. They relate to various dates between May 2020 and August 2021. On Friday at Londonderry Crown Court, McMonagle was sentenced to nine months in custody and a further nine months on licence.\n\nMcMonagle, 43, who has an address of Limewood Street in Londonderry, originally faced 15 charges, including attempting to incite two children to engage in sexual activity. He was also accused of 13 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child. At his first court appearance last year he was charged with three offences but 12 more were added later.\n\nOn Friday, the court in Derry heard how McMonagle had communicated with a number of online accounts which were run by police officers posing as children. The judge said that across all charges there had been \"in total six decoy/fictitious children ranging from 12 years to under 16 years\". According to the judge, McMonagle had said he was \"ashamed of his behaviour and deeply regretted the hurt and problems he had caused for other people\". Due to McMonagle's guilty plea, the judge said he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence. A defence barrister criticised the coverage of the case in the media and said there \"had been a near-total collapse of the truth\". He described the defendant as \"a victim of a media witch hunt\" and said the case had been \"politicised\".\n\nCh Supt Lindsay Fisher says McMonagle had \"combed the internet\"\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing on Friday, PSNI Ch Supt Lindsay Fisher described McMonagle as a \"predator who was combing the internet for underage victims\". Police said that, during an operation led by their child internet protection team, it was discovered that over the course of 15 months from May 2020, McMonagle interacted with a number of child profiles online with ages between 12 and 14. In August 2021, police said, he attempted to get what he believed to be multiple children aged 14 and under to perform sexual acts.\n\nDuring the same month, detectives seized a number of electronic devices from his home to capture evidence of chat logs, images and identified usernames he was using online. McMonagle was interviewed and charged to attend court in relation to the identified offences. \"Let this serve as a warning, we are everywhere. If you are attempting to communicate with a child online in a sexual way, you will be caught and you will face the full force of the law when you are,\u201d Ch Supt Fisher said.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Sinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said \"justice has been served\". \"I voice my appreciation to the system that has brought McMonagle to book and he will now be behind bars,\" she said. McMonagle had worked as a newspaper journalist in Derry before being employed as a Sinn F\u00e9in press officer in the north west. He was also an adviser for the party at Stormont for a number of years. In September it was revealed that two Sinn F\u00e9in press officers gave references for McMonagle, their former colleague, after he had been arrested and suspended from the party, but before he had appeared in court.",
    "'Everyone flew through the air': Survivors describe Israeli strike on Beirut that killed 18\n\n\u201cThere are no Hezbollah here,\u201d this distressed woman said. \u201cWe are all civilians\u201d\n\nMohammed Sukayneh picked his way through slabs of rubble and twisted metal, clutching a few plastic bags - all he could recover from his home of 45 years. It was brought down on top of him and his family last night by an Israeli airstrike, that killed at 18 people, four of them children, according to Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry. The attack happened without warning in a place where people thought they would be safe \u2013 about 150 metres from the entrance to Lebanon\u2019s largest public hospital, the Rafik Hariri hospital in southern Beirut. Mohammed and his family were asleep in their beds. \u201cWe didn't recognise what is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the strike we hear the sound like \u2018boom, boom, boom, boom\u2019 like this. And everything is thrown on us. Stones, metal, steel, fresh blood, fresh meat on us.

    "Is Smith England's next number three?\n\nJamie Smith scored his fourth Test fifty to help England recover from 118-6\n\nJamie Smith is fast becoming England\u2019s man for a crisis. The wicketkeeper\u2019s six-laden 89 reversed the momentum on the first day of the deciding Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. At 118-6, England were in danger of being overwhelmed by the pitch, patio heaters and Sajid Khan\u2019s moustache. The tourists had played some bang average shots. Smith\u2019s knock, with a bit of help from his Surrey mucker Gus Atkinson, got England to a competitive 267. Pakistan stumbled to 73-3 at the close, leaving the visitors favourites to win the series. At the age of 24 and with just nine caps to his name, Smith is developing the knack of making runs when England need them most. This was his fifth score in excess of 50 and three of the other four have also come from perilous positions: 95 from 169-6 against West Indies at Edgbaston, 111 from 125-4 against Sri Lanka at Old Trafford (as well as an important 39 in a tight chase in the same match) and 69 from 82-7 against the Lankans at The Oval. \"I don\u2019t mind those situations because there\u2019s not too much to lose and everything to gain,\" said Smith. \"You're not thinking about the game situation, you're thinking about how you can impose your skills and hopefully it comes off.\"\n\nThis latest rescue act may be the most important knock in Smith\u2019s short career. It is all the more impressive given the last match, England\u2019s defeat in the second Test in Multan, was his worst with the Three Lions on his chest. A struggle with the bat \u2013 he made 21 and six \u2013 was in step with the rest of the England team, but the drop of a simple chance off Brydon Carse on the third afternoon was perhaps their last hope of getting into the game. Smith probably won\u2019t drop an easier one in his time as a Test cricketer, the miss made worse by Joe Root putting down another catch in the same over. Ben Stokes let out his frustration on the field, a rarity for the England skipper, who later apologised to the team in the dressing room. \"You move on to another game,\" said Smith. \"I didn't score the runs I would have liked and dropped a catch which could have proven crucial, but those things happen in sport. \"There will definitely be times where that will happen again, but it's dusting yourself off and coming again to the next game with a smile on your face, looking to enjoy playing and trying to influence results.\" Short of catching bullets in his teeth, there is very little Smith can do to persuade those who believe Ben Foakes should still be in the England team as the best pure gloveman in the country. As the second-choice keeper to Foakes at Surrey, Smith will be all too aware of the difference in their respective abilities. Smith is hardly a stopper to whom England have attached a pair of gloves. He has come through the ranks as a keeper. Most importantly, he was chosen for innings like Rawalpindi, the kind of knock Foakes is not suited to play. England found themselves in a similar situation against India in Ranchi earlier this year, in need of runs, with their wicketkeeper only afforded the lower-order for company. India dropped the field and Foakes was powerless to penetrate it. In contrast, Smith was able to move through the gears against Pakistan. He was beaten in England\u2019s six-hitting competition in Wednesday\u2019s training session, even though he landed the biggest blow of anyone in the squad. On Thursday there was no doubt over the identity of the maximum man, as Smith plonked half a dozen over the rope. \"It was more luck than judgement, because on another day some of them are out,\" he said. \"That\u2019s how I like to play my cricket, I\u2019ll take it on regardless of the field. If I feel that\u2019s the best option, I\u2019ll be taking it.\"\n\nSmith averages more than 45 with the bat in his nine Tests\n\nIf Smith is growing into his role in the England side, Ollie Pope appears to be shrinking. Out sweeping Sajid for three, he has not passed 29 in the series. This latest failure worsened a curious statistic and unwanted record. Of all players in Test history to score three hundreds in a calendar year, like Pope has in 2024, no-one has a worse average in the same 12-month period. It is feast or famine. England have invested a huge amount in Pope, promoting him to number three and vice-captain. He is a thorough team man, as shown in the first Test against Pakistan, when he stepped up to open in place of the injured Ben Duckett despite more than two days in the field deputising as captain for Stokes. He was rewarded with a duck. \"Ollie Pope is in a really curious place,\" former England pace bowler Steven Finn told the Test Match Special podcast. \"His hundreds have been fantastic, but when you look at the great number threes for England they have that calming presence when they walk to the crease. \"Clearly England like and back Pope but is he batting out of position at number three? Probably.\" Pope can be a match-winner for England, as shown by his epic 196 against India in Hyderabad earlier this year. He will get more chances on the tour of New Zealand, yet that is where danger to his place also lies. Smith will miss some or all of the series for the birth of his first child, leaving the uncapped Jordan Cox to cover. If Cox makes a compelling case to remain in the team, like Harry Brook did when Jonny Bairstow got injured, might Pope be squeezed out? Smith, with his solid technique and unflappable temperament, could be England\u2019s long-term answer at number three, leaving the gloves with Cox in the process. Finn has an alternative solution. \"If Pope were to be dropped, asking Root to go up to number three might be the solution to leave Brook at four, Smith at five and Stokes at six,\" he said. Root, England\u2019s greatest run-scorer, is best-qualified for job, but the ship may have sailed. Re-opening the Joe-Root-to-number-three debate is like asking if Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard can play in the same midfield together. Smith has taken the England place of one Surrey team-mate in Foakes. Is Pope next?\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",
    "Aslan Bzhania has been Abkhazia's leader since 2020\n\nThe leader of Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia is resigning after days of mass protests over a controversial pro-Russia bill. Aslan Bzhania's press office said he was quitting \"to maintain stability and constitutional order\" and that the two sides had agreed protesters who had stormed the parliament in Sukhumi must disperse on Tuesday. The bill, which would have legalised Russian investment and land ownership, has been withdrawn. Abkhazia declared its independence in 1999, and Russia recognised it as an independent state after the Georgian-Russian war in 2008. Georgia says Abkhazia is \"occupied\" by Moscow.\n\nMost countries regard the area on the Black Sea coast as part of Georgia.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram late on Monday, Bzhania's press office said Abkhazia's parliament would consider his resignation on Tuesday. It said Bzhania's deputy would become Abkhazia's acting leader, who would then dismiss the current prime minister. The statement warned that Bzhania would withdraw his resignation offer if protesters refused to leave the government buildings. Bzhania describes himself as Abkhazia's president - Georgia and most of the world do not recognise his authority. Abkhazia's opposition has not commented on Bzhania's resignation offer. Located along the Black Sea and Caucasus mountains, Abkhazia is known for its natural beauty and coastline, and was one of the favoured holiday destinations for the Soviet elite until the collapse of the USSR in 1991. Locals feared that the proposed bill would trigger an influx of Russian investment, pricing them out of the property market and further strengthening Moscow's grip on the region. Backed by Russia, Abkhazia fought a war of secession with Georgia in 1992-93, before unilaterally declaring independence. In 2009, Moscow signed a five-year agreement with Abkhazia to take formal control of its frontiers with the rest of Georgia, while in 2014 Moscow and Sukhumi signed a \"strategic partnership\" agreement.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

    "Food prices soared in Gaza after the looting of nearly 100 UN aid lorries this month\n\nAmid severe food shortages in Gaza, increasingly violent thefts by criminal gangs are now the main obstacle to distributing supplies in the south, aid workers and locals say. They allege that armed men operate within plain sight of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a restricted zone by the border. The BBC has learnt that Hamas - sensing an opportunity to regain its faltering control - has reactivated a special security force to combat theft and banditry.\n\nAfter gangsters robbed nearly 100 UN lorries, injuring many of the Palestinian drivers, on 16 November - one of the worst single losses of aid during the war - a number of alleged looters were then killed in an ambush. A notorious Gazan criminal family then blocked the main Salah al-Din Road leading from Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing point for two days last week. Witnesses said iron barriers were erected and lorries trying to access the aid distribution point were fired at. \u201cLaw and order have broken down in the area around the Kerem Shalom crossing, which remains the main entry point of goods, and gangs are filling the power vacuum,\u201d says Sam Rose, deputy director of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in Gaza.\n\nHeavy rains and high waves have flooded tented camps for displaced Palestinians across Gaza, including Deir al-Balah\n\nAs the rainy winter weather begins, humanitarian officials say solving the worsening situation is critical to meet the huge, deepening needs of most of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population - now displaced to the centre and south. \u201cIt is tactical, systematic, criminal looting,\u201d says Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN\u2019s humanitarian office, Ocha, in Gaza. He says this is leading to \u201cultra-violence\u201d in all directions - \u201cfrom the looters towards the truckers, from the IDF towards the police, and from the police towards the looters\u201d. There has been increased lawlessness in Gaza since Israel began targeting police officers early this year, citing their role in Hamas governance. \u201cHamas\u2019s security control dropped to under 20%,\u201d the former head of Hamas police investigations told the BBC, adding: \u201cWe are working on a plan to restore control to 60% within a month.\u201d Some displaced Gazans in the south welcome the new Hamas efforts against criminal gangs. \u201cKilling the thieves who stole aid is a step in the right direction,\u201d exclaims one man, Mohammed Abu Jared. However, others see them as a cynical attempt to take control of lucrative black markets. \u201cHamas is killing its competitors in stealing aid,\u201d says Mohammed Diab, an activist in Deir al-Balah. \u201cA big mafia has finished off a small mafia.\u201d\n\nAid agencies say there has been a stark increase in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza\n\nMany see Hamas\u2019s attempts to take a lead against the criminality as the direct consequence of Israels\u2019 failure to agree on a post-war plan in Gaza. There are currently no alternatives to replace the Islamist movement and armed group which Israeli leaders pledged to destroy after last year\u2019s deadly 7 October attacks. The chaos comes at a time when aid entering the Palestinian territory has dropped to some of the lowest levels since the start of the war. While the threat of famine is greatest in besieged parts of the north where Israel is conducting a new, intense military offensive, in the south there are also major shortages of food, medicines and other goods. \u201cPrices of basic commodities are sky-rocketing - a bag of flour costs more than $200 (\u00a3160), a single egg $15 - or else goods are simply not available,\u201d Sam Rose of Unrwa says. Every day in the past week, Umm Ahmed has stood with her children in a huge queue outside a bakery in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where ultimately some loaves are given out. \u201cMy children are very hungry every day. We can\u2019t afford the basics. It\u2019s constant suffering. No food, no water, no cleaning products, nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want much, just to live a decent life. We need food. We need goods to come in and be distributed fairly. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking for.\u201d\n\nUmm Ahmed says her children are going hungry every day\n\nThe US has been pressing for Israel to allow more aid lorries into Gaza. However, Israeli officials say that the main reason that their goal of 350 a day has not been reached is the inability of the UN and other international aid agencies to bring enough lorries to the crossings. Aid workers reject that. They are urgently calling for many entry restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities to be lifted, and for more crossing points to be opened and secured so they can collect and distribute supplies. They say the breakdown in public order needs to be addressed and that Israel, as an occupying power, is obliged to provide protection and security. The BBC was told that thefts often happen in clear sight of Israeli soldiers or surveillance drones - but that the army fails to intervene. Stolen goods are apparently being stored outside or in warehouses in areas under Israeli military control. The IDF did not respond to BBC requests for comment on how it combats organised looting and smuggling. It has previously insisted that it takes countermeasures and works to facilitate the entry of aid.\n\nIsrael is reportedly studying the option of using a private contractor to deliver aid\n\nEarly in the war, as food became increasingly scarce, desperate Gazans were sometimes seen stealing from incoming aid lorries. Soon, cigarette smuggling became a huge business with gangs holding up convoys at gunpoint after they arrived from Egypt\u2019s Rafah crossing and, after this shut in May, Kerem Shalom. A cigarette packet can sell for exorbitant amounts in Gaza: while a packet of 20 cost about 20 shekels ($5.40) before the war, now a single cigarette can cost 180 shekels ($48.60). Cigarettes are being found within the frames of wooden aid pallets and inside closed food cans, indicating that there is a regional racket involved in smuggling. For the past six weeks, the Israeli authorities have banned commercial imports, arguing that these benefit Hamas. This has added to the decrease in the supply of food, which is in turn driving the rise in armed looting. Stolen goods, from flour to winter shelters, sent as international donations and meant to be given as free handouts to needy people can only be bought at extortionate prices on Gaza\u2019s black market. Meanwhile, months\u2019 worth of donated supplies are being held back in Egypt due to hold-ups in aid delivery. In recent days, local media reports are suggesting that Israel is now studying the option of delivering aid to Gaza by means of a private, armed American security contractor. While nothing has yet been officially announced, aid workers are worried. Georgios Petropoulos of Ocha questions which donor countries would want supplies distributed this way. \u201cHow safe is it really going to be?\u201d he asks: \u201cI think it will be a vector for more bloodshed and violence.\u201d",

Russian state-run news agencies reported that the country's security service FSB accused the diplomat - whose photo was shared on Russian TV bulletins - of providing false information on his documents and carrying out espionage activities. When asked if a tit-for-tat expulsion would occur, a No 10 spokesman said they were \"considering\" their response. \"To be clear, we refute these allegations\" he said, calling them \"baseless.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the ministry had also summoned the British ambassador, Tass news agency reported. Footage shows the British ambassador's car pulling up to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow. According to Tass, the FSB says that the diplomat was a replacement for one of six UK diplomats expelled in August, also on espionage charges. \"This is not the first time that [Vladimir] Putin's government has made malicious, baseless accusations against our staff,\" Downing Street said. \"The UK government is unapologetic about protecting our national interests and will now respond in due course, and our embassy in Moscow will continue its important work in Russia to support UK interests.\"\n\nIt comes amid worsening relations between the UK and Russia since the latter's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Last week it emerged the UK lifted restrictions on Ukraine using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles on targets inside Russia for the first time. President Vladimir Putin cited the move, alongside the launching of US-supplied longer-range missiles at Russian territory, as being behind Russia's decision to launch a new hypersonic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday. Expulsions of diplomats have become increasingly common since the war began. Earlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attach\u00e9 was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an \"undeclared military intelligence officer\". More British politicians and press have also been barred from entering the country. On Tuesday, Russia added 30 more to their \"stop list\" for what it called \"hostile actions\". Included in the list are: Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood. Russia has previously banned British politicians and journalists, including from the BBC, Sky News and Channel 4.

    "Harrods in the process of settling over 250 claims against Al Fayed\n\nHarrods has told the BBC it is engaging in the process of settling more than 250 claims for compensation brought by women who allege historical sexual misconduct by Mohamed Al Fayed. The department store said the women have come forward since the release of a BBC documentary more than four weeks ago. The investigation exposed decades of serious sexual abuse allegations against the former Harrods owner. Harrods has previously said it has already settled a number of claims. Fayed owned Harrods between 1985 and 2010. Its new owners have previously said they are \"appalled\" by allegations of sexual abuse by Al Fayed and have been investigating since last year whether any current members of staff were involved.\n\nThe company said it would not provide a \"running commentary\" of its internal review. Harrods has a compensation scheme for ex-employees who say they were attacked by Al Fayed, which is separate from a legal case against the luxury department store being brought forward by several different law firms. Justice for Harrods Survivors group, who represent the accusers of the former Harrods boss, said their lawyers were working with 147 women. It is unclear if there is some overlap between the women seeking compensation from Harrods and those pursuing legal action. The billionaire businessman, who died last year aged 94, is accused of multiple counts of rape and attempted rape by several women who worked for him - many of whom felt unable to report what had happened until recently. At the time of many of the alleged attacks, Fayed was the owner of Harrods, the Ritz Paris hotel and football club Fulham FC. He was a well-known public figure who had links to senior figures in Parliament and courted royalty and celebrities alike.\n\nThe BBC heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-employees at Harrods during its investigation for the documentary and podcast - Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods.

At the ceremony in Edinburgh, Swinney said it was a chance for generations of Scots to honour those who \u201cpaid the ultimate price\u201d in conflicts across the globe. \u201cMy uncle laid down his life to protect his colleagues and his comrades,\u201d he told BBC Scotland News.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother lost her son and grieved until the day of her death and my mother felt the same, so in this Remembrance Sunday, I particularly think of the sacrifice that he made and the family, who mourned him for all the days of their lives. \u201cIt is central to our understanding of our freedoms and our democracy today that we understand the sacrifices which were made by previous generation to make sure we could live in the type of society we live in.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is because people paid the ultimate price in the First and Second World Wars to ensure our freedom and in many other wars since then. \u201cWe must remember, particularly in the modern world, with conflict raging around us, the important sacrifices that were made for our freedoms.\u201d\n\nDozens of people gathered for the laying of wreaths at George Square in Glasgow\n\nThree-year-old Poppy was among those paying tribute in Dunblane\n\nIn Glasgow\u2019s George Square, mourners joined veterans and current service personnel in laying wreaths, with a guard of honour presented by representatives of the Royal Navy.

    "The Treasury has given its clearest indication yet it will change its self-imposed debt rule in order to borrow billions to fund new infrastructure projects. Independent checks on spending for major building work will be introduced to allow the government to borrow for investment \"more efficiently\", the Treasury Chief Secretary, Darren Jones, has said. He claimed the safeguards on spending will aim to avoid a repeat of the financial turmoil which followed the 2022 mini-Budget under former Prime Minister Liz Truss. New watchdogs will oversee a 10-year strategy for a pipeline of major projects, in areas such as buildings, roads and rail.\n\nWhat the government is calling the \"guardrails\" for infrastructure spending will form part of its aim to encourage the private sector to invest in British projects. Under this plan, \"expert-led checks and balances\" will determine the quality of government borrowing for investment.\n\nAt the moment, the amount of money the government can borrow for investment is restrained by the amount of debt it has. There is a self-imposed rule that debt \u2013 the total amount the government owes \u2013 must fall in five years\u2019 time. Many rich countries have similar rules, to keep government finances under control and maintain credibility with financial markets and taxpayers. But the Treasury has effectively confirmed it will loosen the target in order to borrow billions more to invest in a range of major projects. Ahead of the Budget on 30 October, Jones said the guardrails on spending would allow the government to borrow for investment \"more efficiently going forward\". He said these guardrails were in contrast to the Truss government's \"borrowing for unfunded policies\". During her brief premiership in 2022, Truss used her mini-Budget to unveil \u00a345bn in unfunded tax cuts in an attempt to boost economic growth. Jones said: \"We need expert, institutional and some independent guardrails to make sure everybody has confidence in the way that the government is spending taxpayer money. \"What I'm confirming today is we put those in place for capital investment and infrastructure delivery.\" The changes will include a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority that will oversee a 10-year strategy for a pipeline of major projects, aligned with a series of Spending Reviews, and long-term budgets for investment in, for example, buildings, roads and rail. The National Audit Office and a new Office for Value for Money will also offer ongoing appraisals of \u201cmega projects\u201d such as major train lines. The government said the moves would \u201cdepoliticise\u201d infrastructure decisions and offer \u201cindependent checks and balances\u201d against government, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nIn the government\u2019s view this system will provide an independent quality control on major projects spending, that has been beset with delay and overspend, and proved more expensive in the UK than other major economies. Ministers argue that the current debt rule has led to poor quality UK public services by constraining some necessary investment, and has also allowed spending on failing projects. A Cabinet minister told the BBC: \u201cWhen we do invest in projects we will make sure they deliver genuine value for money, they bring a return on investment and they deliver for communities. \"The Conservatives wasted billions of taxpayers\u2019 pounds on ministerial pet projects that never delivered and were about trying to buy votes. The Budget will be about changing that.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes as the government faces scrutiny over how it will choose to spend money in the Budget at the end of October. On Wednesday, several ministers wrote to the prime minister to call for an eleventh-hour rethink of the spending review, which they worry will see their departments' budgets slashed. Jones's comments come alongside the government's introduction of a \"taskforce\" for infrastructure spending - a group of private sector bosses including from HSBC, Lloyds and M&G - who will advise government on where to invest for infrastructure. The government has said its top priority is boosting growth in the UK's economy, and the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said increasing investment in infrastructure was a \"vital part\" of achieving this. On Monday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hosted a major investment summit to try to attract billions of pounds into the UK from international investors. He told the summit he would scrap regulation that \"holds back investment\" and would ask regulators to prioritise economic growth.\n\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

    "Six hours at hands of Hamas - new accounts reveal how Israeli base fell on 7 October\n\nOne year on from the 7 October Hamas attacks, tough questions are still being asked within Israel about the deadliest day in its history, when the country's powerful army was caught off guard and swiftly overwhelmed. The BBC has heard accounts given to families of what happened at one military base that guarded the border with Gaza. The Nahal Oz base was overrun by Hamas gunmen on the morning of 7 October and more than 60 Israeli soldiers are reported to have been killed - with others taken hostage. Israel\u2019s military is yet to publish its official inquiry into what happened there that day, but it has already briefed relatives of those killed there, and some have shared those details with the BBC. This is the closest we have to an official account by Israel\u2019s military of what happened on the day. In an attempt to further piece together events, we have also spoken to survivors, seen messages from those who died, and listened to voice recordings reporting the attack as it happened, helping to build a picture of the speed and ferocity of the invasion.\n\u2022 None Suspicious activity was spotted by many soldiers at the base before 7 October, not just the young women whose job it was to monitor border cameras\n\u2022 None Soldiers noticed an abrupt stop to Hamas activity in the days before the attack\n\u2022 None Many Israeli troops there were unarmed and official protocols had soldiers standing back when under attack, instead of advancing\n\u2022 None Some surveillance equipment was either out of action or able to be destroyed by Hamas with ease\n\nThe details we have established raise questions - including why so few soldiers were armed at a base so close to the border, why more wasn\u2019t done to respond to the intelligence and warnings that had been received, how it took so long for reinforcements to arrive, and whether the very infrastructure of the base had left those there unprotected. We put our findings to the IDF, who responded to say it was in the midst of a \u201cthorough investigation into the events of October 7th, including those in Nahal Oz, and the circumstances preceding\u201d. On 7 October, Sharon - not her real name - began her shift at Nahal Oz, about a kilometre from the Gaza border fence, at 04:00. She was part of the base\u2019s all-women military unit - known as Tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew - and their role was to study live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the fence. The women worked in shifts in the base\u2019s war room, or Hamal, watching Gaza through a bank of monitors around the clock. The Hamal is a windowless room protected by a solid door and blast walls, with strict security protocols. The IDF has told families of people on the base that day that many military staff were unarmed. Gen Israel Ziv, former head of the IDF's Operations Division, told the BBC that during his service, there would never have been unarmed soldiers in border areas. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 The soldier is about the weapon,\u201d he says. The armed staff at Nahal Oz that day included a unit of infantry soldiers from the IDF\u2019s Golani brigade. The BBC has previously reported that the Tatzpitaniyot had noticed an escalation in suspicious activity on the other side of the fence, but we have now established that these concerns were also shared by other soldiers at the base from different units.\n\nIn the days shortly before 7 October, however, things had gone quiet. \u201cThere was nothing and that was frightening us,\u201d one infantry soldier stationed at the base recalls.\u201cEverybody felt that something was strange. It didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d The IDF's failure to grasp what was happening was down to \u201ca lot of arrogance\u201d, says Gen Ziv, the thought that \u201cHamas wouldn\u2019t attack, wouldn\u2019t dare, and that even if so, they are not capable\u201d. \u201cWe went to sleep on the 6th thinking there\u2019s a cat over there and we woke up on the 7th and there\u2019s a tiger.\u201d At 05:30, members of the Golani prepared to begin a jeep patrol along the Israeli side of the fence - something they did before dawn every morning. But they were then instructed by their superiors to delay the patrol and stand back because of a threat of anti-tank missiles, three of them have told the BBC. \u201cThere was a warning. It was forbidden to go up the route next to the fence,\u201d one recalls. Another Golani, 21-year-old Shimon Malka, said such a warning was unusual but not unheard of, so they gave it little thought.\n\nIDF infantry soldier Shimon Malka: \u201cFor us, it was just another day. I remember at 6 o\u2019clock saying we\u2019ll go back to sleep because it\u2019s Saturday.\u201d\n\nGen Ziv says it is standard IDF protocol to stand people back during suspected attacks like this so they can \u201cavoid being exposed as a target\u201d. But, he says, \u201cHamas realised that and used it\u201d to their advantage. He said the base should have been equipped with positions that the Golani could safely respond from. \u201cThere are very simple techniques to cover soldiers so they\u2019re under cover but they\u2019re still in a position to react, to not lose sight,\u201d he said. As the Golani waited away from the fence, Sharon began seeing movements among Hamas fighters. But they seemed nothing other than routine - \u201cthey also have shifts.\u201d\n\nBy 06:20 Hamas had begun shooting rockets, but again Sharon says this did not seem immediately alarming - she had experienced rocket attacks before and the base was well-shielded against them. \u201cIt\u2019s usually five minutes of shooting and then a break,\u201d she says. But this time, there was no break.\n\nAt about 06:30, Sharon says she could see Hamas forces beginning to close in. The Tatzpitaniyot radioed through to the ground forces to alert them. \u201cAll stations, four people running to the fence, copy,\u201d one of the young women announced, her voice shaking slightly. \"I am identifying two armed people running to the fence, copy.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Listen to Roni Eshel's radio message: \"I am identifying two armed people running to the fence.\" Roni later died in the 7 October attacks\n\nAbout the same time, Shimon heard the code words for a rocket attack through his radio. His commander ordered they jump from their jeep into a Namer - a type of Israeli armoured personnel carrier - and head towards the fence. But he couldn\u2019t see any incursions and assumed it was just a drill. This so-called iron wall had long been viewed by the IDF and people across Israel as impenetrable, and yet bases along it began reporting breaches. Each of the Tatzpitaniyot on shift at Nahal Oz witnessed between two and five breaches of the section of border fence they were responsible for monitoring, says Sharon. They watched as Hamas fighters made their way inside Israel. Gen Ziv says the ease with which fighters had crossed the fence showed the flaws in a barrier perceived to be impenetrable. \u201cAs you saw, two truck-loads could come and push it. It was nothing. Even if there was a minefield of 50 or 60 metres over there, it would have delayed Hamas for a few hours.\u201d\n\nShortly before 06:40, an observation post at Nahal Oz was hit and damaged by a rocket, according to IDF family briefing notes shared with the BBC. A sniper-sighting system was put into action from the Hamal - the nerve centre of the base - and an officer attempted to shoot remotely at gunmen trying to cross the border, the IDF told families. Infantry officers joined the Tatzpitaniyot in the Hamal, too. Sharon remembers one commander arriving in her pyjamas. And then, as gunmen continued to shoot at surveillance cameras, the monitoring screens in the Hamal started to go dark. The fact that Hamas had been operating in plain sight of these surveillance cameras, along the border in the weeks before, was tactical, says Gen Ziv, in order to \u201cnormalise things\u201d. Just 100 metres from where the Tatzpitaniyot were working, Alroy - one of the five IDF observation balloonists on site that morning - was woken by the rockets and the sirens, his father Rafi Ben Shitrit told the BBC. The IDF later provided details of an initial investigation to Alroy\u2019s family about what happened that day. The balloon at Nahal Oz offered a deeper view into Gaza, and was supposed to be operational 24 hours a day. But on 7 October it was one of three along the border that were out of action.\n\n\u201cThe balloon in Nahal Oz didn't work and no-one was stressed, they were told it would be fixed on Sunday,\u201d says Mr Ben Shitrit. \u201cThere was an atmosphere like: \u2018Hamas is deterred, even if something happens it's a terrorist infiltration or at most a terrorist squad.\u2019\u201d Back at her surveillance point, Sharon carried on frantically communicating with soldiers on the ground. \u201cI cried and announced, simultaneously,\u201d she says. She remembers that the commanding officer yelled for \u201cquiet\u201d because some of the young women were losing focus amid the horror. At the fence, Shimon says he followed the radio directions. He still couldn\u2019t understand why the young woman\u2019s voice he was hearing sounded so panicked. \u201cI could feel the stress, but I couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201d When his unit reached the place the Tatzpitaniyot had directed them to, they saw Hamas trucks breaking through the fence. \u201cThey started to shoot at us. Maybe five trucks.\u201d The soldiers shot back and ran over those on motorbikes.\n\nShortly after 07:00 came the moment everyone feared and nobody could imagine. Hamas gunmen were at the door of the Hamal. \u201cGet up, the terrorists are at the door,\u201d Sharon remembers being told. The Tatzpitaniyot were ordered to abandon their positions and head to an office inside the war room. Gen Ziv says that those higher up in the military did not put enough emphasis on defending the bases themselves, focusing instead on external patrols. \u201cThat was part of the whole mess because once the enemy surprised them and went into the base they were not ready. The whole thing collapsed,\u201d he says.\n\nAt about 07:20 what was known as the shield - a bomb shelter outside the Hamal - was attacked. Among those sheltering inside were some off-duty Tatzpitaniyot, who were being protected by \u201cfour female warriors\u201d, according to a WhatsApp message sent at 07:38 by one of the Tatzpitaniyot sheltering there and seen by the BBC. There were no further messages from her in the group. The IDF told families that these \u201cfemale warriors\u201d were the only armed people hiding in the shelter - and they kept Hamas fighters at bay with their gunfire until a grenade explosion killed one of the commanders and injured others inside. At this point, about 10 of the soldiers managed to escape the shelter and locked themselves in the accommodation barracks. Everyone else in the shield was either killed or captured by Hamas. Shimon and his commander headed back to the base, but they still weren\u2019t aware of the scale of what was happening. The IDF would later brief the family of one of those killed at Nahal Oz that the attack on the base was begun by drone strikes, and action by 70 fighters from four directions, and that scores more joined as the morning went on.\n\nUp and down the Gaza Strip, thousands crossed into Israeli territory. On his way back to base Shimon says he began to comprehend the scale of the attack. \u201cWhen we got to the base, everything was burned,\u201d he says. In the office inside the Hamal, Sharon says the group of about 20 soldiers tried to calm each other down. Meanwhile, they made repeated attempts to call for more support. \u201cI guess [someone] said something like \u2018There\u2019s no backup, no-one can come,\u2019 and I remember my officer said \u2018We don\u2019t need backup, we need rescue.\u2019\u201d\n\nShortly before 08:00 an Israeli drone, known as a Zik, arrived, but it had difficulty distinguishing between Israeli soldiers and Hamas, according to the IDF account, which meant it was slower to attack its intended targets. At about the same time, an attack began on the Hamal, with lots of shooting. Those armed fought at the doors of the building to prevent Hamas from getting inside. The fighting continued for about four hours. Meanwhile, Shimon says he and other soldiers fighting at the base were completely outnumbered. There was no sign of reinforcements. At about 09:00, the Golani headed to the base\u2019s dining room where the Tatzpitaniyot had told them most of the gunmen were hiding. Relatives would later be told by the IDF that there were 150 gunmen to every 25 combat soldiers entering Nahal Oz that day. \u201cWhat Hamas was doing that morning was swarming,\u201d says Gen Ziv. \u201cThere were over 70 different breaches\u2026 over 3,000 terrorists\u2026 They knew they didn\u2019t have the quality so they had to go quantity.\u201d A video, which Israeli media reports was filmed around this time, shows young surveillance officers at Nahal Oz, who had been captured by armed Hamas. \u201cYou dogs, we will step on you,\u201d one man is heard saying as the women\u2019s hands are tied, their faces against the wall.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Dr Ayelet Levy's daughter Naama was taken hostage from Nahal Oz by Hamas. \"My daughter is a very strong girl,\" she says\n\nNineteen-year-old Naama Levy, who had only started at the base the previous day, pleads that she has \u201cfriends in Palestine\u201d, her face covered in blood. The footage shows the women being dragged into a waiting vehicle and driven away. It is devastating for Naama\u2019s mother to watch. \u201cThe wounds, the blood, what she was saying, what the terrorists were saying to them, the horror of those moments,\u201d says Dr Ayelet Levy. Gen Ziv says the Tatzpitaniyot at Nahal Oz \u201cwere amazing - the mistake was the system, the commanders, not them\u201d.\n\nMore than three hours after the attack had begun, at 09:45, an IDF helicopter started firing at the Hamas gunmen, officers told grieving relatives. It fired into the base 12 times. Shimon and six others, including their commander, drove out of the base and returned in formation on foot. He says they were fired on \u201cfrom all directions\u201d. Through the sound of automatic gunfire would come a series of single shots, fired by a Hamas sniper they couldn\u2019t see. \u201cEvery time he shot, one of my friends got a bullet in the head,\u201d he says. Shimon says he was the only one of those fighting alongside him to survive, and he too, had a near miss. \u201cA bullet passed right by my head\u2026 I could hear the bullets hitting the concrete around me and feel the heat from them.\u201d At this point, he says his radio was no longer operational. \u201cFor so many hours the backup was not there because nobody knew exactly what was going on and where to send the backup,\u201d he explains. Shimon escaped the scene and moved to a sniper's position before joining with soldiers from another unit who went to protect a kibbutz.\n\nBack in the Hamal, or war room, there was a significant development at about 11:00. The electricity was cut which meant the locks to the doors, which were on an electric system, were released. It left the war room wide open, according to the IDF account given to several families. Hamas fighters began shooting inside and throwing grenades. One was killed in a face-to-face knife fight with a Golani soldier, the IDF told families. Gen Ziv said at the point that soldiers were relying on door locks for their safety, the broader military system had \u201calready failed\u201d. In the IDF\u2019s briefing to families it said \u201cterrorists threw a flammable substance into the Hamal and set it on fire\u201d.\n\nWhat was left of the smoke and fire-damaged war room\n\n\u201cThe smoke was really thick. Everyone started to cough and suffocate. People start to fall and faint,\u201d recalls Sharon. One mother says she was told by the IDF that a \u201ctoxic substance\u201d had been used by Hamas, external in the attack, though others were not aware of this detail or said the IDF had since changed its account on this.\n\nAt about 12:30, seven people in the Hamal - including Sharon - managed to feel their way to the toilet window and climb out, according to accounts of those there that day. There, she and the other survivors waited for more to follow. But no-one came. Sharon was the only survivor among the Tatzpitaniyot on shift that day. One other young woman in the unit, who was at the base but not working that morning, also survived. By the end of 7 October, the military had regained control, but many of those stationed there did not survive the day. Seven Tatzpitaniyot were taken back to Gaza as hostages, where one was killed, another rescued and five still remain.\n\nTwo fire-damaged workstations in the Hamal\n\nAcross Israel that day, about 1,200 people - including more than 300 soldiers - were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli military action in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The Nahal Oz dead were to include Alroy the balloonist and four comrades, who had engaged in a lengthy battle with Hamas, says his father, citing information given to him by the IDF. They managed to kill close to 10 gunmen, he said, but the five were outnumbered and were all found dead inside a mobile shelter at 14:30. The war room - which had been designed as a safe space for the base\u2019s units - was destroyed. Photos and videos show it charred, the screens the Tatzpitaniyot had been carefully monitoring, blackened. Bone fragments were found among the ashes there. The survivors and the families of those killed and kidnapped are left with unanswered questions about how it went so wrong.",
    "A live performance of The Chunkz and Filly Show podcast has been cancelled after YouTuber Yung Filly was charged over rape allegations in Australia. The British rapper and online personality, real name Andres Felipe Valencia Barrientos, was arrested in Brisbane on Tuesday and extradited to Perth the following day to attend a court hearing. Barrientos, 29, was charged on Thursday and has had his bail application approved. His representatives have been contacted for comment.\n\nThe first live performance of his podcast with internet personality Chunkz was due to take place on 18 October in east London. The podcast, which first broadcast last year, sees the pair interview rappers and influencers. A spokeswoman told the BBC: \"The event was removed from our website yesterday and all ticket holders have been informed - their tickets will be refunded automatically.\" The BBC has contacted promoters Dice for comment. In a statement, Upload Productions, which produces the Chunkz and Filly Show podcast, said: \"We are aware of the serious allegations that have been made against Yung Filly and the legal proceedings that are now under way in Western Australia. \"In the commercial areas of business where we have responsibility, we have paused working with our client.\" Meanwhile, the Football Association (FA) has cancelled an online cookery series with Barrientos. On Wednesday, it had announced an online cookery series Barrientos was reported to star in alongside England footballers, including Bukayo Saka and Ezri Konsa. The series was in collaboration with M&S Food, which the BBC understands does not have a direct relationship with Yung Filly, and took part in one piece of filming as one of the FA's partners. The FA has been approached for comment. FootAsylum has also severed ties with Barrientos, who regularly appeared in their YouTube series Does the Shoe Fit? \u201cIn light of these extremely serious charges, we are suspending our contract with Yung Filly with immediate effect,\" a spokesperson said for FootAsylum. \"We are unable to comment further until the legal process has been concluded.\"\n\nYung Filly (right) presenting at the 2022 MOBO Awards with Chunkz\n\nThe full charges include four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm and one count of impeding a person's normal breathing or circulation by applying pressure on or to their neck. It is alleged he brought a woman in her 20s back to his hotel room after he had performed at the nightclub Bar1 in Perth. The attack is alleged to have taken place on 28 September. The influencer, with over three million followers on Instagram and nearly two million subscribers on YouTube, was in Australia touring his music.

    "England interim manager Lee Carsley's future is still shrouded in confusion\n\nEngland - and interim manager Lee Carsley - left Finland with a win to warm them against freezing temperatures but this has been an international camp riddled with chaos and confusion on and off the pitch. Carsley's side simply had to fly out of Helsinki victorious after the tactical debacle that brought defeat against Greece at Wembley on Thursday \u2013 and it was duly achieved, although in a far from convincing fashion. England's interim manager now has two more games, the tough trip to face Greece in Athens and a Wembley meeting with the Republic of Ireland in November, before the dizzying dance around whether he wants the job - or the Football Association actually want him to do it - must end. Carsley's public evasion of indicating any desire to commit beyond two more games has created uncertainty, all this with the clock ticking and the FA still not holding formal negotiations with any other potential targets to succeed Gareth Southgate on a permanent basis. England's two performances against Greece and Finland have not bolstered Carsley's claims, should he even want the post, so eventually someone \u2013 either the interim manager or more pertinently the FA \u2013 must bring clarity to this cloudy situation. The presumption must be that the FA knows Carsley's intentions. It would almost be a dereliction of duty if it were otherwise, but time is now running out to crystallise thoughts on what is arguably the biggest single decision the organisation has to take. His words in Helsinki were at first telling as he said: \"This job deserves a world-class coach that has won trophies and I am still on the path to that.\" Was this Carsley, an outstanding England Under-21 coach, admitting he does not possess the qualifications for the top job? It could be interpreted this way, but this has become an unsatisfactory word salad. He then insisted after the game that it is \"definitely\" wrong to say he has ruled himself out of the job, saying he is keeping an \"open mind\". Carsley's mixed messaging with the media has exacerbated the situation, with his thoughts and intentions on whether he wants the full-time job badly blurred. The interim manager appears highly reluctant to deliver a straight answer to the many very straight questions he is asked. Does he want the England job or not? It does not appear that difficult. He must surely know by now - but this needless dallying around the edge of the subject is now becoming faintly farcical.\n\nJack Grealish, who recently became a father for the first time, delivers a fitting celebration after putting England ahead in Finland\n\nFormer Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel fits the bill by Carsley's measure but international management is a different matter from leading a club. Newcastle's Eddie Howe is still mentioned, while any idea of luring Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to St George's Park is surely a dream, a fanciful one at that. The questions and second-guessing will continue until this is cleared up once and for all. It has created an inertia which will only be solved by someone, perhaps the FA, showing their hand. The received wisdom is the FA would like Carsley to be their man, continuing on the pathway - from St George's Park to under-21 coach and then national coach - forged by Southgate. At this stage, however, it appears they are no closer to putting a firm recruitment strategy in place. On whether he would like to carry on, Carsley repeated the lines consistently trotted out as he added: \"I've not really thought much about it. I keep saying the same thing. My remit was six games and I'm happy with that. \"This is a privileged position. I'm really enjoying it but I didn't enjoy the last two days. I'm not used to losing in an England team. I don't take losing well. \"People are always going to try and put their chips on one side. I'm in the middle. My bosses have made it clear what they need from me.\" Carsley's credentials to take England to the 2026 World Cup have taken a heavy hit since the victories against the Republic of Ireland and Finland in his opening two games. Just about everything about the 2-1 loss to Greece needs to be placed in the negative half of his ledger. He got his team selection horribly wrong, his front-loaded side stripped of a recognised striker were a tactical mess, and Carsley's suggestion he would \"hopefully\" return to the under-21 job crowned a truly dismal, head-scratching night for all involved. England won 3-1 in Finland. They had to win. Anything else was unthinkable against a gallant but limited side ranked 64th in the world and without a point in this Uefa Nations League Group B2. And yet, for long periods, England were slow, sterile and ponderous, even with the lift of Jack Grealish's early goal. The nerves would have been rattling had Finland striker Fredrik Jensen not spurned two big chances at 1-0, the second after the break a shocking miss when he somehow fired over the top with the goal at his mercy. England made Finland pay with further goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold, used at left-back in another Carsley break from convention, and Declan Rice, but this was not enough to blow away the cobwebs left from the loss to Greece. Grealish continued his rejuvenation with a goal but it was not a good night for Chelsea's Cole Palmer, marginalised on the right to little effect, with returning captain Harry Kane looking short of fitness. It was better than Greece. It could not be worse. England at least had a shape but they were making very hard work of seeing off Finland until Alexander-Arnold produced a very rare moment of quality with a brilliant free-kick from 25 yards. They were flat for long periods, lacking tempo and fluency. It was not an impressive dispatch of such inferior opposition. A win is a win, though, and that is at least a small mercy at the end of a highly unsatisfactory week on and off the pitch.",
    "Allison Pearson says she felt 'bullied' in police probe\n\nJournalist Allison Pearson said she felt \u201cbullied and threatened\u201d, after a visit from Essex Police during a since-dropped investigation into a social media post by her. The Daily Telegraph columnist told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme the home visit was not \"standard practice\" and was \"absolutely unacceptable\". Essex Police says officers paid Pearson a visit on 10 November to arrange an interview as part of an investigation into alleged incitement to racial hatred, following a complaint from a member of the public. The force has previously defended its actions. On Thursday it announced it had dropped the investigation and there will be an independent review into their handling of the matter.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Essex Police for a response to Pearson's latest comments. \"It is not standard practice to turn up on someone\u2019s doorstep when there is such a minor charge,\" Pearson told the BBC on Friday. She added: \"Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader and many other people in the law, in politics, in normal walks of life, have said that is totally outrageous.\" \"We have shown that tweet to many King's Counsels, to a former solicitor general, to two former home secretaries and to indeed, two very senior police officers - each one of them has said it does not come near to approaching the threshold for any kind of investigation.\" Pearson publicised the visit from police in an article she wrote in the Telegraph, in which she claimed she was told by the police who came to her home it was over a \u201cnon-crime hate incident\u201d, but was not told which post it was about. The force said body cam footage of the incident did not show its officers tell her the report being investigated was being treated as a \"non-crime hate incident\". A non-crime hate incident is where no criminal offence has been committed but the person reporting it believes the incident to be motivated by hostility. Essex Police defended its actions at the time, and said the officer stated that the complaint had \"gone down as an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online\".\n\nBut Pearson told the BBC the tweet did not warrant a home visit. \"They are under no obligation for such a small tweet to come to a person\u2019s house, and make them frightened, and I have had almost 10 days of real dread and tears and fear, and that is not acceptable.\" She said \"anyone can make an allegation and have it taken seriously\", adding the force has \"thousands\" of similar complaints, but does not investigate them all. \"This was wholly disproportionate... Why did Essex Police escalate it with me?\" she asked. The BBC has seen the now-deleted post the police complaint related to. It dates from 16 November 2023 and shows an image of two police officers standing next to two men holding what appears to be a flag of the Pakistani political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The post tags the Metropolitan Police alongside the words \u201chow dare they\u201d. It adds: \u201cInvited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.\u201d X added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it is \u201cnot related to Palestine\u201d. Pearson said she did not think her tweet was wrong, and added: \"I won\u2019t censor myself but I will be more watchful in the future.\" In a previous statement, Essex Police said officers \u201cwent to a residential address to arrange a time to do an interview with a woman about a complaint made by a member of the public\u201d. An Essex Police spokesperson previously said the force \"investigate crimes reported to us without fear or favour\". \"We\u2019re sometimes faced with allegations of crime where people have strong opposing views. That\u2019s why we work so hard to remain impartial and to investigate allegations, regardless of where they might lead.\" A number of political figures came out in support of Pearson, including shadow home secretary Chris Philp and former prime minister Boris Johnson - sparking a debate around free speech. Responding to the debate, Essex Police previously said it supports free speech but \"it does not support inaccuracy\". \"If an alleged crime is reported, it is investigated. There is no public interest in falsehood.\" The National Police Chiefs Council's hate crime lead has been asked to carry out an independent review of the force's handling of the matter. Roger Hirst, Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex, said it was \"important the public have confidence in their police service\". \"This investigation has caused significant distress for Ms Pearson and a large amount of public concern,\" he said. \"It has raised a number of important questions that need to be addressed so all of us can be confident the police are acting properly.\"",
    "Tool promised to help non-verbal people - but did it manipulate them instead?\n\nTim Chan says that without the tool, he wouldn't be able to live his life to the fullest\n\nFor Tim Chan, who is unable to speak, facilitated communication is \u201ca lifeline\u201d that allows him to do things he once thought impossible, such as socialising, or studying for his PhD. \u201cI was presumed incompetent, and ignored or dismissed,\u201d the 29-year-old, who was diagnosed with autism as a toddler, says using a text-to-voice tool in his home in Melbourne. Facilitated communication involves someone guiding the hand, arm or back of a non-verbal person, so that they can point to letters or words on a bespoke keyboard. Mr Chan\u2019s facilitator is his mother Sara, and, over the past 20 years, her support has \u201cfaded\u201d to a slight touch of his shoulder, which he says keeps him \u201cfocused\u201d. Advocates insist it is a miracle tool, one which gives disabled people a voice. But a growing chorus of experts, families and even former facilitators want it banned, due to research indicating that the likely author of the messages is the facilitator, not the communicator. They cite a string of criminal allegations made by non-verbal people using the method which have been dismissed by the courts and investigators. The debate has sparked allegations of ableism, ruined legacies, inspired a new Louis Theroux documentary, and an international conversation about the power dynamics between disabled people and those who care for them.\n\nFacilitated communication was created in 1977 by Australian disability advocate Rosemary Crossley, who died last year and left a complex legacy. To those who knew her, she\u2019s remembered as champion for \u201cpeople with little or no functional speech\u201d. But others say her communications invention - and her formidable defence of it - were misguided and harmful. It is still used worldwide, despite being widely criticised. The first notable subject to use facilitated communication was Anne McDonald, a non-verbal Australian woman with cerebral palsy, a severe intellectual disability, and no control over her limbs. At the time, Crossley claimed that McDonald - then 16 - could communicate by pointing at magnetic letters while Crossley supported her upper arm.\n\nRosemary Crossley invented facilitated communication in the 1970s, and Anne McDonald was the first person to use it\n\nWithin weeks McDonald was spelling out whole sentences and doing fractions, despite having no formal education and being institutionalised since age three. Some of Crossley\u2019s colleagues expressed surprise that McDonald, who\u2019d never read, could suddenly write eloquent prose, and cite literary references, when her arm was held by the highly educated Crossley. One who raised questions was the institution\u2019s head paediatrician and psychiatrist Dr Dennis Maginn, who wouldn\u2019t validate Crossley\u2019s communication theory without independent testing. McDonald later accused him, facilitated by Crossley\u2019s supported typing, of attempting to smother her to death with a pillow. Homicide investigators dismissed the claims, but his career never recovered. \u201cMy thoughtful, introspective and well-intentioned father went through living hell,\u201d his son, lawyer Paul Maginn, says, adding that \u201cany right-thinking person\u201d could see the allegation had been made up by Crossley. Crossley even had her own initial doubts about the technique, writing at the time: \u201cWhat I did not know was whether I was subconsciously manipulating [Anne] or imagining her hand movements.\u2019\u2019 McDonald - who ended up leaving the institution and living with Crossley - went on to use the method with other facilitators. She also earned a humanities degree and co-authored the book Annie\u2019s Coming Out, which was turned into an award-winning film. But despite all these achievements, McDonald\u2019s mother Beverley \u201cnever believed\u201d that her daughter could communicate: \u201cI asked her questions and got nowhere,\u201d she told the ABC in 2012, after her daughter died.\n\nFor Marlena Katene, facilitated communication has allowed her to \u201cconnect and say whatever I want\u201d. The 33-year-old Gold Coast native selects words using a keyboard. Her facilitator Bert, or a text-to-voice tool, then reads them aloud. Speaking to the BBC both with and without Bert, Ms Katene says it\u2019s \u201cfrustrating being constantly tested to be validated\u201d and that \u201ccommunication is about humanity more than science\u201d. She finds it alarming that some academics and disability advocacy organisations have led campaigns to disprove what she says is an effective method for thousands worldwide. But experts have uncovered different findings, using a \u2018double-blind\u2019 experiment. The method involves the facilitator and communicator being separated and given different prompts to study, such as a picture, before coming back together to take a test.\n\nMarlena says the method has allowed her to \"connect\"\n\nIn more than 30 empirical studies, the non-verbal person ends up typing the prompts the facilitator was shown, meaning there\u2019s no convincing evidence that messages written using facilitated communication are authored by the person with a disability. \u201cThe science just isn\u2019t there,\u201d Howard Shane, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, tells the BBC. Courts have reached the same conclusion. A bevy of parents and caregivers have found themselves on trial over allegations - often sexual abuse - unearthed by facilitated communication. Prof Shane has given evidence in 12 such cases - including that of Jose Cordero, who spent 35 days in a Miami jail and was barred from seeing his family for months after being accused, via a facilitator, of sexually abusing his seven-year-old autistic son. The case was dropped, citing a lack of credibility in facilitated communication. In every trial he\u2019s been involved in, testing proved the facilitator was the author of the accusations, Prof Shane says, or \u201cthey refused to participate\u201d in testing altogether, citing \u201canxiety\u201d. But one of the most high profile facilitated communication cases - now the subject of a Netflix documentary - questioned whether the method could be used to provide proof of consent.\n\nAnna Stubblefield was at the centre of one of the most controversial facilitated communication cases to make it to trial\n\nIn 2015, university professor Anna Stubblefield was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault for raping a non-verbal 33-year-old man with severe mental disabilities and cerebral palsy. Facilitated communication testimony from the man was ruled unreliable under New Jersey\u2019s test for scientific evidence. Two years later, an appeals court overturned Stubblefield\u2019s conviction, ordering a retrial on the basis that it was a violation of her rights to not allow her to use facilitated communication as a defence. In 2018 she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to time served. She maintains the relationship was consensual and that the two were \u201cintellectual equals in love\u201d. Prof Shane\u2019s controlled testing concluded that the man had the intellectual ability of a six-month-old. Testifying in Stubblefield\u2019s case James Todd, a psychology professor at Eastern Michigan University, argued that the university where Stubblefield received her training held some responsibility for the crime. He said Syracuse University was \u201cchampioning facilitated communication over clear and established science,\u201d and implored it to \u201crenounce and repudiate\u201d the technique for its \u201cdangerous harms.\u201d Syracuse University, one of the only universities with a facilitated communication institute, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThe BBC approached five different academic experts on facilitated communication worldwide to speak about the technique. All declined. At least 30 medical associations worldwide oppose facilitated communication. Many, such as the UK\u2019s National Autistic Society, warn that it\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d and able to cause \u201csignificant harm.\u201d Other opponents include the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, The American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Paediatrics and Speech Pathology Australia. These organisations cite peer-reviewed evidence indicating the technique is discredited pseudoscience and have flagged the risks it poses to disabled people, their families, and facilitators themselves, because of potential false allegations. Clinical psychologist Adrienne Perry has warned the non-verbal person \u201cis made a 'screen' for a facilitator's hostilities, hopes, beliefs or suspicions\u201d. For speech trainer Janyce Boynton - who did her facilitated communication training at the University of Maine - the discovery was shocking. She\u2019d been facilitating the communication of a 16-year-old non-verbal autistic girl, who\u2019d accused her father and brother of sexual abuse via Ms Boynton\u2019s facilitation. Prof Shane was called in to do a double-blind test with pictures. \u201cIt turned out, even though I believed in facilitated communication, I was the author of all the answers,\u201d Ms Boynton tells the BBC. \u201cIt was irrefutable. You just didn't realise it.\u201d It left her feeling \u201cterrible, confused and devastated\u201d. \u201cI believe most facilitators are sincere,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want to believe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nTim Chan is studying for a PhD and uses facilitated communication on a daily basis\n\nToday, Tim Chan types that such criticisms are \u201cextremely damaging\u201d. \u201cWe start doubting our ability to be a person in our own right,\u201d he says, via his mum\u2019s facilitation. He has never undertaken the double-blind test. \u201cTesting a person with non-verbal autism will make them very anxious. They process information differently,\u201d Ms Chan says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible there\u2019s some unconscious cueing going on. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she adds. Prof Shane and academic specialists in speech, communications, psychology, and developmental disabilities all say the technique should be banned. \u201cI recently worked on a case where somebody was in jail for a year before it finally emerged no testing was done,\u201d Prof Shane says. \u201cHe was released when testing showed the allegations were false.\u201d But facilitated communication is still practised in some specialised schools, disability centres and institutes in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Part of the reason, Prof Shane says, is that families and facilitators \u201cbelieve so strongly\u201d their child has hidden skills. \u201cThey need to accept the children for who they are - rather than what they'd like them to be.\u201d",
    "Nativity dolls of Kamal Harris and Donald Trump in Naples, Italy\n\nThe Guardian, external says the US is facing its \"moment of reckoning\" as voters choose either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump as their new president. The paper calls it an election like none before with a choice between a \"black woman and a former president branded a fascist by his own former officials\". The headline for the i, external is \"America decides - the world holds its breath\". It suggests that global leaders from Moscow and Kyiv to Beijing and Tehran are waiting to discover the future of the US. Its editor, Oliver Duff, suggests that Kamala Harris has fought an \"unimpressive campaign\" but he points out that the alternative is \"returning a convicted criminal to the White House\".\n\nThe Mirror, external's opinion column states simply \"Let's hope it's Kamala\". It concludes that Trump is \"no friend of Britain\". But the Sun seizes on a comment by Trump that the election is \"ours to lose\", external. It says the former president insists he is on the verge of a historic comeback. The Financial Times, external has front-page pictures of Harris and Trump side by side. It says that although the polls are \"razor thin\", the Democrats have been cheered by what they believe is a decided shift towards their candidate. Comments by Nigel Farage, external, a Trump ally, make the lead for the Daily Telegraph. It reports that Farage, who is attending Trump's election day party at his home in Florida, has advised his friend to accept the result of the election, if he loses decisively. He is quoted saying if that happens, Trump should \"go and play golf at Turnberry\".\n\nThe Daily Mail is unimpressed by the government's decision to allow universities in England to raise tuition fees, external for the first time in eight years. The headline is \"Now that's what you call a U-turn!\" But the Times, external is in favour of the move. Under the headline \"degree of confidence\", its opinion column argues that the cap on fees has left many universities teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. It thinks raising them amounts to a \"confrontation with reality\". Finally, the Sun leads on what it calls \"Oasis bust-up fears\". It suggests the organisers of the band's forthcoming re-union tour are so worried about the possibility of a fresh feud between Liam and Noel Gallagher, they are not going to pay the brothers their joint \u00a36m fee for each gig until they turn up. The headline is \"Be here now or you don't get paid\".\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "The week that pushed the Middle East closer to all-out war\n\nPeople evacuate a wounded man after an Israeli strike in Beirut on 4 October\n\nThere have been many moments of extreme danger over the past year. This is the worst. In the past seven days, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has been assassinated, Israel has launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, and Iran has fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at targets across Israel. Western and regional powers - led by the US - have pushed for de-escalation. The UN Security Council called for an \"immediate end\" to hostilities and the G7, which includes the US, UK and Germany, has called for \u201crestraint\u201d. But so far those efforts have failed - and the Middle East stands closer than ever to all-out war. Here\u2019s how the last week played out.\n\nAs the sun set over Beirut on 27 September, the south of the city was hit by a series of huge explosions. Several apartment buildings had been struck, leaving a huge crater in the ground. Plumes of dust and debris filled the skyline, visible from across the Lebanese capital. The strike, aimed at an underground bunker, killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Seen as a prize-target, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for years for fear of being assassinated by Israel. His death capped a week of ramped-up Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah that had left more than 500 people dead. The week before that, a series of walkie-talkie and pager explosions targeting the group left at least 32 dead and over 3000 injured. Nasrallah\u2019s death wiped all hopes of a de-escalation, which just hours earlier had seemed possible. A US proposal for a 21-day ceasefire had been discussed on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York. Israel\u2019s UN ambassador Danny Danon had even said his side was \u201copen to ideas\u201d. But hours after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on an early flight home from the UN - and any lingering hopes of diplomacy prevailing faded away.\n\nThree days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon, marking the start of a ground invasion. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its operations would be \u201climited and targeted\u201d. Fighting so far has driven nearly 1.2 million people from their homes, according to Lebanon\u2019s crisis unit. At least 8 Israeli soldiers have been killed. Israel says the operation is aimed at stopping Hezbollah's ability to launch rockets and drones over the border \u2013 something it has done on an almost daily basis since Hamas, its Palestinian ally, launched a deadly raid into southern Israel almost a year ago, triggering the current Gaza war. Now Israeli troops are fighting a ground war on two fronts simultaneously: Gaza and Lebanon. That hasn\u2019t happened in decades. The last war between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, ended inconclusively with UN Resolution 1701, which stipulated Hezbollah withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon. That never happened, and with Iranian support, Hezbollah grew in strength. Israel has not said that it wants to remove Hezbollah entirely from Lebanon\u2019s political landscape (as it has with Hamas in Gaza), but for all its talk of this being a \u201climited and targeted\u201d operation, it\u2019s clear that Israel is ruthlessly determined to cut Hezbollah down in size. Spurred by an astonishing two and a half weeks, Israel is in an ambitious frame of mind.\n\nThe next day, at around 19:30 local time, 10 million Israelis were sent running for bomb shelters across the country after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The nation's air defence system sprang into action - and allies including the US and UK were involved in repelling the attack - another sign of the broadening scope of the conflict. The IDF said most of the missiles were intercepted, but that a small number struck central and southern Israel. The only person reported to have been killed was a Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank. With its biggest proxy group in disarray, Tehran calculated that to restore some semblance of deterrence it needed to do something more dramatic than its last well-telegraphed missile and drone attack on Israel in April. Hence the larger number of ballistic missiles and the lack of advance notice. But while the attack was more than purely demonstrative, it did not appear to signal Iran\u2019s desire for an all-out fight. That\u2019s hardly surprising. If it came to a full-on war, Iran knows that it would lose, and badly. It could even herald the end of the Islamic Republic. Israel, with powerful western allies - and a smattering of Middle Eastern neighbours willing to help shoot down Iranian missiles - is a regional superpower. Iran, economically fragile and led by an unpopular government, is no match. Nor does it have the sort of allies that would be willing to spring to its defence in the event of a confrontation. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, made suitably defiant noises at Friday prayers in Tehran, but Iran knows it cannot afford to escalate much further.\n\nDespite Hezbollah\u2019s devastating losses, it has vowed to fight on in Lebanon. And history shows us it is easy for Israel to enter Lebanon, but difficult for them to leave. As for Israel\u2019s response to Iran, the region - and the world - has been on tenterhooks since Tuesday. US president Joe Biden said he has discouraged Israel from striking Iranian nuclear or oil facilities as part of its retaliation. A severe reaction seems inevitable, though, and some of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s recent rhetoric suggests that he might be thinking, ultimately, of regime change in Iran. But Israel\u2019s immediate objectives are closer to home. \u201cTotal victory\u201d in Gaza and removing the threat posed by Hezbollah along the northern border. Israeli leaders point out that they at war on many fronts. Benjamin Netanyahu says there are seven: Gaza, Lebanon, the West Bank, Yemen, Iran, Iraq and Syria. It\u2019s true that over the past year, attacks have come from all these directions, even though pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria have so far posed little real threat. We\u2019re not seeing an all-out regional war just yet, but with so many players feeling they have a stake in it, the war in Gaza has metastasised in a dramatic fashion.",
    "UK-India trade talks to re-launch in the new year\n\nFree trade talks between India and the UK will be relaunched in the new year, Downing Street has announced. The news comes after Sir Keir Starmer met Indian prime minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil. A post-Brexit deal could unlock valuable markets for British cars, Scottish whisky, and financial services worth billions of pounds, with India on course to become the third largest economy in the world by 2050. However, the UK has been locked in more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, with key sticking points around relaxing visa rules and lowering fees for Indian students and professionals going to the UK.\n\nUK exports to India are worth \u00a316.6 billion and the trading relationship with India was worth \u00a342 billion in the 12 months before June 2024. Sir Keir has been meeting world leaders over the two-day summit of the 20 biggest global economies, and is expected to unveil new trade and industrial strategies in the coming weeks. He said the latest round of talks with India will focus on security, education, technology, and climate change. \"Boosting economic growth is key to improving living standards for working people,\" he said. \"A new trade deal with India will support jobs and prosperity in the UK \u2013 and represent a step forward in our mission to deliver growth and opportunity across our country.\" Business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds described India as a \"vital trading partner\" and said he believed there is \"a good deal to be done here\" for both sides. \"Whether it's lowering Indian tariffs to help British firms export to this dynamic market or boosting investment which already supports over 600,000 jobs across both countries, striking a deal is important to deliver this Government's core mission of driving economic growth,\" he said. The Labour government has been negotiating with Switzerland, South Korea and the Gulf Cooperation Council since their election victory in July. The UK will also join trade talks for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in mid-December.",
    "Alan Jones was a staple of Australian airwaves for decades\n\nVeteran Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been charged with sexually abusing seven men and a 17-year-old boy. The 83-year-old was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment early on Monday morning, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Mr Jones is one of Australia\u2019s most influential media figures, and has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. He now faces 24 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault.\n\nAll the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio titan personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters. \"I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. [They] have now got the ability to have a voice. This is what they've been asking for,\" he said. Commissioner Karen Webb earlier said police had conducted a \"very complex\", \"protracted\" and \"thorough\" investigation, and expected other alleged victims may now come forward. \"There's no such thing as a matter that's too old to be investigated,\" she said at a press conference. \"You will be listened to, and we will take your matter seriously.\" Mr Jones has been granted conditional bail, and will face court on 18 December. A former teacher, Mr Jones coached Australia's national rugby union team between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had \"died of shame\", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should \"shove a sock\" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern. Mr Jones has also been successfully sued for defamation many times.",
    "'Three or four games in one' as Ireland 'win ugly'\n\nFarrell appeared relieved as Ireland held off a spirited Argentina in a gripping contest\n\nIreland head coach Andy Farrell said his side held their nerve and \"just about got there\" after they came through a chaotic Autumn Nations Series match against Argentina with a nail-biting 22-19 win. Clearly driven after their 19-game home unbeaten run was ended by New Zealand, Ireland raced into a 12-0 lead and held a 13-point advantage at half-time. But Ireland struggled against a resurgent Argentina in the second half and were held scoreless, with the Pumas falling just short of a historic first win on Irish soil. \"It was three or four games in one, wasn't it?\" said Farrell. \"Obviously, the overriding feeling is we're delighted to get the win. There's a few things that we needed to learn from last week and some things that we didn't address on the field. \"We said last week we had a chance of winning ugly. We did that this week, so that's a plus.\"\n\nLike in the New Zealand game last week, Ireland conceded 13 penalties - while Finlay Bealham and Joe McCarthy were yellow-carded - and were guilty of letting Argentina back into the game during the second half. When asked about the side's lack of discipline at times, Farrell said: \"It's not done out of a place of going out there to be ill-disciplined. It's coming from the right place, that might sound stupid but all they're trying to do is the right thing by their team and trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat too much at times. \"We need to be a little bit more patient at times, individually, and trust the team of what we're about.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'We had a chance to win ugly, and we did' - Farrell on Argentina win\n\nEarlier this week, Farrell suggested some of his players were \"lucky enough\" to retain their place in the starting line-up after a flat performance against the All Blacks. But the Englishman said he only received the response he wanted \"in parts\" against an impressive Pumas side. \"I think if I can try and sum it up of where we're at, when you're looking at two top sides that we've played in the first two weeks, it looks like we're still trying to find our feet in the intensity of the full 80 minutes for that top 1% games. \"New Zealand and Argentina have been playing those games for the past five or six months. \"It looks like our lads, some of them, are a little bit shy of that intensity. Hopefully we're building through this month and we'll see the best of us in the next few games.\"",

    "David Warner played 383 matches for Australia across all three formats\n\nFormer Australia opener David Warner says he is available to come out of Test retirement to play in the upcoming series against India. Steve Smith has opened alongside Usman Khawaja in the four Tests Australia have played since Warner, 37, retired in January. However, Smith will move back to number four for the series against India, starting in November, because all-rounder Cameron Green is out with a back injury, meaning Australia have to find another partner for Khawaja. \"I'm always available, just got to pick up the phone,\" Warner told Code Sports. \"I'm always dead serious.\" Warner said he has messaged both Australia coach Andrew McDonald and chief selector George Bailey about returning. However, he said McDonald replied saying \"you retired\". Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris, Sam Konstas and Matthew Renshaw are the most likely candidates to partner Khawaja, with no indication Australia are considering a recall for Warner. Australia host India in five Tests from November to January, with the tourists looking to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nWarner scored 8,786 runs at an average of 44.59 in 112 Tests, with 26 centuries, his final match coming in victory over Pakistan at his home Sydney Cricket Ground. The left-hander also retired from one-day internationals in the lead-up to his final Test, and from T20 internationals following Australia's exit from the T20 World Cup in June. Warner is continuing to play T20 franchise cricket and has signed a two-year deal to represent Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. He has not played in the Sheffield Shield, Australia's domestic red-ball competition, since 2021, but said he would be \"more than happy\" to play in the next round of fixtures if he was \"really needed\" for the India series. He added: \"I did retire for the right reasons to finish the game, and I wanted to finish. But my hand is up if they desperately need someone. I'm not going to shy away from that.\" Smith struggled in his four Tests as opener, scoring 171 runs at an average of 28.50, with Green's absence after spinal surgery allowing the former captain to move back to his preferred spot at number four. Bancroft, Harris and Renshaw have all struggled in their limited Test careers, though Bancroft, who has not played for Australia since the 2019 Ashes, has been in fine form in the Sheffield Shield over the past two years. New South Wales opener Konstas, 19, has only played five first-class matches, but hit centuries in both innings in the opening round of this year's Shield.",
    "Premier League to 'take time' over response to APT case\n\nBoth Manchester City and the Premier League claimed victory after Monday's legal ruling by an arbitration panel\n\nThe Premier League has warned its clubs it will be \"taking the necessary time\" to decide how to respond to this week's landmark verdict in the legal battle with Manchester City over rules governing commercial deals. In a letter sent by chief executive Richard Masters - and seen by BBC Sport - he hints at a possible delay to a key meeting to discuss the situation, advising there could be an \"impact on the scheduling\". Both sides claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel was published on Monday following a legal challenge by City against the league's associated party transaction (APT) regulations. APT rules are in place to ensure sponsorship deals with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value. City had some complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. The tribunal said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of APT rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law. In its initial response on Monday, the Premier League said the panel \"endorsed the overall objectives, framework and decision-making of the APT system\", adding it would seek to amend its rules \"quickly and effectively\". Its Financial Controls Advisory Group and Legal Advisory Group are due to meet next Tuesday, with a full meeting of the clubs following on Thursday.\n\nHowever, in his latest correspondence to clubs, Masters says: \"There have been many club conversations over recent days, with constructive and informative feedback provided. \"We now have a comprehensive set of information and data which is helping to inform our recommended approach and rule amendment drafting. \"We are taking the necessary time to develop our proposals and the associated draft rule amendments for club consideration. \"We will circulate these to clubs when fully considered and ready, which may impact on the scheduling of our planned meetings with Financial Controls and Legal Advisory Groups, and all clubs next week.\" Earlier this week, City claimed the Premier League\u2018s summary of the panel\u2019s ruling was \"misleading\" and contained \"several inaccuracies\", in an escalation of the dispute. In a letter sent to top-flight clubs and the Premier League, City wrote that the rules were now \"void\", that the club had \"concern [over] the Premier League's suggestion that new APT rules should be passed within the next 10 days\", and signalled possible further legal action if there was a \"knee-jerk reaction\". Clubs approached by the BBC have expressed different views over the situation. One referred to \"general concern at the potential destabilising effect of this ongoing dispute\". Another said: \"We want to move forward\u2026 there will obviously be modifications to the rules and it needs to be done in a thoughtful way and we go on. We want to focus on the football.\" Several others declined to comment. The league has also written to the tribunal panel to get further clarity on the status of the APT regulations. This case is not directly related to the Premier League disciplinary commission, which will hear 115 charges against City for allegedly breaching its financial regulations, some of which date back to 2009. City deny wrongdoing.",
    "A party in power for 58 years pledges change for Botswana\n\nBotswana\u2019s governing party - in power for almost six decades - is trying to pull off a trick in Wednesday\u2019s general election by using a phrase normally associated with long-suffering opposition groups. In its manifesto, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is calling for \u201cchange\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s change together and build prosperity for all,\u201d President Mokgweetsi Masisi - in charge of the country since 2018 \u2013 writes in the introduction. It is an acknowledgement that things need to be done differently - the opposition argues that the president\u2019s party is not in a position to do that. Though analysts say the outcome of the election is hard to predict this time, the BDP has won handsome parliamentary majorities at the 11 elections since independence in 1966. It subsequently secured the presidency every time as MPs elect the head of state. The BDP has been credited with overseeing a peaceful and dramatic transformation of a poor country, with only a few kilometres of tarred roads at independence, into a place where average living standards are among the highest on the continent. Underpinning this transformation has been Botswana\u2019s huge diamond reserves - measured by their value, the country is the world\u2019s largest producer of the gemstone. Botswana is facing big economic challenges - hence Masisi's talk of change. More than one in four of the working population is unemployed, with an even higher proportion among younger people, according to the World Bank. Politics professor at the University of Botswana Zibani Maundeni described it as a \u201cjobless economy\u201d. \u201cWe are producing graduates every year and the economy is not producing enough jobs for them,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Africa Daily podcast.\n\nThe Botswana Congress Party is using the slogan \"Save Botswana\u201d to rally support\n\nIn addition, Botswana\u2019s wealth is not evenly spread around among its 2.3 million people. By a measure known as the Gini index, researchers say it is one of the most unequal countries in the world, external. And the diamond industry appears to be under pressure globally as demand has been falling. But Masisi and his party continue to project confidence. At a campaign rally in an opposition stronghold in central Botswana, the president arrived in style in an electric vehicle assembled in the country. Getting out, the 63-year-old former teacher danced towards the stage greeting supporters in red-and-white party colours. Laughter rang through the crowd as Masisi\u2019s humour and charisma electrified the audience. The area - home to the previous President, Ian Khama - elected three opposition MPs in 2019. This was after Khama defected from the BDP to help form the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), saying he regretted picking Masisi as his successor. The dramatic fall-out between the two men led to Khama leaving the country, accusing the government of trying to poison him. Khama was then charged with money laundering, among other crimes, all of which he denies.\n\nEx-President Ian Khama (R) has fallen out with his successor\n\nIt also ended the political dominance of his family - his father, Sir Seretse Khama, was the country's first president and served for 14 years from 1966. \u201cI am sorry, please come back home and also call others over,\u201d Masisi told the rally pleading to voters to return to the BDP. \u201cMasisi truly understands our challenges and brought better programmes to fund our businesses,\u201d she told the BBC, her eyes shining with conviction. \u201cHis policies have helped us grow as you can see we no longer import vegetables. I believe in his vision for our future,\u201d said the small-business owner.\n\u2022 None How friends became foes in Africa's diamond state\n\nBut according to an opinion poll, many others may not be so easy to convince. It said that despite the country ranking highly in good governance on the continent, people in Botswana had a negative view of the government believing there were high levels of corruption. \u201cStrong majorities express little or no trust in the incumbent and disapprove of the way he has performed his job,\u201d it said. BDP spokesperson Kagelelo Banks Kentse questioned the credibility of the poll. He argued that Afrobarometer had in previous elections underestimated support for the BDP and thought it would be no different this time. Though the party is not taking anything for granted. \u201cI would be very wrong to say that we are over-confident,\u201d Kentse told the BBC. \u201cI always hear people saying: \u2018This is the toughest election we\u2019ve come across\u2019, but we say that in every election year. You never win before the actual vote.\u201d He admitted that the unemployment rate did not paint a good picture, but argued that every nation on the continent was experiencing similar problems, adding that his party was pledging to create 300,000 more jobs. Kentse also touted the toughly negotiated deal that Masisi struck with diamond firm De Beers last year for Botswana to benefit more from its natural resources. Initially the state will get a 30% share of the rough diamonds mined in the country, an increase on the 25% it got previously, rising to 50% within 10 years. But Dumelang Saleshando, leader of one of the largest opposition parties, argued that the government has just copied others\u2019 ideas. He said his Botswana Congress Party (BCP) had first set a jobs target, which the BDP had previously rejected saying it was better to leave things to the free market. One of the slogans Saleshando is deploying is: \u201cSave Botswana\u201d. \u201cI think people have seen the BDP for what it is,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt certainly cannot argue that it is an agent of change. In the past it has always tried to say it\u2019s about keeping stability - more of the same - and out of panic they are trying to preach what they don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nUDC leader Duma Boko (R in blue tie) has alleged that there have been attempts to rig the election\n\nSupporters of another opposition party - the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), which got the second largest share of the vote in 2019, came out in their numbers in the north of the capital, Gaborone. Dressed in blue-and-white T-shirts and sun hats, they cheered leader Duma Boko. Unlike Masisi, Boko generally remained serious, in order to emphasise how much the people were suffering under the BDP. He alleged that there were attempts to rig the poll. \u201cI urge you all to be vigilant and after voting out the BDP you remain at the polling station to guard your vote,\u201d he said. Thapelo Dimpe, a 45-year-old former teacher, has no doubts about why he wants to see the president's party defeated. \u201cMasisi has let us down on education reform. The UDC plans to invest in our schools and empower our youth with the education they deserve,\u201d he said. Although the government has a host of problems that could dent its support, opposition divisions could enable the BDP to stay in power. Every MP is elected on a first-past-the-post basis, meaning that to win a seat, the BDP only needs the largest number of votes in a constituency rather than more than 50%. In a seat where the UDC, BCP or BPF \u2013 or a number of other parties \u2013 are running, it could mean that the opposition vote is split, allowing the BDP to get in. \u201cThese parties seem to have factionalism within themselves, they keep taking internal issues to the media \u2013 they are not really united,\u201d political analyst Lesole Machacha told the BBC. But he also pointed out that the BDP had its own problems. \u201cThe ruling party is not 100% intact \u2013 it is also having issues. In some constituencies BDP politicians who were not happy with the primary process are running as independent candidates, which could divide that vote,\u201d Mr Machacha said. All this makes for a closely fought and unpredictable election, he added. For one of Africa\u2019s most successful political parties, the question now is whether enough people are convinced that it can oversee the change that the country needs.",
    "Soldiers returning from the war have claimed at least 242 lives, reports say\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a veteran of the special military operation, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d were the words Irina heard as she was attacked by a man in Artyom, in Russia\u2019s far east. She had been returning from a night out when the man kicked her and beat her with his crutch. The force of the strike was so strong that it broke the crutch. When the police arrived, the man showed them a document proving he had been in Ukraine and claimed that because of his service \u201cnothing will happen to him\u201d. The attack on Irina is just one of many reported to have been committed by soldiers returning from Ukraine. Verstka, an independent Russian website, estimates that at least 242 Russians have been killed by soldiers returning from Ukraine. Another 227 have been seriously injured. Like the man who beat Irina, many of the attackers have previous criminal convictions and were released from prison specifically to join Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The BBC estimates that the Wagner mercenary group recruited more than 48,000 prisoners to fight in Ukraine. When Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash last year, Russia\u2019s defence ministry took over recruitment in prisons. These cases have severely impacted Russian society, says sociologist Igor Eidman. \"This is a very serious problem, and it can potentially get worse. All the traditional ideas of good and evil are being turned upside down,\" he told the BBC. \"People who have committed heinous crimes - murderers, rapists, cannibals and paedophiles - they not only avoid punishment by going to war, the unprecedented bit is that they are being hailed as heroes.\"\n\nThere are numerous reasons why Russian soldiers lucky enough to return from the war would think they are above the law. Official media call them \"heroes,\" and President Vladimir Putin has dubbed them Russia's new \"elite\". Those recruited into the army from prisons either had their convictions removed or they were pardoned.\n\nParticipants in Russia's war in Ukraine are hailed as heroes by pro-Kremlin media\n\nIt is not unheard of for released convicts return from the war in Ukraine, reoffend and then escape punishment for a second time by going back to the front. This makes some police officers despair. \u201cFour years ago, I put him away for seven years,\u201d policeman Grigory told the Novaya Gazeta website. \"And here he is in front of me again, saying: 'You won't be able to do anything, officer. Now's our time, the time of those who are shedding blood in the special military operation.'\" Russian courts have routinely used participation in the war against Ukraine as a reason to issue milder sentences. But many cases don\u2019t even reach court. Moscow has introduced a new law against \u201cdiscrediting the Russian armed forces,\u201d which has made some victims of crimes by veterans afraid to report them. Olga Romanova, the head of prisoner rights NGO Russia Behind Bars, says a sense of impunity is driving up crime rates. \"The main consequence is the gap between crime and punishment in the public mind. If you commit a crime, it is far from certain that you are going to be punished,\" she tells the BBC. In 2023, the number of serious crimes registered in Russia rose by almost 10%, and in the first half of this year the number of military personnel convicted of crimes more than doubled compared to the same period a year before. Sociologist Anna Kuleshova argues that violence is becoming more acceptable in Russian society, especially because criminals can now escape punishment by going to war. \"There is a tendency to legalise violence. The idea that violence is a kind of norm will probably spread - violence at school, domestic violence, violence in relationships and as a way to resolve conflicts. \"This is facilitated by the militarisation of society, the turn to conservatism and the romanticisation of war. Violent crimes committed within the country are being atoned by the violence of war.\" Igor Eidman, Olga Romanova and Anna Kuleshova all spoke to the BBC from outside Russia.",

    "China on Monday launched new military drills off the coast of Taiwan in what it described as \"punishment\" for a speech given by its president William Lai, when he vowed to \"resist annexation\" or \"encroachment upon our sovereignty\". China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and its president Xi Jinping has vowed to retake it by force if necessary. Taiwan said it detected 34 naval vessels and 125 aircraft in formation around the island on Monday. Maps published by Chinese state media indicated its forces were positioned around the whole island. It said later that the drills had been successfully concluded.\n\nThe Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the drills involved all wings of the army and were designed to simulate attacking Taiwan by land, sea and air. Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command said the drills \"fully tested the integrated joint operation capabilities\" of its troops. An earlier statement from the Taiwanese defence ministry condemned the Chinese move and said its priority was to avoid direct clashes which could escalate the stand-off further. Outlying islands were put on high alert, it added. China's foreign ministry confirmed it had simulated military assaults and port blockades, and described Taiwanese independence as being \"incompatible\" with peace in the region. A post by the Chinese coast guard on its Weibo account later depicted the route of the patrol in the shape of a heart.\n\nChina has held several major military drills off the coast of Taiwan since 2022 and its fighter jets regularly enter Taiwanese airspace. The latest exercise has been dubbed Joint Sword 2024-B by Beijing and had been widely expected since May, when drills bearing the same name and officially labelled as part A were staged. That exercise, which China described as its largest yet, were timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Lai, who Beijing has long seen as a \"troublemaker\" advocating for Taiwan's independence. His latest comments, made on Taiwan's national day, were condemned by China, which said he was escalating tensions with \"sinister intentions\". But while these drills were widely expected, the deployment and how close Chinese ships and aircraft were to Taiwan - as well as the fiery rhetoric - could be seen as very aggressive behaviour. In any other context, it would have been seen as a dramatic escalation - but it came against the backdrop of tensions that were already very high. The US reacted by saying that there was no justification for the drills after Lai's \"routine\" speech, and that China should avoid further actions which may jeopardise peace and stability in the region.\n\nThe recent history of China\u2019s military intimidation of Taiwan goes back to 1996, after Taiwan held its first direct presidential elections. China declared several areas around Taiwan off limits, and fired short-range ballistic missiles into those areas off the north and south coasts. US President Bill Clinton quietly moved US Navy forces into the Taiwan strait to demonstrate to Beijing that the US would prevent an attack on the island. Tensions eased considerably between 2008 and 2016 - until the leader of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen was elected as president. China considers the DPP to be a hard line pro-independence party, and responded by cutting off all direct contacts with the government in Taipei. That situation has remained ever since. In August 2022 US house speaker Nancy Pelosi flew into Taipei \u2013 the first time a sitting house speaker had visited the island since 1997. Pelosi\u2019s visit and her open support for Taiwan was seen by Beijing as a huge provocation \u2013 coming close to a formal recognition of the government here by a very senior US politician. It reacted with fury \u2013 holding two days of exercises and for the first time ever flying ballistic missiles over the island and in to the Pacific Ocean.",
    "The climate-damaging vapours left behind by jet planes could be easily tackled, aviation experts say, with a new study suggesting they could be eliminated for a few pounds per flight. Jet condensation trails, or contrails, have spawned wild conspiracy theories alleging mind control and the spreading of disease, but scientists say the real problem is their warming effect. Researchers argue these icy trails essentially double the amount of heating that\u2019s caused by aviation's use of fossil fuels. The problem will be discussed at the UN climate conference, COP29, in Baku for the first time.\n\nContrails form in the sky in the same way that your breath goes misty on a chilly morning. When a plane passes through cold humid air, the contrails form as the vapour from the engines condenses on unburned fuel fragments in the exhaust stream. While the causes of contrails have been known about for decades, it\u2019s only in recent years that the climate warming impact of these human generated clouds has been recognised. \u201cThey create an artificial layer of clouds, which traps the heat from the Earth that\u2019s trying to escape to outer space,\u201d said Carlos Lopez de la Osa, from the Transport & Environment campaign group, which has carried out a new study on the solutions to contrails. \u201cThe scale of the warming that's associated with them is roughly having a similar impact to that of aviation carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theories have grown up around contrails, with some people alleging they are in fact \u201cchemtrails\u201d that contain chemical or biological substances. The aim of these chemtrails is either vaccinating the population, spreading pandemics or controlling the minds of the masses, the conspiracy theories go on to claim. All of these ideas are completely untrue. \u201cIt is unfortunate that these conspiracy theories are muddying the water on an issue where we need a lot of consensus, a lot of clarity,\u201d said Matteo Mirolo, from Breakthrough Energy, and one of the organisers of the COP29 discussion about the contrails. \u201cChemtrails are an unfounded theory. There's simply no scientific backing.\u201d\n\nThe COP event, external aims to draw attention to the fact that relatively simple changes to aviation practice could eliminate much of the warming impact of these trails. According to the Transport & Environment study, some 80% of the warming associated with contrails is generated by just 3% of flights. Tweaking the flight paths of a handful of aircraft could reduce contrail warming by more than half by 2040, at a cost of less than \u00a34 per flight. Geography and a flight's latitude have a strong influence on whether a contrail is warming. Flights over North America, Europe and the North Atlantic region accounted for more than half of global contrail warming in 2019, the report said. Time of day also influences the climate effects of contrails. Those formed by evening and night flights have the largest warming contribution. Seasonality is also important - the most warming contrails tend to occur in winter. \u201cPlanes are already flying around thunderstorms and turbulence areas,\u201d Mr Lopez de la Osa said. \u201cWe will need to add one more constraint to flight planning, which is avoiding areas of contrail formation.\u201d \u201cOf the climate solutions which are being discussed at COP29, it's arguably one of the simplest ones.\u201d The researchers are hoping that by holding this event at COP they will spread awareness of the problem and the solutions. They point to the huge amounts of money and research going into developing sustainable aviation fuels. They believe that tackling contrails could achieve a major win for the climate, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "251 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October\n\nPlaid Cymru's call to boycott Israel at its party conference has been criticised by a Welsh Jewish group. The South Wales Jewish Representative Council (SWJRC) said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision and pointed out the date coincided with Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Laurence Kahn, chair of the SWJRC, accused Plaid Cymru of lending justification to the 7 October attacks which were carried out by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group based in Gaza. Plaid Cymru said it had been \"resolute and unequivocal in condemning the horrific attacks carried out by Hamas on 7 October\".\n\nA motion backed at Plaid's conference by the party's four MPs and passed by party members described Israel as an \"apartheid state\" and accused it of \"ethnic cleansing and war crimes\". The conference heard from the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, Husam Zomlot, who called for Wales to pressure the UK government over Gaza. About 1,200 people - mostly Israeli civilians - were killed in the Hamas 7 October attacks just over one year ago. Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK, also took 251 hostages, of which 97 remain unaccounted for. Some 42,000 people have been killed as part of Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The vote on the motion was held on the second day of the conference, which was a Saturday and was when Yom Kippur was taking place.\n\nHusam Zomlot spoke at Plaid Cymru's conference in Cardiff last weekend.\n\nThe SWJRC said in a statement: \"We are deeply disturbed by Plaid Cymru\u2019s decision to call for a boycott of Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar\". Describing the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October as the \"worst atrocities committed against Jews since the Holocaust\", the council accused Plaid of lending \"justification to these heinous acts of terror\". \"Despite Plaid Cymru\u2019s accusations of genocide, it was Hamas - not Israel - that deliberately targeted civilians on and after 7 October. This false equivalency is not only unjust but dangerously misleading.\" The council accused Plaid of \"pandering to extreme positions that not only alienate the Jewish community but also undermine the pursuit of genuine peace\". A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said in response: \u201cWe have also been clear that the response of the Israeli state has been disproportionate and unjustified, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza. We have consistently argued that international law must be upheld without fear or favour.\" The spokesperson added: \u201cAs a party with a long and proud tradition of promoting peace, we are appalled at the suggestion that we encourage violence in any form and are deeply disappointed by this accusation. \"Plaid Cymru, as it always has done, will continue to make the case for an immediate ceasefire, a release of all hostages without delay, for halting arms sales, an end to hostilities by all parties, and for the intensification of diplomatic efforts to seek a stable and lasting peace for all the people of Israel and Palestine and the wider region.\"",

At least five people have died in the storm that struck much of the UK over the weekend and prompted criticism about a lack of preparation and insufficient warnings. The severe flood warning for the River Nene in Northamptonshire remains in force with a \"danger to life and risk of significant disruption\", as a holiday park has been submerged for the third time this year. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said more flooding was likely this week but it should be \"less severe\" than on Sunday.\n\nAt least 300 properties have been flooded across the UK. Residents of flood-hit areas are being left with major clean-up jobs, with one business owner telling the BBC her store had been devastated. \"Everything's been wiped out this time,\" said Laura Jones, whose crafts shop in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, was hit. \"Business is totally finished, flooding has wiped us out one too many times.\" Politicians and residents in south Wales, one of the areas worst hit by the flooding, have criticised what they say is a lack of preparation and insufficient warning from officials. In Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, locals said lessons had not been learnt from Storm Dennis, which left much of the town under water in 2020. One resident, Paula, said authorities \"promised us the world, and delivered absolutely nothing\". Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said he was \"amazed\" that only a yellow weather warning was put in place. The Met Office said it would conduct a full assessment of the \"forecast and warning system\" for Storm Bert as it does for any named storm. It added the storm was \"well forecast\" in advance with a number of warnings issued ahead of its arrival. Natural Resources Wales said the government body would \"absolutely\" look into complaints about a lack of preparedness. Heledd Fychan, Plaid Cymru Senedd member for South Wales Central, said the warnings came too late: \"It's just by luck that it wasn't worse than this.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Six flood warnings remain in place in Wales with some residents in south-east Wales being advised to boil their water , externalbefore using it to avoid contamination. Scotland has been less affected by floods, with five warnings and alerts in place. But Storm Bert is now tracking eastwards across Scotland, bringing heavy showers and strong winds. The Highlands had the last remaining weather warning for the storm. In Northampton, the only area still covered by a severe flood warning, police have warned against all unnecessary travel. The local fire and rescue service said it was working to evacuate the Billing Aquadrome holiday park, with around 1,000 affected. This is the third time this year the park has flooded. A 94-year-old woman told the BBC she was able to escape the rising water in her home on Saturday using her stair lift in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. And, in West Yorkshire a father pulled his baby from the window of his car and carried him above his head after the vehicle entered deep flood water.\n\nPeople used buckets to bail out water from a submerged street in Pontypridd, Wales\n\nThis was the scene in a flooded street in Cwmtillery, south Wales, where a combination of mud forced people from their homes\n\nSome train operators cancelled services on Monday due to flooded lines. Great Western Railway, which runs trains between London and south-west England, advised passengers not to travel on any of its routes. West Midlands Railway warned of severe disruption to some of its routes after flooding in Northamptonshire. National Rail has warned of disruption across England, Wales and Scotland and advised customers to check their routes, external before travelling. Many roads around the UK have been closed in flood-hit areas.\n\nSevere flooding has also prompted school closures, with more than 40 closed across Wales, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire on Monday morning. Some 57 children were rescued from a school bus near Evesham, Worcestershire, when it became stuck in a flooded ditch. Students were ferried to dry land in a fire service rescue boat.\n\nIn Wiltshire, Chippenham town centre was brought to a standstill after the River Avon burst its banks. Becky Lyons runs a pet shop in the town and said her premises was left under several feet of water: \"I feel a bit empty and numb. I've put everything into this shop.\" Ben Ruddy, whose fish and chip shop was flooded in Lydney, Gloucestershire, said: \"The sandbags did not do a lot. Within a couple of hours the water was over them.\" In Worcestershire, police are investigating footage of a tractor being driven through flooded streets which caused bow waves to hit shop windows. Louise Preston, who owns a pottery shop in Tenbury Wells, said her store's front window was smashed by the water as the tractor drove past.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFive men died over the weekend as a result of the adverse weather.

    "There have been numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts among migrants\n\nMigrants stranded for years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia will be offered the right to come to the UK, under a government proposal. Around 60 Sri Lankan Tamils have spent more than three years in a makeshift camp on the island, which hosts a secretive UK-US military base, after becoming the first people ever to file asylum claims there. The government has previously opposed bringing the group to the UK and complex legal battles have been fought for years over their fate. In a letter on Monday, government lawyers said that \u201cfollowing further consideration\u201d, the government had proposed a \u201cchange of policy\u201d.\n\u2022 None Full story: The tropical island 'hell' for dozens of stranded migrants\n\nUnder this, \u201call families, children and those of the unaccompanied males who do not have criminal convictions, outstanding charges or investigations would be offered the opportunity to be transferred directly to the UK\u201d. It added that work on the offer was \u201congoing\u201d and a formal decision would be made within 48 hours. \u201cDetails will be provided as soon as possible,\u201d it said. In a phone call with one of the Tamils, an official said the decision to bring them to the UK was due to the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d of the island, adding that entry would be for \u201ca short period of time\u201d. The Prime Minister\u2019s Official Spokesperson told reporters at a daily news briefing in Downing Street that \u201cthe government inherited a deeply-troubling situation that remained unresolved under the previous administration when it came to migrants who had arrived at Diego Garcia. Diego Garcia had clearly never been a suitable long-term location for migrants\u201d. He added \u201cthe government has been working to find a solution that protects their welfare and the integrity of British territorial borders\u201d. Lawyers representing the Tamils described the move as a \u201cvery welcome step\u201d in a \u201clong battle for justice\u201d. \u201cAfter three years living in inhumane conditions, having to fight various injustices in court on numerous occasions, His Majesty\u2019s Government [HMG] has now decided that our clients should now come directly to the UK. We hope that HMG will now take urgent steps to give effect to this decision,\u201d Simon Robinson of UK law firm Duncan Lewis told the BBC. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is an enormous relief to our clients and we urge the home secretary to close the camp and bring our clients here without any further delay,\" said Leigh Day lawyer Tom Short. \u201cIt looks like a dream. I don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d one Tamil said after receiving a call from an official with the news.\n\nThe UK had previously offered some of the group a temporary move to Romania with the possibility of then coming to the UK. Others were offered financial incentives to return to Sri Lanka. The latest development comes after the UK announced last month that it was handing sovereignty of British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot), which includes Diego Garcia, to Mauritius. The military base, however, will remain on the island. Under a separate deal last month, future migrants arriving on Biot before the arrangement with Mauritius comes into force will be transferred to the island of St Helena - another UK territory some 5,000 miles away. In court on Monday, lawyers said three people with criminal convictions may be sent to the island of Montserrat - a British territory in the Caribbean - to serve their sentences. The BBC was recently granted unprecedented access to Diego Garcia to attend a court hearing, which is set to determine whether the Tamils had been unlawfully detained. During the visit, the migrants walked the court through military tents they have been living in, pointing out damp, tears in the canvas, droppings, and a rats\u2019 nest above one of the beds. Over the past three years, there have been multiple hunger strikes on the island, and numerous incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts after which some people have been transferred to Rwanda for medical care. \u201cFor three years I have been caged. Now they are releasing me but I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel a bit blank,\u201d one man in Rwanda said. \u201cI am very happy because I am coming to the UK. I thought they would send me to some other country.\u201d The group includes 16 children. Most are awaiting final decisions on claims for international protection - which the United Nations says is akin to refugee status - or appealing against rejections. In total, eight have been granted international protection.",
    "They\u2019re all over your TikTok and Instagram \u2013 people unboxing the latest extravagant beauty advent calendar. Influencers excitedly wonder what eyeliner, serum or hand cream will be behind door one, and gush over the beautiful box it has come in. But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money? Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester. We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog. \"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\" That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items. \"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"\n\nCissy Jones says there is massive interest in beauty advent calendars online\n\nRetailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say. And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards. \"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail. However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".\n\nThe size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two. But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.\n\nAdvent calendars are a great way of trying products she's seen on social media, says Holly May Arnott, who has started posting unboxing videos on TikTok herself\n\nHolly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says. The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together. \"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December. The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\". But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\". With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar. However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.\n\nNihal doesn't think it is worth paying hundreds of pounds for a calendar unless you're going to use every product in it\n\nAs a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item. Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price. \"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma. \"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\" But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg. And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.\n\nMany beauty calendars are already sold out, such as these from Sephora and Harrods\n\nThe likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already. The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000. But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one. \"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson. It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items. This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more. Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount. Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year. Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there. \"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\" With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar. But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case. \"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\"",
    "Actors Danielle Deadwyler and John David Washington attended the movie's UK premiere at the London Film Festival\n\nThe Piano Lesson has become the latest August Wilson play to be adapted for the screen by Denzel Washington and his family. But while the Hollywood star has directed, starred in or produced film adaptations such as Fences and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom in recent years, it's his two sons who are taking centre stage for the latest screen adaptation. The Piano Lesson is directed by filmmaker Malcolm Washington, while his actor brother John David Washington plays one of the leading roles. Their father Denzel serves as producer. Speaking ahead of the its UK premiere at the London Film Festival, John David Washington described the film's team as \"fearless\" in their efforts to produce a unique interpretation of the 1987 play.\n\nMalcolm and John David Washington's two sisters are also involved in The Piano Lesson - Katia Washington is an executive producer, while Olivia Washington, who recently starred opposite Kit Harington in the West End show Slave Play, has an acting role. Speaking at the Telluride Film Festival last month, actress and Denzel's wife Pauletta Pearson Washington acknowledged the film was a family affair, joking: \"All my babies are involved in this.\" The movie could also see actress Danielle Deadwyler join the Oscars race, two years after she was widely considered to have been unfairly snubbed following her acclaimed performance in Till. Set in 1936 Pittsburgh in the aftermath of the Great Depression, the Netflix film follows a brother and sister who disagree about what to do with a family heirloom piano they have inherited.\n\nThe film tells the story of siblings who disagree about the fate of a family heirloom piano\n\nDaughter Berniece (Deadwyler) has not played the piano since the siblings' mother died. Instead, it sits in her living room and serves as a reminder of what her ancestors endured as slaves. The faces of earlier generations of the family have been carved into the piano's wood. But while Berniece refuses even to move the piano, her brother Boy Willie (John David Washington) wants to sell it in order to buy land. Speaking at Deadline's Contender's London event,, external John David Washington described the cast and production team's attitude as \"fearless\". \u201cIt was so fearless because, right away, we were like, OK, we\u2019re making our film,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a lot of versions of this story that exist, and this one is ours. \"We\u2019re going to pass it through our filter of honesty and truth and vulnerability, put ourselves on the line, and fine-tune it to the point that, when you get to the end, the spirit of it is still there.\"\n\nThe Piano Lesson marks the directorial debut for Malcolm Washington, who also walked the red carpet in London on Saturday\n\nDeadwyler also praised Malcolm Washington, saying the director \"gave us free rein, particularly during rehearsals, and those ideas and the way that we engaged each other enabled him to craft whatever he did with the camera\". The new adaptation of The Piano Lesson could become part of the coming film awards race. Washington's two other August Wilson adaptations, Fences and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were Oscar nominated in 2017 and 2021 respectively. But while those two movies felt like filmed plays set largely in one location, The Piano Lesson has much more visual variety. Malcolm Washington has made efforts to make it a more cinematic adaptation. Wilson was a US playwright known for chronicling the lives and experiences of black Americans. His other works include Jitney, Two Trains Running and Joe Turner's Come and Gone.\n\nThe film also stars Samuel L Jackson as the siblings' uncle\n\nL-R: Malcolm, Katia and John David Washington pictured at the recent Telluride film festival\n\nThe Piano Lesson was revived on Broadway in 2022, and many of the actors who appeared in it on stage have transferred to the film. However, Till star Deadwyler has joined the cast for the screen adaptation, and many critics have singled out her performance for praise. \"While most of the cast is the same that appeared on Broadway, the movie is undeniably Deadwyler\u2019s show,\" said Variety's Peter Debruge., external The actress \"anchors the film with a performance of tremendous courage and heft\", agreed Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker., external Deadwyler was widely expected to take one of the five best actress slots when that year's Oscar nominations were announced in January 2023. However, a combination of events meant she missed out on a place in the category, such a successful grassroots campaign to score Andrea Riseborough a nomination and Michelle Williams' decision to submit herself as a lead actress instead of supporting. That means The Piano Lesson could be seen by Academy voters as a second chance to recognise Deadwyler's work, potentially placing her in this year's best supporting actress race.\n\nActress Danielle Deadwyler is seen as being overdue some Oscars recognition\n\nAs a whole, the film has received broadly positive review from critics at the festivals it has played so far, although some were more lukewarm in their response. \"It\u2019s clear that Washington takes the task of adapting Wilson quite seriously, and there\u2019s much to admire about The Piano Lesson,\" said the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye., external \"But the duty can also be limiting, and there are times when The Piano Lesson is too faithful, struggling to shake the spectre of the stage.\" \"Malcolm Washington shows himself to be a capable director, expanding this story in the ways he can while staying true to the source material,\" wrote Collider's Ross Bonaime., external The Wrap's Carla Renata said, external the film \"serves as a reminder that generational wealth is not just monetary, but emotionally and genetically tied to our ancestors\". But IndieWire's Caleb Hammond said:, external \"While this version contains its fair share of standout sequences along with Oscar-ready performances, the film never fully coalesces into an effective, singular, emotional narrative.\"\n\nDeadwyler previously starred in Till, while John David Washington is best known for Christopher Nolan's Tenet\n\nThe Piano Lesson marks Malcolm Washington's directorial debut. In an interview with Variety, external last month, his father Denzel said: \"I\u2019m extremely proud of Malcolm. \"From early on, I knew he had a vision. I\u2019ve learned through my son the difference between making a film and being a filmmaker. I\u2019ve directed four films... but I didn\u2019t know what to do necessarily. Malcolm has studied filmmaking. He\u2019s an academic. \"When he was younger, he would read my scripts and ask insightful questions. His mother is a huge film buff, so he - like all my kids - grew up watching movies. He always had a desire to make films, and now he\u2019s doing it.\" While Malcolm has stayed behind the camera, viewers may be more familiar with John David Washington, the actor who played the lead role in Christopher Nolan's Tenet and has also appeared in Amsterdam, BlacKkKlansman and Malcolm & Marie opposite Zendaya.",

Sisters leaving Lebanon: \"We're not sure when we'll be back\"\n\nThree British sisters have spoken of their sadness at being forced to flee their home in Lebanon, saying they had \"no choice\" but to board a flight to the UK. Amal Zahereddine, 18, and her sisters Yasmine, 17, and Layla, 22, were among British nationals preparing to leave on a UK government charter flight from Beirut to Birmingham. \"Right now there is no way we can stay. The noises, the situation, is just getting very traumatising so we have no choice,\" Amal said. Israel has stepped up its aerial assault of Beirut in the past week, targeting densely populated areas in the city's south that it said was home to Hezbollah leaders and military equipment. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told British nationals in Lebanon they \"must leave now\" as fighting continues.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC from the airport in Beirut, university student Amal said she loved Lebanon and was \"very upset\" at having to leave. \"We're just going to stay hopeful that it's not going to be for long and we're going to come back to our precious country.\" Amal, who was born in Surrey and has lived in Lebanon for five years, said she and her sisters planned to reunite with family in West Sussex. Her sister Yasmine, who is still in school, said she would have never imagined leaving, but the situation required it. Another British citizen, Libby, 25, boarded a commercial flight from Beirut to Cairo on Wednesday morning, and described the situation in the Lebanese capital as \"terrifying\". \"You can't sleep because you can hear the Israeli drones over your head, you wake up in the night because you hear strikes,\" she told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependants, in Lebanon. The chartered flight leaving Beirut on Wednesday will only be able to take a fraction of them, raising questions about whether additional flights will be needed.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey was in Cyprus on Wednesday to meet some of the British personnel preparing for the possibility of evacuating UK nationals out of Lebanon. Britons in Lebanon have been advised to register their presence with officials on the government's website. Healey's visit to Cyprus came just hours after Iran carried out a missile attack against Israel on Tuesday night. The defence secretary said British forces had \"played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation\u201d. He gave no further details but the BBC understands British military jets did not shoot down any Iranian ballistic missiles nor did the Royal Navy Destroyer, HMS Duncan, fire any Sea Viper missiles. Iran said the attack was, in part, retaliation for the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of its proxy, Hezbollah, in a strike on Beirut last week.\n\nYou can get in touch via this form.\n\nAre you a British national planning to leave Lebanon?

    "Kate Nash says OnlyFans will earn more than tour\n\nKate Nash is best known for her 2007 hit Foundations\n\nSinger Kate Nash says she thinks she will make more money from selling photos of her bottom on OnlyFans than she will from her concerts, after joining the platform because it's \"a really difficult time for artists to tour\". Under the slogan \"Butts for tour buses\", the musician announced on Thursday that her OnlyFans income will subsidise her shows because \"touring makes losses not profits\". \"I also think it's bit of a punk protest as a woman to take control of my body and sell it to be able to fund my passion project, which is actually my 18-year career,\" she explained. \"I want to highlight that, and I want people to talk about it, and I want people to know the truth about what what's happening in the music business.\"\n\nNash, who has just finished a three-week US tour, started her UK dates in Glasgow on Thursday, and will then move on to Europe. Her date at London's Koko is sold out. \"I'm losing money from those tours,\" she told BBC News. \"The only way I could find to make a profit on the tour - you're either going, hopefully I sell enough T-shirts to cover the debt, or you cut people's wages, or you fire band and crew, or you travel dangerously.\" She wasn't willing to cut corners or the quality of her shows, she said. \"So that leaves me in a position where I'm not profiting from tours. So is this a job, or is it a passion project?\" She also said it was \"an important time for women to take control and to feel empowered\", and that she often posted photos of her posterior anyway. The pictures she's posted on OnlyFans so far are revealing but not explicit. \"I think the arse is the perfect combination of comedy and sexuality,\" she said. \"I actually like bums. I think they're just quite great. I think it's funny. I enjoy taking pictures of my bum. Always been a bit of a flasher. So I'm going to enjoy doing it, and I'm already putting it online anyway. \"I'm going to probably make more money doing that than the music over the next three months.\"\n\nNash, who released her fifth studio album in June, also told fans on Instagram: \"No need to stream my music, I\u2019m good for the 0.003 of a penny per stream thanks.\" Last month, fellow singer Lily Allen revealed she makes more money by selling pictures of her feet on OnlyFans than she does from Spotify streams. Meanwhile, in recent months, acts including Rachel Chinouriri, Ratboy and The Duke Spirit singer Liela Moss have all cancelled tours, blaming the costs. Nash highlighted a survey from recording and rehearsal studio network Pirate, which said most artists have not seen an increase in gig fees in recent years despite a rise in ticket prices. \"Festival prices and ticket prices have gone up drastically, but the musicians' wage hasn't,\" she said. \"So you might be playing a venue that you've played multiple times and you can sell it out, [but] you're getting the same fee that you did 10 years ago, probably. But all the other costs have gone up.\"\n\nLily Allen sells pictures of her feet on OnlyFans\n\nSome corporations make big profits from music, as do a \"select few\" artists, she said. \"But the majority are losing money, and we are also creating an environment where the industry is saying, we don't want diversity in music, because we don't want working class people to be able to afford to do this.\" Musicians could follow a lead from people who earn a living from selling sexual content on sites like OnlyFans, she suggested. \"You've got all this control, and you're deciding what you want to do and how you want to do it, and people want to pay you for it. \"We just haven't taught any of those lessons to anyone with music and art - that art is so valuable and so worthwhile in our lives and so meaningful. We\u2019re totally happy to devalue it. \"Where can we learn from the sex workers? Maybe we can learn something from this industry. How do we get empowered as artists and take a bit more control?\"",

Eight of the wounded were trapped under the truck and others were lying and walking near it,\u201d a medic for Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. Many of the injured were reportedly pensioners on a day trip to a nearby museum. The driver of the truck, named as Rami Natur, an Arab Israeli from the town of Qalansawe in central Israel, was shot dead by a civilian at the scene.\n\nEmergency services were called to the Glilot Junction around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Sunday following reports of a truck ramming. Yechiel Ben Moshe told the Ynet website: \"We were a group of retirees going to Glilot to visit a museum and listen to a lecture.\" \"The bus parked, and people got off. A truck came from behind and I heard a huge noise from the truck. \"It drove toward us to run us over. \"Around me, everyone was injured and bleeding, and others were in shock. It looked like an accident at first, but then shots were fired at the terrorist.\" Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, called for the family of the suspected attacker to be deported from Israel. Israel is already fighting its enemies on multiple fronts in Gaza and Lebanon. But this attack raises a different question: how to keep its people safe from attackers already inside Israel, who use vehicles as weapons.",

    "Lib Dems would vote down Budget that contains indyref cash\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Cole-Hamilton says Lib Dems would vote down budget with indy cash\n\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrat leader has said his party would vote down the Scottish government's upcoming Budget if it contains even a \"penny\" promoting independence. The minority SNP administration needs some opposition MSPs to either back or abstain in the vote on its spending plans to get them passed. Alex Cole-Hamilton confirmed talks had taken place about the price of Lib Dem support - but made it clear they would actively vote against any spending plans that promoted Scottish independence. Finance secretary Shona Robison will deliver the Scottish government's Budget at Holyrood on Wednesday 4 December.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Cole-Hamilton said the public had sent the SNP a \"clear message\" in the recent general election they are \"done with the constitution\". He said: \"I don\u2019t see a circumstance where any Liberal Democrat could vote for a budget that is clearly spending money on the constitution. \"I think that would be a massive misuse of public funds no matter how small. \"We need every penny available spent on our schools, on our GP surgeries, on the mental health crisis.\"\n\nCole-Hamilton added that his party believes in \"moving forward together\". \"The SNP will have to go a long way to persuade us, that whilst they might delete things like any independence spending from their budget that they won\u2019t just go back to their old ways of spending any political oxygen on the constitution,\" he continued. Pressed on whether Lib Dem MSPs might abstain, which would allow the Budget to pass despite containing money promoting independence, he said he would vote it down and \"that is where we would be\".\n\nThe SNP group in the Scottish Parliament has 62 MSP's, but in order for their budget to pass they need a majority of 65 MSP's to vote for it. The spending plans are likely to be supported by Glasgow Shettleston MSP John Mason, who despite being expelled from the SNP has indicated he would continue to support the party. It is unlikely the SNP could reach agreement with the Conservatives or Labour, and with only one MSP, Alba's support would be insufficient to get them over the line. That means the support of the Scottish Greens or Scottish Lib Dems is necessary. The Scottish Green party left a power-sharing deal with the government earlier this year. They have said the government needs to re-earn their trust but they are against axing cash for independence. According to campaign group Scotland in Union, the Scottish government has spent up to \u00a33.5m on independence since the 2021 Holyrood elections. That includes spending on papers, a now-axed independence minister and his staff as well as the failed court battle on whether the Scottish government is allowed to hold a constitutional referendum.\n\nJohn Swinney says his priorities are ending child poverty, growing the economy, investing in public services and supporting the path to net zero\n\nThe Scottish Budget sets out Holyrood's tax and spending plans for the next financial year, which runs from 1 April 2025 until 31 March 2026. The UK government has said its own Budget outlined last month would provide \u00a31.5bn this financial year, external and a further \u00a33.4bn next year for the Scottish government. Economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute have said this is \"likely to make the Scottish government\u2019s job of balancing its budget significantly easier\". However, First Minister John Swinney has said his government has \"difficult\" decisions to make, and that the extra Treasury funding is not \"nearly as much\" as has been claimed. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said the first minister's priorities were \"ending child poverty, growing the economy, investing in public services and supporting the path to net zero\". \u201cMinisters are committed to building as broad support as possible across Parliament in order to deliver the forthcoming budget,\" they added. \"Engagement with all parties is ongoing ahead of the draft budget being set out in the Scottish Parliament on 4 December.\"",
    "Will Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?\n\nElon Musk will co-head a new Department of Government Efficiency\n\nThe boss of Tesla and the social media site X, Elon Musk, suggested last month at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in New York City that it would be possible to cut \u201cat least $2 trillion\u201d from US government spending by eradicating \u201cwaste\u201d. Musk has now been appointed to co-head a new Department of Government Efficiency by the incoming US president, giving him an opportunity to try to put his plans into action. In the most recent fiscal year (from October 2023 to September 2024) the US federal government spent $6.75 trillion (\u00a35.3 trillion) according to the US Treasury, external. This means Musk\u2019s proposed cuts of $2 trillion would represent around a cut of around 30% of total federal government spending \u2014 also known as national spending in other countries.\n\nHow realistic is that proposal?\n\nTo answer that, it\u2019s helpful to break down the total spending figure. Around $880bn (13% of total US government spending) goes on interest payments on the national debt, which means that line of expenditure cannot be reduced without putting the US government in default. Around $1.46 trillion (22%) goes on Social Security, which primarily means pensions for Americans over the retirement age. This is a line of spending which is \u201cmandatory\u201d, meaning it must be spent by law on those eligible. Other large mandatory lines of government expenditure include Medicare - a government-funded health insurance program primarily serving Americans aged over 65.\n\nSo-called \u201cdiscretionary\u201d US government spending - outlays that are not permanently enshrined in law but have to be voted on annually by US lawmakers - includes defence ($874bn, 13%), transportation ($137bn, 2%) and education, training, employment and social services ($305bn, 5%). Altogether, discretionary spending accounted for around 25% of the total in the 2023 financial year according to the Congressional Budget Office, external, with more than half of that going to defence. In theory, discretionary spending would be easier for the incoming Trump administration to cut than mandatory spending.\n\nDonald Trump has said, external that Musk - and his co-head at the new Department of Government Efficiency, Vivek Ramaswamy - will achieve the savings from dismantling government bureaucracy, slashing excess regulations and restructuring government agencies. In an interview with the BBC in April 2023 Musk claimed to have reduced the staff of Twitter (now X) from 8,000 to 1,500 after acquiring the social network in 2022.\n\nYet if all of the $2 trillion in US government expenditure savings now being targeted by Musk were to come from discretionary spending, analysts calculate that entire agencies - from transport, to agriculture, to Homeland Security - would have to be entirely closed down. Discretionary spending accounted for, external only $1.7 trillion in 2023.\n\nMusk did not specify if he would aim to deliver $2 trillion in savings in a single year, or over a longer period, but many US public finance experts, including those who are in favour in principle of reductions in US government spending, are sceptical, external savings on such a scale can be found in the near term without either a collapse in the delivery of important government functions or sparking major public resistance.\n\nAfter taking control of the House of Representatives in 2022, Republican lawmakers have struggled to pass legislation to deliver considerably smaller cuts of $130bn, external in discretionary government spending after meeting opposition from other Republicans. It\u2019s also important to note that Donald Trump campaigned on a platform of making Social Security more financially generous, not less, by removing the income tax payable, external on it. And, on defence, Trump said, external he would build an \u201ciron dome missile defence shield\u201d around America, implying greater spending in this area, not cuts. Total US federal government spending as a share of the US economy in 2024 was around 23% according to the US Treasury, external. That\u2019s a considerably smaller share than national government spending in other developed countries. However, a large share of government spending in the US, including almost all school spending, external, is done at a state rather than a federal level, and states are funded, external by local sales and property taxes.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has projected, external that total US \u201cgeneral government expenditure\u201d, which includes spending by individual states, will be around 37.5% of its GDP in 2024. That compares with 43% in the UK, 48% in Germany and 57% in France. The US government is currently running an annual deficit - a shortfall between its spending and tax revenues - equal to around 6% of its economy. And America\u2019s national debt held by the public is currently equal to around 97%, external of the size of the economy. The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) think tank has projected, external that this is currently set to climb to 125% by 2035. The CRFB has projected that absent major spending reductions, Donald Trump\u2019s planned tax cuts would considerably widen the US deficit in the coming decade and push up the US national debt to 143% by the middle of the next decade.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "A wildlife photographer from East Yorkshire has captured a rare ghostly shadow phenomenon while out spotting seabirds. Chris Atkinson, 44, was looking for peregrine falcons at Bempton Cliffs, near Bridlington, on 18 October when he spotted a circular rainbow in the mist. Mr Atkinson, who works at Hull Prison, said he spotted something \"different, very unusual\", but did not realise it was his own shadow looming large until he began moving to get better light for his photograph. The phenomenon is called a Brocken spectre, which the Met Office describes as \"a large shadow of an observer cast onto cloud or mist\", named after the German mountain on which it was first noted in 1780.\n\nAfter getting a positive reaction to the photo from friends and colleagues on social media, the photo was shared by the RSPB Bempton Cliffs Facebook page, receiving more than 1,300 responses. Mr Atkinson, from Bilton, near Hull, said: \"All the positive comments have been amazing. It's had a really lovely response and it's been nice to see the reaction to it.\" The keen photographer said he normally captured wildlife and sunsets and had some interesting photos of the moon, but this unusual photo was now going \"straight to the top of the pile in my photo albums\".\n\nAnother example of a Brocken spectre captured in Hayfield in the Peak District\n\nDannie Jackson, visitor experience manager at RSPB Bempton Cliffs, said the team had not seen any examples of Brocken spectres at the nature reserve before. She added: \"This isn't a phenomenon that occurs very often. The weather conditions have to be quite specific in order to get this kind of image. It is more about being in the right place, right time.\" A spokesperson for the Met Office said: \"A Brocken spectre is a phenomenon where an observer\u2019s shadow is cast onto a hill partially shrouded in mist. \"The illusion makes the shadow of the person (or 'spectre') appear much larger than reality and at a considerable distance away.\" Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.",
    "Girl left near death after being drugged by mother\n\nA urine test on the girl showed the presence of unprescribed ibuprofen\n\nA child developed a life-threatening infection after being repeatedly drugged by her mother, a judge has found. The unprescribed medication was administered for more than a year and led to the girl needing a long stay at a children\u2019s hospital, unable to eat or drink and needing 10 blood transfusions. The judge found her mother\u2019s actions caused the girl, now aged 15, to also suffer significant emotional and psychological harm. Two other women accused of harming their children in the same way at the same hospital around the same time were found to have not done so following a Family Court hearing. The children were all long stay patients \u2013 often on the same ward \u2013 at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital during 2020 and 2021. Each came from separate, previously unconnected families but developed unexplained medical problems that led to their mothers being arrested. The women, who had all stayed with their children at the hospital, were accused of making their children ill by administering unprescribed drugs and by deliberately contaminating their feeding lines with faecal material. All the children made a rapid recovery after their mothers were arrested. Reporting restrictions prevent the naming of any of the families involved in the case. All three children - the girl and two young boys, now aged five and six, presented with chronic digestive \u2013 gastroenterological \u2013 illnesses and an apparent inability to eat and drink normally. Each had to have lines inserted into a vein to deliver nutrients to keep them alive. They had an exceptionally high number of bacterial infections in their lines, leading to life-threatening sepsis. Clinicians at Sheffield Children's Hospital could not understand why the children were so ill and eventually concluded they might be the victim of fabricated or induced illness (FII), external. This is described by the NHS as \u201ca rare form of child abuse\u201d, where a parent exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in a child. The actions of each mother were suggested to have led to multiple, avoidable medical interventions, prolonged hospitalisation and brought each child close to death. The mothers of the two boys were found not to have done so.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, who has two other children, was arrested in February 2021 after a urine test on her daughter showed the presence of ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, which had not been prescribed. A Family Court hearing in Leeds in 2023, the judgment from which has only now been published, concluded that from September 2019 to February 2021, the woman, known as MR, administered unprescribed medication to her daughter. She was given both ibuprofen and piroxicam, a strong pain killer. While the girl was aware her mother was giving her the drugs, she did not know what they were. Judge Mr Justice Poole concluded taking the drugs had led to the teenager suffering abdominal pain and inflammation, nausea and vomiting, stomach ulcers and gastro-intestinal bleeding. MR also gave her daughter the laxative Bisacodyl, which the judge said led to her suffering recurrent diarrhoea. The drugs caused the girl to undergo unnecessary medical interventions, including 10 blood transfusions and surgery to stop ulcers bleeding. She also had to have a gastric tube fitted, lines inserted to allow nutrition, and multiple endoscopies, in which a camera is inserted into the body to investigate a condition. An investigation into the mother showed that she had required periods of hospital treatment herself for symptoms that were never fully medically explained, including \u201cpseudo-seizures,\u201d the authenticity of which was questioned by both clinicians and her own family. At the time of her arrest, she was on repeat prescriptions of a strong painkiller for chronic back pain. She also had mental health issues. The judge concluded that the relationship between mother and daughter at the hospital became \u201cvery intense and unhealthy,\u201d exacerbated by Covid restrictions. \u201cThe isolation and mutual dependency\u2026provided a culture within which unusual and harmful behaviours could develop,\u201d the judge wrote. Even after her mother\u2019s arrest, the girl continued to take ibuprofen \u201cin an attempt to make herself ill, to cover up for her mother,\u201d he added. In April 2021, the girl was discharged from hospital into the care of her father and grandparents. She is able to eat normally and has not had any further infections. She attends school but continues to complain of abdominal pain and remains under the care of a paediatrician. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and South Yorkshire Police have been approached for comment. The other two mothers were arrested in October 2021. Searches of the rooms they used or had access to did not find evidence to suggest they had been harming their children. There was also no evidence, the judge said, that any of the three women had tampered with their children\u2019s feeding lines. He added that national guidelines for clinicians had not been followed as it should have been. This meant when the mothers were referred to social services and the police, the NHS trust had not gathered the evidence it could have done. At that point, the \u201caccepted narrative\u201d at the Trust was that each mother was guilty of FII (fabricated or induced illness), he said. Dr Jeff Perring, executive medical director at Sheffield Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u201cThis was a finding of fact hearing in the Family Court and, as the judgment makes clear, it was not an inquiry into the conduct of the Trust and its clinicians. \u201cThe 2021 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidance referred to in the judgement is fully embedded at the Trust. Our policies and procedures are reviewed to factor in learning and ensure they continue to be robust and reflect best practice.\u201d",
    "Last supermoon of 2024 captured in stunning photos across the UK\n\nThe Beaver Moon - the final supermoon of the year has made a dazzling appearance across parts of the UK on Friday night. It's not quite as bright as last month's Hunter's supermoon but should still provide an impressible spectacle for sky gazers, although clouds may obscure the view in some places. However with the next supermoon not until October 2025, it's worth capturing a glimpse of this one if you can. Here are some of the best images sent in to BBC Weather Watchers, along with some agency pictures.\n\nFull Moons throughout the year are given names that reflect what is happening in nature. November's full Moon is called the Beaver Moon, probably because beavers are particularly active at this time of year as they prepare for the winter months ahead. Another interpretation is that Native American tribes would set beaver traps before the swamps froze, ensuring a supply of warm winter furs.\n\nThere are about three or four supermoons each year. This year has already brought three - the Blue moon in August, September's Harvest moon and the Hunter's moon in October.

    "Sarah Everard was murdered by serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens in 2021\n\nA serving Metropolitan Police officer who accessed files relating to Sarah Everard's murder has been dismissed. PC Myles McHugh committed gross misconduct by viewing the confidential files without proper reason, a tribunal has found. Former Det Con Hannah Rebbeck and Sgt Mark Harper were also found by the tribunal to have committed gross misconduct. Ms Rebbeck has since left the force but would have been dismissed had she still been serving, while Sgt Harper was issued with a final written warning. The offences took place between 5 and 15 March 2021, soon after the 33-year-old marketing executive was kidnapped and killed by serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens.\n\nPC McHugh repeatedly accessed the police system to search for details including Ms Everard\u2019s medical history, employment, character and lifestyle, the panel heard. Ms Rebbeck also looked for information about the 33-year-old that was not connected with her duties multiple times, which the panel heard had \u201ccentred on her own morbid curiosity\u201d. Another serving officer, Det Con Tyrone Ward, and two other former officers who have since retired - Insp Akinwale Ajose-Adeogun and Det Sgt Robert Butters - faced the same gross misconduct charge. However, the panel found they had had a legitimate reason for accessing the information and were not in breach of the standards of police professional behaviour. Another serving officer, PC Clare Tett, will face a separate gross misconduct hearing on a date to be set.\n\nWayne Couzens was given a whole-life prison sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Ms Everard\n\nMet Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said the force's thoughts were with Ms Everard's family and friends. \"We have apologised to them for the added distress this case has caused and I recognise the wider questions and concerns this raises,\" he said. None of the officers was directly involved in the criminal investigation into Ms Everard's murder. No evidence was found that any of them inappropriately shared the information with anyone else, the Met said.\n\nThe misconduct hearing followed an audit of those who accessed files relating to the case to see if they had had a good reason to do so. In total, 104 officers and police staff were initially identified as having potentially accessed files without legitimate cause. A majority of those of were subject to forms of discipline including written warnings and \"reflective practice\" training sessions. In most cases, those who accessed the files did so \"out of curiosity\", Mr Cundy said. \"When spoken to, they were remorseful, apologised, admitted poor judgement and were keen to engage in training. \u201cWe know that honest mistakes can be made, and the most serious outcomes relate to those who were deliberately evasive or tried to avoid accountability. Those actions are not compatible with the values of the Met.\u201d",
    "'Barlinnie destroyed me, but it also made me a better person'\n\nJimmy Boyle was once dubbed Scotland's most dangerous man\n\nJimmy Boyle saw his opportunity. Reaching over the table, he felt the crack as his fist connected with the governor of Barlinnie Prison\u2019s jaw. Within moments, the guards were on top of him. Boyle\u2019s behaviour behind bars, where he was regularly involved in rioting and attacks on prison guards, earned him the tag of Scotland\u2019s most dangerous man. But his life turned around after being placed in Barlinnie\u2019s experimental - and highly controversial - special unit. The former gangland enforcer, who became a respected sculptor and novelist, has spoken about his experiences as part of a new BBC Scotland documentary telling the story of the 142-year-old jail, which is earmarked for closure. Boyle served 14 years for the murder of gangland adversary William \u2018Babs\u2019 Rooney in 1967. He has always denied carrying out the killing.\n\nDuring his early incarceration, he waged a one-man \u201cwar of attrition\u201d on the prison system from inside Barlinnie\u2019s imposing walls. \u201cBarlinnie Prison destroyed me, but it also made me a better person,\u201d Boyle, now 80, told the documentary. \u201cEvery cell they put me in to, I broke up, I tore down and I got another sentence. \u201cWhen I continued to rebel, they then put me in what was called a silent cell. They would come in and beat me.\u201d Even a transfer to solitary confinement was not enough to stop his campaign of disorder. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got is a plastic pot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo I did what you do in the pot and I covered myself and when they opened the door, I just ran at them. The three of them just slammed the door. \u201cEvery time I went to the toilet, I was sort of re-arming myself. There was this war of attrition. They didn\u2019t know that I was fearless.\u201d\n\nBarlinnie is due to close in the near future after more than 140 years of housing some of Scotland's most violent prisoners\n\nBoyle\u2019s impact on the prison system was such that it was decided, in the early 1970s, that he could not be contained by normal means. He was instead transferred to the infamous \u201ccages\u201d at the former Porterfield Prison in Inverness, where the only facility was a concrete block on which to sleep. He was stripped naked and given a blanket as his only possession. On the wall, a list of rules stated that no prisoner should have been in the cell for more than six months. Boyle was there for four-and-a-half years. On one occasion, he says he persuaded a corrupt officer to conceal knives so that he could pass them on to other prisoners in the bathroom. During the ensuing attack, he was knocked unconscious. He was taken to hospital, where a medic advised officers to keep him in overnight due to fears for his life. The guards were unrelenting, taking Boyle back to the cage. He awoke \u201ccovered in blood\u201d with almost 50 stitches in his head.\n\nBut Boyle\u2019s life was transformed back at Barlinnie with the introduction of the \u201cspecial unit\u201d. Through a green door, some of the country\u2019s most violent offenders were kept in conditions far removed from those of prisoners on the other side. Shielded from view, staff and inmates would mingle in more relaxed settings. Cells had beds, television sets and more modern conveniences. Prisoners were even able wear their own clothes and have pets such as cats, Guinea pigs and rabbits. It also featured expressive activities, including sculpture under the gaze of pioneering art therapist Joyce Laing. \u201cArt was so far from our world. It was for the toffs,\u201d said Boyle. \u201cShe [Joyce] brought in this seven pounds of clay. I did this portrait and it was like a dam bursting for me. It was the first positive thing I ever did in my life.\u201d\n\nBoyle\u2019s work, which featured sculptures of chained fists and the scales of justice, quickly caught the eye of gallery owner Richard Demarco. He offered Boyle an exhibition space at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1974. To public outrage, Boyle was allowed out to attend the show. \u201cI thought he has to be seen as an artist,\u201d Mr Demarco told the programme. \u201cI found myself accused of bringing dishonour to the meaning of art.\u201d By the time Boyle was released in 1980, he had also become a bestselling author, - but the controversy over the special unit had started to rankle with elements of the Scottish public. Press reports of alcohol and drug-fuelled parties did little to quell the disquiet and the unit eventually closed in 1994. A total of 36 of Scotland\u2019s most violent and difficult offenders passed through the green door in its 21 years of operation. Of those, only four reoffended. One inmate took his own life and one other suffered a prescription drug overdose. No staff were ever harmed during the unit\u2019s lifespan.\n\nBoyle later established youth programmes and schemes to prevent those released from prison from reoffending. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be here if the special unit had not been in existence,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made a contribution to society. Do you want people like me to come out of prison the way I have come out? Or do you want someone who is going to come out and attack somebody?\u201d The modern Barlinnie is a world away from the violence-ridden \u201cbig hoose\u201d of Boyle\u2019s day. Since opening in the city\u2019s Riddrie in 1882, its five blocks have been overcrowded, with prisoners living in confined spaces. It was not until 2004 that every cell had its own toilet. Until then, inmates still had to take part in \u201cslopping out\u201d their own buckets into a communal toilet. Such draconian conditions, combined with prisoners often on opposite sides of warring factions outside its walls, earned it a foreboding and violent reputation. The promise that misbehaving children would \u201cend up in Barlinnie\u201d has been a quintessential parenting tool for generations. As one former inmate described it: \u201cBarlinnie is a bit like Glasgow\u2019s Guantanamo Bay\u201d.\n\nPresent-day inmates can take classes to increase their level of education, while a family centre allows prisoners access to their young children in a more relaxed setting. Levels of violence, while still an issue, are vastly reduced from Boyle\u2019s time. But for governor Mick Stoney, there are new challenges to face. About 80% of prisoners who arrive in Barlinnie have issues with alcohol or drugs. Mr Stoney describes an \u201congoing and constant battle\u201d with illicit substances getting in to the prison. The documentary shows officers searching the cell of one prisoner after a drone was caught overnight delivering a package into an open window. Mr Stoney said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that drugs would make their way to inmates.\n\nGovernor Mick Stoney said it was 'inevitable' that drugs would make their way inside prisons\n\nInmate Jamie, who was returned to the prison for breaking the conditions of an ankle tag, became addicted to drugs during his initial five-year sentence for assault and robbery. He had been clean for five months, before relapsing. He told the programme that coming back to the prison was \u201clike taking someone out of rehab and putting them in a drug den\u201d. \u201cI know out there, I need to go looking for it. I don\u2019t need to that in here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll come and find me. And it\u2019ll come and find me when I\u2019m down in my darkest moments.\u201d Barlinnie is due to be replaced by a new prison, HMP Glasgow, on the site of the former Provan Gas Works. No date has yet been set for its closure. Mr Stoney said it was a chance to build a new legacy for the prison. \u201cEverybody wants a pound of flesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a retributive kind of approach to punishment, but restriction of liberty is a punishment. \u201cI want to replace the notoriety and famousness of Barlinnie with a positive image for Glasgow. That this prison can make a difference to people, a real difference.\u201d\n\nEpisode one of Inside Barlinnie airs on BBC Scotland at 22:00 on 8 October.

    "The number of monitored bathing waters in England rated as poor and unfit for swimming has more than doubled, from 18 to 37. Out of the 450 sites regularly tested this summer for bacteria related to sewage discharges, 92% reached the minimum standards for bathing, a slight fall from 96% last year. The Environment Agency - which carried out the testing - says those figures are in part due to 27 new sites being monitored this year, of which 18 were rated poor.\n\nWater minister Emma Hardy blamed England\u2019s water companies and said it underlined the need for tougher regulation. Environment Agency Chair Alan Lovell said the results came against a background of increading demand for bathing sites across the country. \"While overall bathing water quality has improved in recent decades due to targeted investment and robust regulation, today\u2019s results show there is much work still to do, particularly to bring our inland bathing waters up to standard,\" he said. The figures show a notable difference between the quality of bathing sites on the coast and inland. 95% of coastal waters met minimum standards this year, compared to only 53% of rivers and lakes. The Environment Agency says that\u2019s because salt water can act as a natural disinfectant and the sea naturally disperses pollutants faster.\n\nThere has been mounting criticism of England's bathing water quality in recent years, as more data has become available. \"The Government\u2019s own data shows that swimming in our inland bathing sites poses serious health risks, highlighting the failure of regulators to protect waterways from polluters,\" he said. The designated bathing sites are tested between 10 and 20 times a year for bacteria that are linked to sewage discharges. At the end each of season the Environment Agency gives them a rating which is based on their results of the previous four years. Excellent, good or sufficient means they have met the minimum standards \u2013 while poor means they have not. A spokesman for Water UK, which represents the water industry, said that the quality of English bathing water had improved since the 1990s but that the water companies agreed that more needed to be done to reduce sewage discharges. The companies are currently waiting for the regulator Ofwat to approve billions of pounds of investment in infrastructure paid for by higher customer bills.",
    "Dissanayake was elected on a promise to combat corruption and restore stability\n\nThe left-leaning alliance of Sri Lanka's new leader has secured a landslide victory in the country's snap parliamentary elections. Official results show President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's National People's Power (NPP) coalition scored a two-thirds majority in parliament, with 159 seats. President Dissanayake\u2019s coalition got nearly 62% of the vote, winning even in the Tamil-dominated Jaffna Peninsula for the first time since independence from Britain in 1948. \"Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance,\" Dissanayake said in a brief statement on social media platform X, previously knows as Twitter.\n\nCorrespondents say the victory has cemented a transformation of the island-nation's political landscape which for decades was dominated by established political parties of family dynasties. The landslide mandate will also allow him to push through economic and constitutional changes he had promised during the campaign. In the outgoing assembly, Dissanayake's party had just three seats. The 55-year-old earlier told reporters that he believed this was \"a crucial election that will mark a turning point in Sri Lanka\". Sajith Premadasa, the man Dissanayake defeated in the presidential elections, led the opposition alliance. Dissanayake called for snap elections shortly after he became president to seek a fresh mandate to pursue his policies. There was \"no point continuing with a parliament that is not in line with what the people want\", he had said. Nearly two-thirds of former MPs had chosen not to run for re-election, including prominent members of the former ruling Rajapaksa dynasty. Out of the 225 seats in the parliament, 196 MPs were directly elected. The rest were nominated by parties based on the percentage of votes they get in what is known as proportional representation.\n\nState of economy was one of the key issues for many voters. High inflation, food and fuel shortages precipitated a political crisis in 2022 which led to the ousting of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. His successor Ranil Wickremesinghe managed to negotiate a bailout package worth $3bn with the International Monetary Fund - but many Sri Lankans continue to feel economic hardship. The number of people living below the poverty line in Sri Lanka has risen to 25.9% in the past four years. The World Bank expects the economy to grow by only 2.2% in 2024. The coalition will now be under massive pressure to perform and live up to their campaign promises. Dissanayake has promised to repay the country's debt, reform its political culture, and punish members of past administrations for corruption. Sri Lanka's economic situation remains precarious \u2013 and the main focus is still on providing essential goods and services. How the country progresses from this point will be a real challenge for the new government.",
    "Two grisly killings involving teenagers have shaken the French city of Marseille, which has long battled organised crime and drug-related violence. Last week, a 14-year-old murdered a taxi driver during a botched revenge mission for the brutal killing of a 15-year-old. Marseille prosecutor Nicolas Bessone has warned that the city's drug lords were recruiting young boys to kill \"without any remorse or reflection\". During a press conference on Sunday, Mr Bessone described the \"unprecedented savagery\" of the 15-year-old's murder linked to a feud between two gangs known as the \"DZ Mafia\" and the \"Blacks\".\n\nAccording to prosecutors, a member of the DZ Mafia, who is currently in prison, hired the boy for \u20ac2,000 ($2,192; \u00a31,676) to \"intimidate\" a competitor by setting fire to his door. The teenager was spotted and searched by rivals from the Blacks gang, who then stabbed him and set him on fire after finding a gun. \"He was stabbed 50 times and taken to the Fonscolombes housing estate, where he was burned alive,\" said Mr Bessone. A friend, also aged 15, managed to escape. The DZ Mafia member in jail then hired a 14-year-old via social media to exact revenge two days later, promising to pay him \u20ac50,000 ($55,000; \u00a342,000). However, the boy shot dead taxi driver Nessim Ramdane, 36, before reaching his target because the driver refused to wait while he carried out his mission, Mr Bessone said. The prisoner who had hired the teenager then phoned the police to turn him in. The minor was taken into custody and admitted shooting the driver, but insisted that the shot had \"gone off accidentally\". Franck Rastoul, a public prosecutor at the Aix-en-Provence court of appeal, has warned of the scourge of drug-related violence, saying that young people were \"intoxicated by easy drug money\" to the point of \"total disregard for human life\". Young people are also often victims of the drug trade. In 2021, the BBC reported a 14-year-old boy was shot dead by a young man on a scooter outside the Les Marronniers housing estate in northern Marseille. Two other boys - aged 14 and eight - were wounded. In March this year French police staged a major operation to seize drug money and weapons in Marseille. Authorities said that within a few weeks, they made 627 arrests, recovered 450kg of cannabis and 19 weapons, as well as \u20ac1.6m ($1.75m; \u00a31.3m) in cash. The two latest murders mean that the number of drug-related killings in Marseille has risen to 17 since the start of 2024.",

Prince William arrived in South Africa on Monday for a visit that will focus on his Earthshot environmental prize and supporting young people. He met children from the Ocean View, Masiphumelele and Langa townships, many of whom have challenging home lives - rugby is used to support them as well as unite communities and mentor schoolchildren. The prince was shown around by some of South Africa\u2019s most well-known rugby players, including former Springboks Joel Stransky and Percy Montgomery.\n\nBut it was the sight of Tendai Mtawarira, better known as \u201cThe Beast\u201d and South Africa\u2019s most capped prop, that brought back some vivid memories. \u201cThe last time I shook his hand was back in 2013 in Cardiff where we\u2019d just won the Prince of Wales cup against Wales and he usually makes a turn in the changing room,\u201d said Mtawarira. \u201cI was only only wearing my towel and was half naked back then so he said it was a change for me to be fully dressed.\u201d Prince William joined in a training session with some young players where his royal status was no barrier to the odd rough tackle. Tom Solimi from the Ocean View Secondary School, who has international ambitions and wants to be a South African Springbok, was one of several who tried their luck coaxed on by teammates. \u201cIt was just a game, it was just a bit of rugby,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to play a little game to make him welcome, and we really enjoyed it.\u201d The visit was organised by the Atlas Charity, which was created by England 2003 Rugby World Cup winner Jason Leonard. He was in the township to show the prince around. \u201cSome of the boys and girls want to get away from their normal home life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come to a place like this that is a safe sanctuary where they can spend two to three hours here being a child.\u201d\n\nWith so many former rugby players on the pitch, the prince\u2019s own performance came in for some scrutiny. The critique from Leonard was kind but cautious. \u201cHe\u2019s not too bad. He said it had been a few years since he played, so you\u2019ve got to cut him some slack.\u201d Prince William is in South Africa this week for his Earthshot Prize awards ceremony. The prize supports eco-friendly innovations from around the world, with five winners each receiving \u00a31m. The prince, who will be wearing sustainable clothing during his time in Cape Town this week, started his visit by meeting 120 young people from across Africa and South East Asia who are part of the Earthshot Climate Leaders Youth Programme. He told them: \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to do is change the world. \"This is the generation that is going to do that. You are creating solutions and a better life for all of us\". The Earthshot Prize winners will be announced at a ceremony on Wednesday night in Cape Town.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEngland fought back in the second half to overcome an impressive Canada side in Vancouver and retain their WXV1 title. The victory extends the Red Roses' winning run to 20 games, but the match proved to be their toughest test since their last defeat - in the World Cup final by New Zealand in 2022. Canada, who would also have clinched the WXV1 title with a win, spent a large portion of the first half in England's 22, but could only manage one early try through scrum-half Justine Pelletier. Prop Maud Muir quickly responded for the world number ones, but it proved to be a rare low-scoring start for John Mitchell's side. Captain Alex Tessier got the amateur side back ahead with an excellent team try, before scores from replacement prop Sarah Bern and lock Zoe Aldcroft meant England retained the WXV1 title they won in Auckland last year. Aldcroft's try came in the final play of the game and left Kevin Rouet's Canada rueing numerous missed opportunities as their six-game winning run came to an end and they fell to a first loss of 2024. \"I think we won ugly - sometimes you have to do that,\" Mitchell said. \"That was a proper Test match and that is great for us, so we will take a lot of good from this. \"This tournament was everything we wanted and needed, we have got to keep learning and getting better.\"\n\nEngland's Marlie Packer remains the only captain to lift the WXV1 trophy\n\nWXV1 hosts Canada, ranked second in the world, have stepped up in 2024 to emerge as the possible leading contenders to challenge England at next year's World Cup. In front of a much improved crowd of 5,000 fans at BC Place, Canada started with a sense of urgency, turning down shots at goal to go in search of a try. Comfortable wins over Ireland and France had ensured their shot at the title, and the muted celebrations when Pelletier slipped through Hannah Botterman's attempted tackle to grab the opening try showed nothing less than a statement victory was the plan. A powerful carry off the back of the scrum from England number eight Alex Matthews helped set up Muir to barge her way over to quickly respond in an action-packed opening 10 minutes. The Red Roses had started slowly before racking up the tries in convincing WXV1 wins over New Zealand and the United States, but were matched throughout the first half by their opponents. Rather than assert their dominance, England's unforced errors opened the door for Canada, who failed to capitalise on their territorial superiority, with wing Paige Farries held up over the line by Holly Aitchison at the end of a competitive half.\n\nWith full-back Ellie Kildunne in the sin-bin for deliberately slowing the ball down, England were punished when Tessier raced clear to finish off a free-flowing move that started in her side's own half and put the hosts 12-7 up. As soon as Kildunne returned, wing Bo Westcombe-Evans was shown a yellow card for a deliberate slap down, but a number of handling errors from Canada meant they were unable to again take advantage of the extra player. England's most recent defeat came against the Black Ferns in the 2022 World Cup showpiece, which ended the Red Roses' record 30-Test winning streak. Having failed to close out that title decider when it mattered most, the Red Roses are unbeaten since - and showed steel to eke out the victory in Vancouver. Mitchell turned to his bench - which he has nicknamed 'the super eight' - to seal the win against Canada and Bern delivered, with flanker Morwenna Talling also impressing after coming on for captain Marlie Packer. \"The super eight that came on gave us momentum, energy and front-foot ball, which is exactly what we asked from them at half-time,\" Packer added. \"It worked for us and we got the result we wanted.\" Canada defeated New Zealand to win the Pacific Four Series earlier this year, but their inexperience showed in the closing stages as they continued to drop or kick the ball away at vital moments. However, their performance indicates a rerun of the 2014 World Cup final - the last time England became world champions - could be on the cards next year.\n\nThe three-tier tournament was created to offer consistent annual international fixtures outside of World Cup years. Each WXV tier consists of six countries who have qualified via continental tournaments and play-offs: WXV1 in Canada featured the three sides from the 2024 Women's Six Nations - England, France and Ireland - plus the top three from the Pacific Four Series - Canada, New Zealand and the United States. WXV2 in South Africa contained the remaining Six Nations sides - Scotland, Wales and Italy - as well as South Africa, Australia and Japan. WXV3 in Dubai was made up of Spain, Madagascar, Fiji, Hong Kong, Netherlands and Samoa. With each tier split into two pools, teams play the three sides in the other pool, with final placings determined by a points table. Four points are awarded for a win and two for a draw, with the potential to pick up bonus points for scoring four tries or losing by seven points or fewer.",

    "Which was the greatest F1 wet-weather drive?\n\nMax Verstappen produced a superb drive to win the Sao Paulo Grand Prix on Sunday, coming through the field from 17th on the grid in treacherous conditions. The Dutchman described it as \"definitely the best\" of his 62 Formula 1 grand prix wins, but where does it rank among the great wet-weather drives? We have selected seven of the best from some of the greats of the sport. Make your selection from the list below...\n\nStarting eighth in horrendously wet conditions on the original 8.8-mile Spa-Francorchamps circuit, Clark quickly moved to the front in his Lotus. By the end of the race, only Jack Brabham had managed to stay on the same lap - and he was nearly five minutes behind the Scot. Clark - considered by many to be the greatest driver of his era - hated Spa, considering it far too dangerous. But he still won there four times on the trot, from 1962-65.\n\nAnother overwhelmingly dominant win for a Scotsman in atrocious conditions on perhaps the ultimate F1 challenge, the 14.2-mile Nurburgring Nordschleife circuit. The fog was so thick drivers could only see 100 yards in front of them and the rain became so bad the track had channels of water running across it in several places. Stewart won by just over four minutes in his Matra and when he got back to the pits, the first question he asked team boss Ken Tyrrell was \"who died?'\" Thankfully, the answer that day was nobody.\n\nAyrton Senna delivered many wet-weather masterclasses in his career, including his first F1 win in Portugal in 1985, but perhaps all were surpassed on a cold and very, very wet April day at Donington. From fourth on the grid, McLaren's Senna was fifth going into the first corner. He passed Michael Schumacher's Benetton exiting Turn One, went around the outside of Karl Wendlinger's Sauber through the Craner Curves and inside Damon Hill's Williams into McLean's. He now only had great rival Alain Prost ahead of him and Senna went past the Frenchman at the hairpin before the end of the first lap. F1's YouTube channel describes it as Senna's 'Lap of the Gods'. He remained untouchable throughout the race and by the end only Hill was on the same lap, the Brazilian winning by 83 seconds.\n\nThere were years of overwhelming dominance ahead for Michael Schumacher and Ferrari but his first win for the Italian team was achieved in what BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson described as a \"dog\" of a car, lacking grip, downforce and balance. Schumacher's greatness in sodden conditions made the difference in Barcelona. From third on the grid, he made a bad start and dropped back but by lap 13 he was past Williams' Jacques Villeneuve and into the lead. Regularly lapping five seconds faster than anyone else, Schumacher was one of only six drivers to finish and in a class of his own.\n\nThere were downpours aplenty at Silverstone and many of the drivers were caught out, including Jenson Button and Felipe Massa, who went off five times as he finished last. Up front, from fourth on the grid, Lewis Hamilton had no such problems, mastering the conditions for one of his greatest wins. Andrew Benson wrote of the Englishman's performance: \"This was a day when one driver made the others look like amateurs, when his performance reached such heights that it scarcely seems possible. \"At times, Hamilton was four or five seconds faster than his pursuers, even team-mate Heikki Kovalainen in a similar car. \"These sorts of margins are not unknown in F1, but they tend to happen only when the very greatest drivers are at their best in conditions that test the field to the absolute limit.\"\n\nJenson Button often excelled in changeable wet-dry conditions and Canada 2011 provided surely his most remarkable F1 victory. There were similarities with Sao Paulo on Sunday: Montreal was a four-hour race, featuring a two-hour red-flag delay and five safety cars. McLaren's Button was 21st and last with 30 laps to go, after two collisions and a drive-through penalty, but he fought his way through the field thanks to choosing the right time to change to intermediate tyres and then dry-weather slicks. On lap 65 he passed Red Bull's Mark Webber and Mercedes' Michael Schumacher to move from fourth to second and closed on race leader Sebastian Vettel. Going into the last lap, Vettel appeared to be just out of reach but the pressure applied by Button led to the German putting a wheel a couple of inches wide of the dry line, his Red Bull went into a slide and Button was through to take a barely believable victory.\n\nFrom 17th on the grid, it appeared to be a case of damage limitation for Max Verstappen with championship rival Lando Norris on pole. Not a bit of it. Verstappen gained six places on the first lap, and by lap 12 was up to sixth on the back of a four-car group fighting for third, with the top two of George Russell and Norris only eight seconds ahead. As the rain got heavier and Russell and Norris pitted for fresh tyres, Red Bull kept Verstappen out. A red flag halted the race with the Dutchman in second, behind Alpine's Esteban Ocon, and allowed them a 'free' change of tyres. After the race resumed, a crash for Williams' Franco Colapinto led to a safety car. At the restart, Verstappen came from a long way back to pass Ocon into Turn One and he disappeared into the distance. His fastest lap of 1:20.472 was more than a second quicker than any other driver.\n\nSorry, this vote cannot be loaded. In order to vote you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

    "Lebanon says 21 killed in air strike in country\u2019s north\n\nResidents said there was no warning before the strike\n\nAt least 21 people have been killed and eight others injured in a rare Israeli air strike in northern Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry says. The strike hit a residential building in Aitou, a predominantly Christian village far from the areas where the Israeli military has carried out thousands of strikes targeting the armed Shia Islamist group Hezbollah. Residents said a family recently displaced by the war had been living there. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reports. But it came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to \"continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon - including Beirut\".\n\n\"Everything is according to operational considerations. We have proven this recently and we will continue to prove it in the coming days as well,\" he added. He was speaking during a visit to a military base in northern Israel where a drone launched by the Iran-backed group killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded dozens on Sunday night. The military said it was investigating how the drone evaded its sophisticated air defence systems and hit the Golani Brigade training facility near the town of Binyamina. It was one of Hezbollah\u2019s deadliest attacks on Israel in over a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza. Hezbollah said it was a response to deadly Israeli attacks in Lebanon, which the country\u2019s health ministry says has killed almost 1,700 people over the past month. Most of the Israeli air strikes over the past week have struck in the majority Shia south and the Bekaa Valley in the east - areas where Hezbollah is strong. Aitou, a Maronite Christian community located in the mountains near the north-western coastal city of Tripoli, was not a place which would have expected to be attacked. \"Oh mother Mary,\" gasped one man as he walked through the devastation wrought on the village. In the smoke and dust, bodies could be seen on the ground. Residents said there was no warning, just a single, massive blast. However, they also said several families displaced by the war in the south had recently moved to Aitou, and that the house which was hit had been rented out to new people just two weeks ago.\n\nRescue workers attended the scene of the strike, which was covered in dust and debris\n\nA Lebanese security source told AFP news agency that the building was \"targeted shortly after a man had arrived in a car\". The Lebanese health ministry said it was carrying out DNA tests to determine the identities of the remains recovered by first responders at the scene. The main focus of Israel's military operations has been in the east, the suburbs of Beirut and the south - where there have been incidents involving UN peacekeepers. On Monday, a spokesperson for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon would not move from any positions, again defying calls by Israel to withdraw. The UN Security Council has expressed strong concern over some UN troops being injured during the Israeli military's offensive against Hezbollah. Also on Monday, the Israeli military said a strike in the southern Nabatieh area had killed the commander of the anti-tank unit of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan Force. Hezbollah has not commented on the report. The military also said it had struck Hezbollah launchers used to fire a number of rockets into central and northern Israel on Monday. Most of the rockets were intercepted or fell in open areas, according to the military. One woman was lightly injured by a barrage of 15 rockets that were fired towards the northern town of Karmiel. Israeli police also said debris from an interception fell in the Holon area, south of Tel Aviv, without causing any injuries or damage. The Israeli military said Hezbollah had fired around 115 projectiles into Israel on Monday. Early on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel's air force had over the past day struck \"more than 200 Hezbollah terrorist targets in southern Lebanon and deep within Lebanon, including terrorist cells, anti-tank missile posts, and surface-to-surface missile launchers\", in coordination with ground troops. In southern Lebanon, it said it eliminated \"dozens of terrorists\", dismantled Hezbollah infrastructure and located \"vast quantities\" of weapons and equipment.",

They shouted \"stop the torture, stop the pain\", in reference to the use of animal skins and fur by fashion house Louis Vuitton, where Williams serves as men's creative director.

Rating Game Music said, external the album \"reminds us why he\u2019s one of the greats\", but added: \"Overall, this album doesn\u2019t feel like a monumental release - it\u2019s more like a creative purge, a way for Kendrick to get a few ideas out of his system.\" \"My guess? The real project is on the horizon\". Some had speculated that Taylor Swift would make an appearance, but the pop sensation does not appear to have made it on. The pair have worked together before, when the rapper appeared on Swift's track Bad Blood from the album 1989. However, SZA lends her voice to two tracks, luther and gloria. Lamar and SZA recently sat down for an interview with Harper's Bazaar, which covered a wide range of topics from spirituality to mental health. Other tracks include tv off, dodger blue, peekaboo, and gnx. On the opening track, wacced out murals, Lamar refers to his upcoming Super Bowl performance. The coveted gig takes place in the middle of the NFL season finale and has a massive audience among Americans. However, it caused some upset among Lil Wayne fans who thought he should have been picked instead. \"I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down,\" the Compton rapper sings. \"Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me.\" The new album also follows a long-running spat with Drake, which goes back years, but it escalated to new levels earlier this year, as the two rappers traded insults in a flurry of new songs. The feud resulted in some huge tracks, notably Lamar's Not Like Us. Powered by an irresistible DJ Mustard beat, Not Like Us broke Spotify records, becoming the hip-hop song with the most plays in a single day. It went on to top the US charts, and reached number six in the UK - making it Lamar's biggest hit as a solo artist.",
    "Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election\n\nIn China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House. \u201cNone of us wants to see a war,\u201d says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner. He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors. They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China. In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds.\n\nIt comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high. \u201cI am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,\u201d says Mr Xiang who\u2019s in his 60s. \"Peace is what we want,\" he adds. A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble. They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\u2022 None Only one candidate is talking about China That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election. \u201cAlthough he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine\u2019s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,\u201d he said. Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. \u201cDonald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,\u201d says one. \u201cAbout Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.\u201d Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media.\n\nChina has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its \u201cArab brothers\u201d in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel. On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a \u201cconstructive role\u201d as he accused Washington of \u201cexploiting the situation for selfish gain\u201d. While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country\u2019s leaders.\n\u2022 None Listen to Laura Bicker discuss China/US on The Global Story\n\u2022 None Xi Jinping has economy worries. What do Chinese people think? But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan. \u201cI don\u2019t like Trump. I don\u2019t think there is a good future between the US and China \u2013 there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,\u201d says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out. He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want my son to go to the military,\u201d he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide. China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi Jinping has said \u201creunification is inevitable\u201d, vowing to retake it by force if necessary. The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its \"One China policy\" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a \u201ccommitment to security and prosperity for all nations\u201d. Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection. \u201cTaiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They\u2019re immensely wealthy,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defence.\u201d\n\nOne of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn. Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump. President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,\u201d says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people. Many of the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power, too. In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship. \u201cOur country is a very prosperous and powerful country,\u201d they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America. Taylor Swift is on their playlists, too.\n\nOthers like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day. As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation. Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. \u201cHarris\u2019s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it\u2019s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.\u201d The People\u2019s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that comprises most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges. Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800.\n\nXi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously. He said that, on dozens of occasions, security forces or a government ministry had prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US. On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials. Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China. \u201cWe may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,\u201d she says as she heads off to join her family.\n\nBetween now and the US election on 5 November, BBC correspondents in other parts of the world will be exploring the impact its outcome could have where they are, and what people around the globe make of this White House race",
    "What impact could Taylor Swift really have on the US election?\n\nNoel Drake, a 29-year-old who lives in Utah, said she felt \u201cvery bleak\u201d about politics before this year. During the 2020 presidential election, she felt disillusioned entirely. But Taylor Swift \u2013 and her fans \u2013 helped change her mind, she told me. \u201cWith this sense of community that I have established through interacting with other Swifties online, it has really changed the way I interact with politics this election cycle,\u201d she said. After Swift endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris a month ago, Ms Drake started following a fan-led campaign group called \u201cSwifties for Kamala\". The group is not officially affiliated with the Harris campaign, but does keep in regular touch with campaign staff. Since interacting with other like-minded Swifties, Ms Drake has decided to get more involved in local campaigning in her home state. The BBC has tracked down dozens of voters like Ms Drake, who say posts from Swift and her mega fans on social media have motivated them to go out and vote, or get involved in activism. But just because you\u2019re a fan of Swift doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to vote like her, I learned. For the latest episode of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Why Do You Hate Me USA, I\u2019ve been investigating how one pop-inclined meme enthusiast Irene Kim - the co-founder of Swifties for Kamala - found herself transformed from superfan to political strategist. Have any of the tactics used by her and her fellow activists actually worked?\n\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve messaged several accounts who like and comment on the Swifties for Kamala posts. Although some people were already Democrat supporters, others weren\u2019t so sure. Take 27-year-old Destiny from South Carolina, who doesn\u2019t want to share her surname. She said both her and her boyfriend are \u201cnot that political,\u201d but that the Swifties for Kamala posts have helped support her reasoning for voting for the Democrats this election. \u201cI really want a woman president who has similar values to me. This is my first election that has pushed me to vote for this reason,\u201d she said. Even her boyfriend, whom she described as \u201cmoderately conservative\u201d, has been swayed to vote for Harris, and she said it was in part inspired by her lobbying based on some Swifties for Kamala posts.\n\nIrene Kim is the co-founder of \"Swifties for Kamala\"\n\nPart of the appeal of a celebrity endorsement \u2013 and the political content generated by their fandoms \u2013 is that unlike paid-for adverts, this kind of user-generated content feels genuine. A study from Harvard Kennedy School that looked at the impact of celebrities when it comes to voter registration found their \u201cauthenticity\u201d can be key when motivating people to go out and vote. Its author, Ashley Spillane, told the BBC celebrities are among the \u201cmost well-positioned members of society\u201d when it comes to dealing with causes of voter apathy, such as \u201clack of information, lack of trust and lack of motivation\u201d. \u201cPeople know them from places outside of politics, which makes their involvement feel deeper and less self-interested,\u201d she said. Within 24 hours of Swift\u2019s Harris endorsement on Instagram, nearly 340,000 people had visited vote.gov, a registration website, using a custom link she created. While Harris has enjoyed endorsements from Swift, Beyonce and some other big-name celebrities, Trump is not without his fans either. Endorsements from Kid Rock, Elon Musk, John Voight and YouTubers the Nelk Boys may help him reach young men in the same way that Swift's endorsement has boosted Harris's profile with young women. Trump\u2019s own committed supporters online also operate a bit like a fandom. Endorsements can backfire, however, polls show. A Quinnipiac University poll from late September found that Swift\u2019s endorsement of Harris made 9% of respondents \u201cmore enthusiastic\u201d about her candidacy, while it made 13% \u201cless enthusiastic\u201d. It also looked at how Musk\u2019s endorsement affected respondents\u2019 views of Trump - 13% felt more enthusiastic, while 21% felt less. Ultimately, we won\u2019t know exactly what impact celebrities - and their fandoms - will have on this election until after November. In what looks to be a very closely fought election, it\u2019s these groups of online supporters who could motivate voters to head to the polls \u2013 especially in swing states where the winner may be decided by just thousands of votes. Ms Kim, the co-founder of Swifties for Kamala, told me the group is targeting people in swing states especially. Peggy Rowe is in Arizona, one of the most closely watched states in the election. She told me it was Harris\u2019s support for abortion rights that strengthened her to support for the vice-president. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about reproductive rights and social media has further confirmed my opinions,\u201d she said. While they're employing all the traditional political campaign methods, Swifties for Kamala has put a fan-specific twist on their efforts. Whenever they're at events, they give out friendship bracelets featuring political slogans like \u201cin my voting era\u201d. It's a nod to Swift's Eras tour, where fans have been trading Swift-themed friendship bracelets as a sign of being a true fan. Ms Kim said they\u2019d begun face-to-face campaigning a few weeks ago, and have been calling and texting followers directly. They aim to have 22 million direct voter contacts in total by Election Day. The Swifties for Kamala group has raised over $200,000 (\u00a3153,000) for Harris's campaign, as of the middle of October, she estimated.\n\nThere are some Swift fans, though, who have not been swayed. I\u2019ve spotted comments from several Republican and Trump supporters who have chosen their preferred politician over their allegiance to their favourite pop star, and sent dozens of them messages too. Bri, who lives in Massachusetts, says she chooses to vote Republican still because \u201cat the end of the day people need to do what\u2019s best for them\u201d. She told me she thinks Swift has such a devoted fan base, she should stay out of politics to be fair to all sides. Taylor Swift is \u201centitled to her own opinion,\u201d she said, but: \u201cShe is the only celebrity who has that amount of pull that she shouldn\u2019t mention politics during an election year.\" And although he didn\u2019t get her endorsement, Donald Trump supporters did try and harness Swift\u2019s fan electoral power, by making an AI-generated meme of Swift endorsing the former president. In fact, it was Trump sharing the meme on social media that prompted Swift to endorse Harris in the first place. Bri said she would \u201cnever not like someone over their political beliefs\u201d - including the fans who are part of Swifties for Kamala. But that doesn't mean all online conversations are friendly. Ms Kim told me that getting into heated online arguments is a bit of a \u201crite of passage\u201d for Swift's fandom. But the Swifties for Kamala campaign group now has guidelines to stop this happening, in part because they want to win over voters who don\u2019t share the same views. \u201cI think it\u2019s always good to try to bridge the gap,\u201d she said.

    "Sleep Token have kept their identities secret by wearing masks on stage\n\nWhen it comes to your favourite music artists, chances are you probably know a lot about their lives. But there is an air of mystery around one of the headline acts for next year's Download festival. British metal group Sleep Token will be topping the bill in Leicestershire, along with Green Day and Korn.\n\nIt is the first time any of the three headliners have been the main acts at the rock gathering. Sleep Token - who formed in 2016 - are known for performing in masks to keep their identities hidden, and have created a buzz in particular. A search online gives no easy answers about them, with various theories floating around some of their identities - often citing \"research and analysis\". \"I think it's a big part of the attraction because no-one knows who they are,\" says fan Devon, from Plymouth. \"It gives a lot of people a chance to see them. I've always wanted to see them and Download's just an amazing opportunity.\"\n\nDevon, 25, tells BBC Newsbeat \"the massive bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Slipknot\" often take the headline slot, and the change is good. \"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love those bands, but it's nice to have something new for once.\" There has been some criticism about not having some of those traditional acts, but Devon feels it's a case of \"people don't like seeing new stuff coming out\".\n\nOn their website, Sleep Token encourage fans to \"gather in Worship\" at their shows\n\nGareth, from Cardiff, has been a fan of Sleep Token for five years and is excited to see them. He feels the group \"have moments of real sombreness\" mixed with the heavy metal. \"I guess when they started, they were supporting the headliners [at the time],\" Gareth, 22, says. \"It's so good to see the evolution of a band from playing in small venues to them now having millions of monthly listeners, and also to headline what is probably the biggest metal festival in the UK.\"\n\nOther acts due to perform include McFly, Bullet For My Valentine, Don Broco, Sex Pistols, Alien Ant Farm, Spiritbox, Poppy and CKY. Alyx Holcombe, presenter of BBC Introducing Rock on Radio 1, describes the new line-up as \"refreshing\". \"It feels like we are going in the right direction for rock music,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"The music is like something that I don't think anyone has really ever heard before. It's quite a new sound.\" And she's a fan of the \"clever\" mystery masks because it \"creates intrigue\". \"I think it adds a layer of mystery and curiosity as to why are all these people in masks. \"I want to know who is creating this amazing music, and it creates a mass fandom,\" she says.\n\nHeadlining Download brings Sleep Token into the \"big leagues\" of rock, Alyx says. \"I think it's a statement that Download have put out. \"Like actually, Sleep Token are as good as all these other bands, and you should get on board with them. \"It would be a dream for anyone, and to be next to Green Day and Korn, I know they're absolutely stoked about this,\" she says. Download festival is due to take place at Donington Park, Leicestershire, between 13 and 15 June.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

A total of 33 people have been rescued so far but seven were still missing as of Tuesday evening. The victims' identities have not yet been disclosed by authorities. The BBC understands two of the missing are British nationals. The four-deck modern vessel had been carrying 31 passengers and 13 crew when it is understood to have been hit by a large wave near Marsa Alam, causing it to capsize. The boat sent distress calls at 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT), local authorities said.\n\nMedics wait near the scene as search efforts continue\n\nThe vessel sank within five to seven minutes, according to Red Sea governor Maj-Gen Amr Hanafi. He said some people had been unable to escape from their cabins. A total of 28 people were rescued by military personnel and a passing tourist boat in the hours after the vessel capsized. The governor had earlier said other survivors were found in the Wadi el-Gemal area, south of Marsa Alam. The 44m (144ft) Sea Story yacht had departed a port near Marsa Alam on Sunday for a five-day diving trip that was supposed to finish further north at the town of Hurghada. It is believed to have been hit by rough winds overnight on Sunday. The Egyptian Meteorological Authority warned of high waves on the Red Sea and advised against maritime activity on Sunday and Monday. Wind speeds were between 37-43 mph (60-70 kmph) and wave heights were three to four metres (10-13ft) high.\n\nAccording to the local council in Marsa Alam, the crew of the Sea Story are Egyptian while the tourists on board were from Belgium, Britain, China, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the US. Among the missing are two Polish tourists and one from Finland, according to those nations' foreign ministries. A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said they were providing \"support to a number of British nationals and their families following an incident in Egypt\". The Chinese embassy in Egypt said two of its nationals were \"in good health\" after being rescued.\n\nMarsa Alam is a popular destination for tourists on Egypt\u2019s southern Red Sea coast. It is surrounded by diving spots, including renowned coral reefs. The Red Sea governorate said the boat was owned by an Egyptian national, and had received a one-year validity certificate in March 2024 when it was inspected by maritime safety. Hanafi said there were no technical faults at the time of the incident. He also visited Marsa Alam to see the people rescued, and said they were all in good health, and no-one had needed admission to hospital. The passengers are being taken to a tourist hotel in the area, he added. The BBC has contacted Sea Story's Egypt-based owner and operator, Dive Pro Liveaboard. Its website says the vessel was built in 2022, external. It has four decks and 18 cabins that can accommodate up to 36 passengers. Last year, three Britons died off the coast of Marsa Alam after their dive boat caught fire.\n\nThe Sea Story reportedly departed a port near Marsa Alam, Egypt, on Sunday",
    "Roblox to ban young children from messaging others\n\nRoblox has announced it will block under-13s from messaging others on the online gaming platform as part of new efforts to safeguard children. Child users will not be able to send direct messages within games by default unless a verified parent or guardian gives them permission. Parents will also be able to view and manage their child's account, including seeing their list of online friends, and setting daily limits on their play time. Roblox is the most popular gaming platform for eight to 12 year olds in the UK, according to Ofcom research, but it has been urged to make its experiences safer for children.\n\nThe company said it would begin rolling out the changes from Monday, and they will be fully implemented by the end of March 2025. It means young children will still be able to access public conversations seen by everyone in games - so they can still talk to their friends - but cannot have private conversations without parental consent. Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, said the game is played by 88 million people each day, and over 10% of its total employees - equating to thousands of people - work on the platform's safety features. \"As our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it,\" he said. Besides banning children from sending direct messages (DMs) across the platform, it will give parents more ways to easily see and manage their child's activity.\n\nThe platform says parents will be able to more easily manage controls such as what content their child sees and when they can send direct messages\n\nParents and guardians must verify their identity and age with a form of government-issued ID or a credit card in order to access parental permissions for their child, via their own linked account. But Mr Kaufman acknowledged identity verification is a challenge being faced by a lot of tech companies, and called on parents to make sure a child has the correct age on their account. \"Our goal is to keep all users safe, no matter what age they are,\" he said. \"We encourage parents to be working with their kids to create accounts and hopefully ensure that their kids are using their accurate age when they sign up.\" Richard Collard, associate head of policy for child safety online at UK children's charity the NSPCC, called the changes \u201ca positive step in the right direction\". But he said they need to be supported by effective ways of checking and verifying user age in order to \"translate into safer experiences for children\". \"Roblox must make this a priority to robustly tackle the harm taking place on their site and protect young children,\" he added.\n\nRoblox also announced it planned to simplify descriptions for content on the platform. It is replacing age recommendations for certain games and experiences to \"content labels\" that simply outline the nature of the game. It said this meant parents could make decisions based on the maturity of their child, rather than their age. These range from \"minimal\", potentially including occasional mild violence or fear, to \"restricted\" - potentially containing more mature content such as strong violence, language or lots of realistic blood. By default, Roblox users under the age of nine will only be able to access \"minimal\" or \"mild\" experiences - but parents can allow them to play \"moderate\" games by giving consent. But users cannot access \"restricted\" games until they are at least 17-years-old and have used the platform's tools to verify their age. It follows an announcement in November that Roblox would be barring under-13s from \"social hangouts\", where players can communicate with each other using text or voice messages, from Monday. It also told developers that from 3 December, Roblox game creators would need to specify whether their games are suitable for children and block games for under-13s that do not provide this information. The changes come as platforms accessed and used by children in the UK prepare to meet new rules around illegal and harmful material on their platforms under the Online Safety Act. Ofcom, the UK watchdog enforcing the law, has warned that companies will face punishments if they fail to keep children safe on their platforms. It will publish its codes of practice for companies to abide by in December.",
    "Established in 1946, Be\u2019eri is one of 11 Jewish communities in this region set up before the creation of the state of Israel. It was known for its left-leaning views, and many of its residents believed in, and advocated for, peace with the Palestinians.\n\nAfter the attacks, many residents were moved into a hotel by the Dead Sea - the David Hotel - some 90 minutes' drive away.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, I witnessed their trauma.\n\nShell-shocked residents gathered in the lobby and other communal areas, as they tried to make sense of what had happened, and who they had lost, in hushed conversations. Some children clung to their parents as they spoke.\n\nStill now, they say, the conversations have not moved on.\n\n\"Every person I speak to from Be'eri - it always goes back to this day. Every conversation is going back to dealing with it and the effects after it. We are always talking about it again and again and again,\" says Shir Guttentag.\n\nLike her friend Dafna, Shir was holed up that day in her safe room, attempting to reassure terrified neighbours on the WhatsApp group as Hamas gunmen stormed through the kibbutz, shooting residents and setting homes on fire.\n\nShir twice dismantled the barricade of furniture she had made against her front door to let neighbours in to hide. She told her children, \"it's OK, it's going to be OK\" as they waited to be rescued.\n\nWhen they were eventually escorted to safety, she looked down at the ground, not wanting to see the remains of her community.\n\nIn the coming months at the Dead Sea hotel, Shir says she struggled as people began to leave - some to homes elsewhere in the country or to stay with families, others seeking to escape their memories by heading abroad.\n\nEach departure was like \"another break-up, another goodbye\", she says.\n\nIt is no longer unusual to see someone who is crying or looking sad among Be'eri's grieving residents.\n\n\"In normal days it would have been like, 'What happened? Are you OK?' Nowadays everyone can cry and no-one asks him why,\u201d Shir says.\n\nShir and her daughters, along with hundreds of other Be'eri survivors, have now moved to new, identical prefabricated homes, paid for by the Israeli government, on an expanse of barren land at another kibbutz, Hatzerim - about 40-minutes drive from Be'eri.\n\nI was there on moving day.",
    "Dead child was undiscovered in garden for years\n\nTai and Naiyahmi Yasharahyalah are accused of allowing or causing the death of their three-year-old son, Abiyah\n\nA couple accused of child cruelty towards their son, who was found buried in a back garden, denied his existence to the authorities, a court has heard. Tai and Naiyahmi Yasharahyalah, aged 42 and 43, are accused of causing or allowing the death of their three-year-old son, Abiyah Yasharahyalah. He was found in a back garden in Handsworth, Birmingham, in December 2022. When he was exhumed, he was found to have been \"severely malnourished\", with broken bones, rickets, anaemia, dental disease, and stunted growth.\n\nThe prosecution suggested that Abiyah died between December 2019 and January 2020 and would have been approximately three years and nine months old. The couple, who are also accused of perverting the course of justice, are standing trial at Coventry Crown Court. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin told the court that the pair had prioritised their cultural practices and beliefs over their son's welfare, \"with disastrous consequences\". The court heard the couple did not believe in western medicine and preferred traditional practices, such as herbs and superstition. They had a strict vegan diet and lived increasingly unconventionally. Witness statements read to the court said the couple had rejected UK sovereignty and citizenship, and were living off-grid. Multiple witnesses also expressed concern about the couple's health and strength, saying they had been seen out in public struggling to walk.\n\nDetectives searching a property on Clarence Road in Handsworth in December 2022\n\nAbiyah's existence came to light when the authorities found photos and videos of him on his father's social media accounts while they were investigating other matters. In a later meeting with officials, Mrs Yasharahyalah was confronted with pictures of Abiyah on social media and was asked about them. She was told: \"I can freely search and I believe that I've found photos of you and Tai from some time ago with a child.\" Mrs Yasharahyalah said: \"I've got no information to give you, so it's irrelevant right now.\"\n\nAbiyah is believed to have been buried in the garden from January 2020 to December 2022\n\nIn an email sent to her husband after Mrs Yasharahyalah was asked about the photos, she said: \"Let him locate him lol.\" Another message said: \"No one will micromanage our lives, I do not owe anyone an explanation, an indigenous family.\" An email from that day also said that they should say that Abiyah was \"one of the victims of the Covid agenda\".\n\nNot long after this, the couple admitted Abiyah was dead and they were arrested on the same day. Between 12 and 15 December, Abiyah's body was exhumed from a garden on Clarence Road in Handsworth, from which the couple had been evicted earlier that year. They then went to live in a shipping container in Glastonbury, before moving into a caravan when they were asked to leave. Mr Yasharahyalah said they had not registered Abiyah's birth because it was not part of their culture and said they were entitled to a private burial.\n\nBoth defendants deny neglect, causing or allowing the death of a child and perverting the course of justice.\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Birmingham and the Black Country",
    "Men who drugged, raped and murdered young father jailed for life\n\nCalum Simpson died from intoxication caused by drugs and alcohol\n\nTwo men who drugged, raped and murdered a young father-of-four have been jailed for life. Dylan Brister and Cameron Allan spiked Calum Simpson\u2019s drink with Etizolam and bound his wrists with rope at a flat in Methil, Fife, before filming their \"depraved\" attack on a mobile phone. Mr Simpson, 24, whose youngest child was born just 11 days previously, later died from intoxication caused by the combination of the class C drug and alcohol. Brister, 28, who also admitted attacking two police officers, was told he will serve a minimum of 23 years, while Allan, 21, received a 19-year sentence after both were earlier found guilty of sexual assault, rape and murder.\n\nSentencing at the High Court in Dundee, judge Lord Harrower told the pair they had caused \"terrible devastation\u201d to Mr Simpson\u2019s family. He said: \"There are so many milestones in the children\u2019s lives that their father will no longer be able to share for reasons that cannot adequately be explained to them. \"No sentence of this court can alleviate the family\u2019s grief and anguish.\"\n\nCameron Allan was jailed for 19 years for his part in the rape and murder\n\nThe court heard the pair had been attempting to recruit a man to make up a threesome using the dating app Grindr, but their efforts had failed. Mr Simpson had been with a friend before accompanying him to the flat on 3 November 2021. His friend had later departed, leaving Mr Simpson alone with Brister and Allan. Brister, who had won more than \u00a320,000 gambling, had purchased 1,000 tablets of Etizolam, also known as \"street valium,\" which he claimed he thought were diazepam. The court was told the sedative was up to 10 times stronger than regular valium. Brister had previously spiked the drink of one woman and placed tablets in the mouth of another without her consent.\n\nMr Simpson was rendered unconscious by the combination of the tablets and alcohol. Allan claimed Mr Simpson had been conscious and consenting when he was tied up by the pair, but acknowledged they had continued their attack after he \u201cpassed out\u201d. The pair filmed several videos of their assault on a mobile phone, which were later deleted but officers from Police Scotland\u2019s specialist cybercrime unit were able to retrieve the footage. During the earlier trial, Brister told the court: \"I won't dispute the fact that Calum passed out and we carried on. I didn't spike that boy, but yes, I gave him drugs. \"We raped him and continued to have sex. It is what it is, disgusting. It should never have happened. I am not going to make excuses.\" Allan, meanwhile, said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d that the videos were taken, but said he \"did not know he was doing something wrong\u201d at the time. After their attack, the pair left Mr Simpson unconscious before going to sleep. In the morning they found him cold and rigid. However, before contacting the emergency services, the pair first concealed what remained of their drugs in a safe and handed it to a neighbour. Ambulance personnel were called at 12:03 and confirmed Mr Simpson had died.\n\nDuring the trial, Brister said he suffered from complex post-traumatic stress disorder and a personality disorder, and received anti-psychotic medication. Allan said he was diagnosed with an attachment disorder after watching his mother die in a car accident when he was three. In addition to their sentences, both men were placed on the sex offenders\u2019 register indefinitely. During sentencing, Lord Harrower said: \"Whether or not you intended to kill Calum Simpson, you each revealed yourselves to be completely indifferent as to whether he lived or died. \"As a result, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that you displayed such a degree of wicked recklessness that what you did amounted to murder.\" Lord Harrower excluded the jury from further service for life due to the evidence seen. Moira Orr, who leads on homicide and major crime for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), said: \"The depraved and predatory actions of Dylan Brister and Cameron Allan have robbed a family of their loving son, father, partner, nephew and grandson. \u201cThey showed a blatant disregard for their victim\u2019s safety and life by spiking his drink with drugs before subjecting him to the most harrowing sexual abuse.\"",
    "'Huge moment' as Bollywood music comes to Strictly\n\nStrictly Come Dancing contestant Punam Krishan has said it is a \"huge moment\" as she and her professional dance partner brought Bollywood music to the ballroom. The TV doctor and Gorka M\u00e1rquez danced to Bole Chudiyan from 2001 hit film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham on Saturday night. It is the first time in the show's 20-year history that a competing couple have performed to a traditional Bollywood song. \"I never saw Indian girls dancing on mainstream television, so to be doing now, an Indian dance, on a platform like Strictly, it's huge,\" the 41-year-old said.\n\n\"I am such a proud Scottish Indian girl,\" Krishan, whose parents moved from the Punjab to Glasgow in the 1970s, added. \"In this couple's choice, I really just want to bring my culture and my heritage to the forefront.\"\n\nThe judges were full of praise for the dance, with three of them awarding the pair eight, and one scoring them nine. \"I don't profess to be any authority, darling, on this genre,\" said Craig Revel Horwood. \"But what I can see, it was absolutely incredible.\" \"That really moved me,\" added Motsi Mabuse. \"I know so many people are watching you right now and feeling so proud to see this on Strictly Come Dancing.\"\n\nAhead of the dance, Krishan told Strictly spin-off show, It Takes Two that she hoped her children would feel \"really proud\", seeing her performing the couple's choice routine to a Bollywood song. \"But [it's] also for South Asians or any child that just wants to see something a bit different or just to feel included,\" she added. \"Representation matters, so for me this is a huge moment.\" Strictly has dabbled with Indian music before, including with two professional dances in a Bollywood style. Singer Will Young also performed a salsa to Jai Ho from Slumdog Millionaire in 2016 - although that film was by Danny Boyle, and not Bollywood. But never before has India's massive film industry been represented by one of the couples. Released in 2001, Bole Chudiyan is remembered for being the signature sound of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Last week, it was voted the UK's favourite noughties Bollywood tune. The family drama movie featured some of Bollywood's biggest names such as Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Hrithik Roshan. \"It's basically the Love Actually of Bollywood,\" Krishan said of the film. \"It's a proper comfort movie.\" She added that her dance partner M\u00e1rquez had been singing the song all week. \"You've really taken on Indian culture, you've embraced it all,\" she told him.\n\nNick Knowles has been dancing in the show with his partner Luba Mushtuk\n\nSaturday night's movie week also saw JLS member JB Gill and dancer Amy Dowden perform the American smooth to Pure Imagination from Wonka, while comedian Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell jived to the Wayne's World Theme. But Nick Knowles was missing from the show, after being forced to pull out due to an injury. The DIY SOS presenter and his partner Luba Mushtuk were due to perform the Charleston to Rain on the Roof from the film Paddington 2. A post on Strictly's Instagram page, external said that Knowles, 62, had sustained an injury during rehearsals and would not dance this weekend. \"As per the rules of the competition, Nick and Luba will receive a bye through to next week when he is hopefully able to dance again. \"Everyone at Strictly Come Dancing wishes Nick a speedy recovery.\" No further details about the injury have been disclosed.",

Officers were called to Livery Street, in central Birmingham, during the early hours of Friday after a car hit pedestrians near the Tunnel Club. A 22-year-old man was arrested on Saturday and taken into custody for questioning, West Midlands Police said. Another man, arrested earlier on suspicion of affray, was in hospital, police said. \u201cAt this stage, we believe this to have been an isolated and deliberate attack linked to an earlier incident inside the nightclub,\u201d said Det Ch Insp Dave Sproson from Birmingham Police.\n\nA number of people were injured when a car was driven at a group outside the nightclub with the car then being driven away from the scene.

The Northern Irishman finished two strokes ahead of Hojgaard on 15 under at Jumeirah Golf Estates after a three-under-par 69 in his final round. McIlroy, 35, was confirmed as the Race to Dubai winner midway through his round when nearest challenger Thriston Lawrence - who had needed to win the tournament to have any chance of clinching the overall title - finished at one under. It is the third year in succession that McIlroy has topped the tour's season rankings and his sixth title overall - matching Seve Ballesteros' record. \"Everyone knows what Seve means to European golf and Ryder Cup players,\" an emotional McIlroy told Sky Sports. \"The European Ryder Cup locker room, all we have are quotes from Seve. We had a changing room with Seve's shirt from '95, the last Ryder Cup he played. \"He means so much to European golf and for me to be mentioned in the same breath, I'm very proud.\" Sharing a three-way lead at the start of the final round, McIlroy put two shots between himself and Hojgaard with four birdies in his first five holes. But bogeys on the ninth and 13th allowed the Dane to draw level with four holes remaining. Just as Hojgaard was piling on the pressure, McIlroy produced a stunning approach shot on the 16th to tee up a birdie putt. It was precisely the type of risky, aggressive play that has worked against McIlroy in the past but it moved him one stroke clear on this occasion with two holes left. Hojgaard was forced to be aggressive in reply, but the Dane narrowly missed a birdie putt on the 18th - relieving the pressure on McIlroy who holed his own birdie attempt to seal the win.\n\nDespite his success this season, McIlroy failed to end his decade-long wait for another major. The 35-year-old collapsed during his final round of June's US Open, eventually losing by one stroke to Bryson DeChambeau. \"I've been through a lot this year, professionally, personally and it feels like the fitting end to 2024,\" said McIlroy. \"I've persevered this year a lot, had close calls, wasn't able to get it done, so to be able to get over the line... I'm really pleased with the way I finished and thankfully I hung on on a tough day and got the job done.\" McIlroy will be joined on the PGA Tour next year by countryman Tom McKibbin.

    "Actress 'dazzles' as woman who is always miserable in Mike Leigh film\n\nActress Marianne Jean-Baptiste and director Mike Leigh have reunited for a hard-hitting new film, nearly three decades after they first worked together. Hard Truths, about an irritable woman whose constant misery puts severe strain on those around her, premiered at the London Film Festival on Monday evening. Leigh and Jean-Baptiste previously collaborated on 1996's Secrets & Lies - which scored Oscar nominations for best picture as well as best director and best supporting actress respectively. Their critically acclaimed new film, which Leigh revealed was turned down by other film festivals, could see them both in the Academy Awards race once again.\n\nHard Truths centres on Pansy, a woman who seems constantly angry at the world, regularly getting into scrapes with everyone from shop assistants to her dentist. Her attitude to life has a detrimental effect on her husband, son and sister in particular, characters who clearly love her, but can only take so much. The film follows Pansy as she navigates various everyday situations with her bad-tempered approach. On Mother's Day, things come to a head as their families gather together to mark the occasion. Jean-Baptiste delivers a stunning central performance in the lead role - she is highly watchable despite playing such a grumpy character. The actress joined Leigh and her co-stars at the film's UK premiere at London's Royal Festival Hall on Monday.\n\nMike Leigh has previously directed Peterloo, Vera Drake and Another Year\n\nPansy's sister Chantelle has a healthy relationship with her two children, including Aleisha (played by Sophia Brown)\n\nPansy's other niece, Kayla, is played by Ani Nelson\n\nPuzzlingly, before receiving its world premiere in Toronto last month, Leigh confirmed the film was rejected by three major film festivals, external - Venice, Cannes and Telluride. \"It\u2019s hard to know what to feel about Cannes,\" Leigh told the Associated Press of the French festival where he had previously won the top prize. \"If you look at the line-up, you think, maybe you can see that they wanted glitz and glamour. \"You think, whatever. I mean, if nobody wanted it at all... then I\u2019d start to twitch.\" Reviews from the festivals where the film has played have been hugely positive, with Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson saying, external it's \"a pleasure seeing the pair reunited for another piercing character study\" in a \"dazzlingly complex, bracing work\". \"Leigh\u2019s films can feel shaggy and unstructured on first viewing,\" added Variety's Peter Debruge., external \"Hard Truths is no different, but there\u2019s profound poetry in every scene.\" Screen Rant's Patrice Witherspoon noted:, external \"Inherently, witnessing a woman propel insults at people is humorous, but sadness layers the script, making it deeply moving.\" While the film isn't an easy watch, she added, \"thanks to a stunning lead performance from Jean-Baptiste and an ending that doesn\u2019t take the easy way out, it is a must-watch\". \"The beauty of Hard Truths,\" reflected Next Best Picture's Nadia Dalimonte,, external \"is its incredible embrace of Pansy in all her complexities\".\n\nThe film reaches its climax as the family gathers together to celebrate Mother's Day\n\nTonally, the film feels like vintage Mike Leigh - seemingly focused on the everyday and the mundane, yet packed with meaning. All the classic Leigh traits are here, down to the gentle woodwind instruments which provide the score. But the film's quiet, unflashy style allows the characters to breathe in a way that arguably leaves a much bigger impact on the viewer. The dialogue spoken by the overwhelmingly black cast feels authentic, perhaps suspiciously so for a film which a 81-year-old white man is credited with writing. But in fact, Leigh's sole screenplay credit is deceptive. After writing the core plot and the basic dialogue, the director works with his cast via rehearsals and improvisation to shape the characters' words in ways that feel authentic for them. \"No doubt there will be some debate over Leigh\u2019s qualifications to portray this particular milieu, a middle-class and upper working-class sector of London\u2019s Afro-Caribbean community,\" noted Screen Daily's Jonathan Romney in his review., external \"But bearing in mind his famous collaborative working methods, it is clear just how much the cast have contributed to the film\u2019s cultural detail. \"While the dramatic premise is hardly specific to a black environment, the references and linguistic patterns feel bang-on \u2013 notably Pansy\u2019s shifting between Cockney and Caribbean inflections.\" Hard Truths will be released in the UK in January.",
    "Rare typed copy of The Little Prince to go on sale for $1.25m\n\nA rare typescript of children's story The Little Prince, one of the most translated books ever published, is set to go on sale for $1.25m (\u00a3963,313). The typescript - a typed copy of a text - was produced in New York by its author, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, while in exile from Nazi-occupied France in the 1940s, and is one of three known to be in existence. The copy contains handwritten notes and sketches by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. It will go on sale at the Abu Dhabi Art Festival in the United Arab Emirates in November. Having the typed manuscript \"is an extremely rare event\", said Sammy Jay, senior literature specialist from the typescript's seller Peter Harrington Rare Books.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote Le Petit Prince, in the original French, for children while living in exile in New York during World War Two. It was published in 1943. He was an experienced aviator and, after writing the book, he returned to Europe on a reconnaissance mission for the Free French air force fighting Nazi Germany. He disappeared on his last mission while over the Mediterranean, and it is unknown how exactly his plane went down. The famous work of fiction is about a pilot stranded in a desert who meets a small boy called the Little Prince who is visiting Earth. Since its publication, The Little Prince has gone on to sell millions of copies around the world.\n\nThe typescript has two sketches of the Little Prince with it\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's original handwritten manuscript is in New York. Two other typescripts are known to exist, one in France's national library and another in the Harry Ransom Center in Texas. Mr Jay told the BBC that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry gave those two typescripts to friends before his disappearance, but the third one \"wasn't inscribed or given to someone\". The third was in a private collection in France \"for decades\" and is the only copy that has come up to be sold to the public, he said, adding that it is \"astounding\" to have it. \"It's very exciting because the quest [for me] is always to find something more and more amazing...I don't know how I'm going to beat it,\" Mr Jay said. Peter Harrington Rare Books has possessed the typescript since the start of 2024 and has been cataloguing and conducting research on it, as well as making it ready for sale. The cover shows evidence of stubbed-out cigarettes and the typescript contains Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwritten notes, annotations, and edits on its pages. It also features what has been thought to be the first written appearance of one of the story's most famous lines: \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; the essential is invisible to the eye.\" This typescript is \"much more intimate\" than the other two, Mr Jay said, highlighting notes and \"doodles\" the author made on it. Two sketches of the Little Prince accompany the artefact, one of which was a preliminary sketch for the book's final illustration, according to Peter Harrington Rare Books. The Little Prince is part of a \"global literary heritage\" as one of the most translated books in the world, Mr Jay said. He said there was the possibility a museum or library outside of Europe could buy the typescript in November, which could show a \"recognition of its global status\".\n\u2022 None 'I found the resting place of the Little Prince' Video, 00:04:10'I found the resting place of the Little Prince'",

In 2018, Rosie-May and her family were at a friend's house to watch the display but a multi-box flare shot at Rosie-May's neck, setting her on fire. Mum Ellie Mason, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, said the 999 handler told them to put her daughter in a bath of cold water. A quick response from the emergency services was key for Rosie-May, but fire and police unions say firefighters being attacked is slowing response times and putting lives at risk.\n\nMs Mason told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that when Rosie-May caught on fire her first instinct was to pick her up and try to pat her down \"in blind panic because I didn't know what to do\". She said she \"wouldn't have known\" to put her daughter in a cold bath: \"My instinct was to cover [the burn] with cling film.\" Rosie-May was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital before being transferred to a specialist burns unit at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. She needed a chemical bath and skin grafts and spent five weeks in hospital after the incident.\n\nIt has been six years since Rosie-May was hit by the flare\n\nA quick response from the emergency services was key for Rosie-May, but fire and police unions say firefighters being attacked is slowing response times. Last Bonfire Night, police control centres in Wales took over 1,500 calls for help. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) Wales said firefighters have increasingly been attacked with rocks and fireworks, as well as abusive comments over the past decade. Gareth Tovey, from FBU Wales, said: \"The worst thing is, it means that we need to potentially withdraw from that situation and we have to remember we were only ever there to make sure people are safe.\" He added that groups of youths would often hold their phones up and film on occasions which could really affect firefighters. While Bonfire Night is the busiest night of the year for firefighters, Mr Tovey said these attacks were not limited to 5 November. \"We certainly see these attacks on crews throughout the year, at different holiday events and through different school holidays.\" Home Office figures recorded a 60% increase in attacks across the UK compared to 10 years ago.\n\nThe emergency services say they still want people to enjoy Bonfire night\n\nSteven Davies, a group manager at Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said fire engines were equipped with CCTV and anyone spotted throwing fireworks would be prosecuted. He also warned people thinking of having their own bonfires not to have them too close to their or anyone else's home, or they would face having them put out by fire crews. \"We will work with the police and local authorities to monitor any bonfires which might be too big or too close to properties,\" he added.\n\nSpecial PC Ben Johns, of South Wales Police said officers were also faced with abuse on Bonfire Night and extra patrols would be put on to deal with anti-social behaviour. While patrolling on Halloween, Special PC Johns was out with a team that was attacked by a group who threw fireworks and eggs at the police van. \"I think it's something as police officers we shouldn't be subject to but we are quite resilient, if you were a member of the public and that was happening it would be incredibly scary,\" he said. He said the van was taken out of service to check it was safe, which meant the team could not respond to 999 calls. Special PC Johns said he wanted people to enjoy Bonfire Night safely but the date always sparked an increase in anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile, officers in Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taf, have been given extra powers to deal with anti-social behaviour following an \"unsafe\" bonfire in Nant-Y-Fedw, said South Wales Police. A dispersal order, covering the surrounding area, will apply to those aged 10 years and over and will be in place for 48 hours from 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. South Wales Police added that a dispersal order has also been applied in Butetown and Grangetown. The order has been put in place from 18:00 on 4 November until 18:00 on 6 November.\n\nThe Welsh government said it condemns \"in the strongest terms attacks on members of the emergency services at any time of the year\". \"Firefighters should be able to serve the public without fear of being attacked while on duty,\" it added.",

    "This year set to be first to breach 1.5C global warming limit\n\nThis summer, India experienced its longest ever recorded heatwave according to officials\n\nIt is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service. Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark. These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.\n\n\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.\n\nGlobal temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set. In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service. \"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels. The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year. \"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.\n\nThis would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data. This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change. If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability. But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies. The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern. Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere. This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since. Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.\n\nMany scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain. \"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set. \"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins. \"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"\n\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "How Rodgers earned 'one of his best results' in Atalanta draw\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFormer Celtic manager Neil Lennon says the team's gutsy goalless Champions League draw at Atalanta delivered \"one of the best results of Brendan Rodgers' career\". Following a humiliating 7-1 defeat by Borussia Dortmund, pressure was on Rodgers to show he could orchestrate a resolute defensive display away to the Europa League holders. And the 51-year-old's tactical tweaks paid off as the Scottish champions held firm to record just a second ever away clean sheet in the competition. Speaking on TNT Sports, Lennon said: \"They have now proven they can go away from home and dig out a result.\" Meanwhile, Celtic boss Rodgers hailed his team's mental resilience to respond by shutting out the Serie A's top scorers. \"The concentration in the game was superb,\" he said. \"The players showed great courage. I never doubted them and their mentality. \"I think if you look at our opening three games, I'm so, so happy to have four points. That's equal with what we had last year, so with five games to go hopefully we can add to that.\"\n\nRodgers faced intense criticism in the aftermath of the Dortmund mauling and a debate about whether he was willing to adapt dominated the build-up to Wednesday's game. Based on his pre-match comments, there was little to suggest he would change his European approach, which he has passionately backed. \"My coaching has always been aggressive. And until the day I finish, it will be aggressive,\" he said on Tuesday. Post-match in Bergamo, he joked that he was unsure whether the performance \"was pragmatic enough for some people\". Celtic certainly had to be aggressive in their defensive work, but it was lacking from their attacking display. In no way is that a criticism, though, as the Glasgow side did what they had to do to get a priceless point by turning the dial down on their usual relentless forward play - and the numbers back that up. In comparison to the chastening 7-1 defeat in Dortmund, Celtic had less of the ball (47% down to 34%), fewer shots (nine to four) and half as many touches in the opposition box (12 to six). The numbers in both games also show the quirks of stats, given Atalanta failed to score with an expected goals (xG) tally of 2.33, while Dortmund smashed in seven with an xG of 2.64. \"We had to learn from the Dortmund game and defend for our lives,\" Celtic goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel told TNT Sports. \"To come here and get a point is a good point. We took a more practical approach in this one and took fewer chances in our build-up due to their man-to-man system.\"\n\nCeltic's average positions map at Atalanta (left) shows a far more compact shape in comparison to the heavy Dortmund defeat (right)\n\nThe oddity of the xG figures at Atalanta and Dortmund perhaps highlight just how devastating the Bundesliga side's finishing was in Germany, but Schmeichel avoided his goal being breached in Bergamo by pulling off six saves. The four-man defence in front of the Denmark goalkeeper will rightly be at the forefront of the plaudits, though, particularly centre-back pairing Liam Scales and Auston Trusty. In the absence of first pick Cameron Carter-Vickers, Scales and Trusty defended resolutely by making 24 clearances between them. \"Scales and Trusty were outstanding,\" former Scotland forward James McFadden said on BBC Sportsound. \"The two of them didn't panic. Atalanta asked a lot of questions and Celtic had the answers.\" Full-backs Alistair Johnston and Alex Valle, continuing in the place of injured Greg Taylor, also impressed. Meanwhile, Adam Idah gave the team more of a focal point at the other end and Reo Hatate provided more energy and industry in midfield. With arguably their two toughest Champions League games out of the way, Celtic can now look forward to back-to-back home matches against RB Leipzig and Club Brugge with four points already on the board. \"So many moments in that game, it felt like the pressure was similar to the Dortmund match,\" former Celtic goalkeeper Joe Hart said on TNT Sports. \"Dortmund got out of control very quickly, but Celtic could deal in the chaos, win the big headers, get a little bit of luck, and some big saves from Schmeichel. \"Once it got through to 70 minutes it felt like Atalanta ran out of ideas. Celtic as a complete squad, brilliant effort.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

    "New skin research could help slow signs of ageing\n\nBy understanding how skin develops researchers hope to slow the signs of aging\n\nResearchers have made a scientific discovery that in time could be used to slow the signs of ageing. A team has discovered how the human body creates skin from a stem cell, and even reproduced small amounts of skin in a lab. The research is part of a study to understand how every part of the human body is created, one cell at a time. As well as combatting ageing, the findings could also be used to produce artificial skin for transplantation and prevent scarring. The Human Cell Atlas project is one of the most ambitious research programmes in biology. It is international but centred at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge. One of the project's leaders, Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, said it would help scientists treat diseases more effectively, but also find new ways of keeping us healthier for longer, and perhaps even keep us younger-looking. \u201cIf we can manipulate the skin and prevent ageing we will have fewer wrinkles,\" said Prof Haniffa of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. \"If we can understand how cells change from their initial development to ageing in adulthood you can then try and say, 'How do I rejuvenate organs, make the heart younger, how do I make the skin younger?'\u201d\n\nThat vision is some way off but researchers are making progress, most recently in their understanding of how skin cells develop in the foetus during the early development stage of human life. When an egg is first fertilised human cells are all the same. But after three weeks, specific genes inside these so-called \"stem cells\" switch on, passing along instructions on how to specialise and clump together to form the various bits of the body. Researchers have identified which genes are turned on at what times and in which locations to form the body's largest organ, skin. Under the microscope and treated with chemicals they look like tiny fairy lights. Genes that turn orange form the skin\u2019s surface. Others in yellow determine its colour and there are many others which form the other structures that grow hair, enable us to sweat and protect us from the outside world.\n\nA developing human foot, on which dots of different colours are genes building bone, muscle and cartilage\n\nThe researchers have essentially obtained the instruction set to create human skin and published them in the journal Nature. Being able to read these instructions opens up exciting possibilities. Scientists already know, for example, that foetal skin heals with no scarring. The new instruction set contains details of how this happens, and one research area could be to see if this could be replicated in adult skin, possibly for use in surgical procedures. In one major development, scientists discovered that immune cells played a critical role in the formation of blood vessels in the skin, and then were able to mimic the relevant instructions in a lab. They used chemicals to turn genes on and off at the right time and in the right places to grow skin artificially from stem cells. So far, they have grown tiny blobs of skin, out of which have sprouted little hairs.\n\nGreen light is used to illuminate a tiny blob of skin grown in a lab. The finger points to hair follicles\n\nAccording to Prof Haniffa, the eventual aim is to perfect the technique. \u201cIf you know how to build human skin, we can use that for burns patients and that can be a way of transplanting tissue,\" she said. \"Another example is that if you can build hair follicles, we can actually create hair growth for bald people.\u201d The skin in the dish can also be used to understand how inherited skin diseases develop and test out potential new treatments.\n\nInstructions for turning genes on and off are sent all across the developing embryo and continue after birth into adulthood to develop all our different organs and tissues. The Human Cell Atlas project has analysed 100 million cells from different parts of the body in the eight years it has been in operation. It has produced draft atlases of the brain and lung and researchers are working on the kidney, liver and heart. The next phase is to put the individual atlases together, according to Prof Sarah Teichmann of Cambridge University, who is one of the scientists who founded and leads the Human Cell Atlas Consortium. \u201cIt is incredibly exciting because it is giving us new insights into physiology, anatomy, a new understanding of humans,\u201d she told BBC news. \u201cIt will lead to a rewriting of the textbooks in terms of ourselves and our tissues and organs and how they function.\u201d Genetic instructions for how other parts of the body grow will be published in the coming weeks and months \u2013 until eventually we have a more complete picture of how humans are built.\n\nArt or science? This section shows how many genes are turned on to develop the lower intestine",

The Irish actor is set to star alongside Denzel Washington in the sequel to 2000's Gladiator, released next month. Speaking to the BBC's Graham Norton about the casting process, Mescal joked: \"Ridley does not waste time. \"I thought there would be camera tests and auditions, but we Zoomed for half an hour, spoke for 10 mins about the part and then 20 minutes about Gaelic football, his dog and his wife.\"\n\nMescal joked he had a personal trainer for the role \"who circled me like a shark\"\n\nMescal continued: \"I thought there would be more, but he called a few weeks later to offer me the part. \"I think he just goes by instinct, on set and off, and I\u2019m very glad that\u2019s the way it went.\" Of course, by the time Mescal spoke to Scott for the role, the director and film studio would already have been well aware of his acting abilities, box office power and popularity with awards voters.\n\u2022 None How to watch this year's awards-tipped films The actor shot to fame in 2020 in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel Normal People, which became an early TV hit of the lockdown pandemic.

    "Ben Stokes has pulled out of this year's IPL to manage his fitness and workload\n\nCaptain Ben Stokes has opted to skip next year's Indian Premier League but former England bowler James Anderson has registered for the upcoming auction. Stokes' name is not among the 52 Englishman who have signed up for the auction, which will be held on 24 and 25 November. It means the 33-year-old will also be unavailable for the 2026 competition under new rules announced by the IPL last month. But England's leading wicket-taker Anderson, 42, who retired from international duty in July, has put his name forward, as has pace bowler Jofra Archer. Anderson has not played since his final Test against West Indies at Lord's and has not played a T20 since 2014. He has never played in a global T20 franchise league. Archer's decision is interesting, given hopes he could return to Test cricket next summer. Named the IPL's most valuable player in 2020, the 29-year-old has made his comeback from a series of back and elbow injuries this year in white-ball cricket, but it is still hoped he could feature against India next summer and in the 2025-26 Ashes in Australia. The 2025 IPL will also clash with the early rounds of the County Championship, potentially preventing Archer from proving his fitness in the longer format. The IPL brought in a new rule this year that meant overseas players signed by franchises who later pull out will be banned from the competition for two years. The dates for the 2025 IPL have not been confirmed, but this year it ran from 22 March to 26 May. After the Champions Trophy concludes in early March, England do not play again until a four-day Test against Zimbabwe on 22 May.\n\nThe IPL said 1,574 players have signed up for the auction, although it has not released a list of names. Franchises will shortlist players they are interested in over the coming weeks with a full list published closer to the auction. No England players were retained by their franchises prior to the auction, with England white-ball captain Jos Buttler among those released. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has not commented on which centrally-contracted players have signed up for the auction. Buttler joined England's training session in Barbados on Monday as he targets a return from a calf injury in the T20 series against West Indies, which starts on Saturday. The 34-year-old has not played since the T20 World Cup in June and has confirmed he will not return as wicketkeeper in the Caribbean, with Phil Salt taking the gloves. Buttler has kept in 106 of his past 108 T20s for England, but will be replaced as part of the refresh of the white-ball sides following failed defences of their two world titles. \"Maybe it will get a little bit more out of him at mid-off, having an opportunity to chat to the bowlers,\" said Salt. \"The only thing that keeping takes away from you is the advantage of being there with the bowlers at the top of their marks all the time. \"Sometimes you can can get stuck in a bit of a position where the only times you're running up to a bowler is when things aren't going to plan and you're running up to reaffirm positive things.\"\n\u2022 None To keep or not to keep - Buttler's big decision",
    "The Princess of Wales hugs Liz Hatton at Windsor Castle\n\nThe Princess of Wales has embraced a teenage girl with an aggressive form of cancer during an an investiture at Windsor Castle. The princess, who last month ended chemotherapy, met with Liz Hatton, 16, after inviting the teenager to take photos. Liz, a budding photographer from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, who was told by doctors earlier this year she had between six months and three years to live, has a photography bucket list. Prince William and Catherine, who herself is a keen photographer, said the young girl had inspired them both.\n\nLiz was given the opportunity to take photos of the investiture, featuring cyclist Mark Cavendish and ex-footballer Ally McCoist, after Prince William heard about Liz through his patronage of London Air Ambulance Charity. After taking photos, the royal couple met Liz and her family at a private meeting. Prince William and Catherine wrote in a post on X: \"A pleasure to meet with Liz at Windsor today. \"A talented young photographer whose creativity and strength has inspired us both. Thank you for sharing your photos and story with us.\" A Kensington Palace spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing the investiture both the Prince and Princess of Wales met Liz privately with her family to hear about her day and journey.\" Liz said she was \"over the moon\" after meeting the couple at the castle. \u201cSuch lovely, genuine and kind people, I\u2019m over the moon that my family and I had this experience,\u201d she wrote on social media. The event is a rare appearance for Catherine who has been out of sight of the public for much of the year. The Palace previously indicated it is not possible at this stage to say whether the princess is cancer-free, despite completing chemotherapy treatment.\n\nLiz and her family met the Prince and Princess of Wales at a private meeting after the investiture\n\nLiz drew up a photography bucket list \"to create a lifetime of memories\" after being diagnosed with desmoplastic small round cell tumour in January. The rare nature of the cancer means there is currently no standard care treatment. Liz took up photography in Year 6 after saving up to buy her first camera and got the highest grade possible in the subject at GCSE, before starting an A-level in it at Harrogate Grammar School. Her mum, Vicky Roboyna, previously told the BBC her daughter's hobby had given her a \"focus\" since her diagnosis.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "Irish coalition leaders Simon Harris, Miche\u00e1l Martin and Roderic O'Gorman are set to meet next week\n\nT\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin has said a general election date will be discussed between the three coalition party leaders next week. A general election must be called in the Republic of Ireland before the term ends in March 2025, with speculation rising that a poll could be called imminently. It comes after Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman proposed 29 November for the upcoming election. Speaking in Dublin on Friday, O'Gorman said it was time for \"some degree of certainty\" to the Irish people about a date.\n\n\"I'm starting to get the sense that people are getting sick and tired of the will they, won't they,\" O'Gorman said. \"Now is the time to bring some degree of certainty to the Irish people in terms of the election date.\" O'Gorman said he would be meeting Martin, as well as Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris on Monday. \"What I'll be saying to them is that I think we need to bring clarity and I'll be saying my preference is for a November election, the 29 of November.\" \"That gives us the opportunity to get those final pieces of legislation through.\"\n\nGreen Party Roderic O'Gorman (right) indicated his support for a 29 November election date\n\nOn Friday, Harris said a date has not been set yet for the general election, but added that he will bring clarity on the matter \"shortly\". Speaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 News, the taoiseach said he wants the government to finish the work it has underway. He said he then wants to \"engage and take the views of the other coalition leaders in relation to the appropriate timing for a general election\". \"I want to do that at a time that is right for the country and I also want to do it at a time that makes sense in terms of finishing the work,\" Harris said. He added: \"I've been very clear that I certainly won't be doing engagement or consultation through the media, but I will be bringing clarity to this matter shortly\". Harris said he is conscious that it is his \"constitutional prerogative to decide when to seek a dissolution of the D\u00e1il (lower house of parliament)\". \"But I\u2019m also very conscious of the fact that I think this government has worked very well together and therefore I want the government to end well too.\"\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin says a date for the general election will be discussed on Monday\n\nThe t\u00e1naiste, also speaking on Friday, agreed that there is need for clarity around a poll date and said the issue will be discussed next week. Martin did not indicate a preferred date, but said he \"always\" favoured a February election date to allow the three-party government to complete its term \"The difference between December and February isn't huge,\" he told RT\u00c9 News. \"I always said we need to get work done before the general election, because we are here to represent people.\" He said the passage of the Finance Bill 2024, which contains new taxation provisions, was \"key\". \"That puts flesh on the bones of the Budget,\" Martin added. \"I would agree that there is a need for clarity at this stage, but I think this is something we can deal with next week.\"",
    "'The lights go out when it rains' - hundreds of schools waiting on builders\n\nThe vast majority of schools on a government rebuilding programme in England are waiting for builders, according to a Freedom of Information request.\n\nHundreds of old and leaky school buildings in England still don\u2019t have builders assigned to them - even though they\u2019re on a flagship government rebuilding programme, the BBC has found. More than 500 schools are on the scheme, but by this summer contracts had been awarded to construction companies to rebuild just 62 of them. The BBC has been looking into why targets are being missed. Industry experts have told us construction companies are nervous about taking on contracts in case costs exceed their budgets. But the Department for Education (DfE) says the programme is on track and forecasts were made before high inflation hit the construction industry.\n\nThe School Rebuilding Programme, announced in 2020, aims to rebuild or refurbish about 500 schools in a decade. Construction was due to start in 2021 at a rate of about 50 schools per year. However, according to the National Audit Office (NAO),, external the DfE forecast last year that it would complete fewer projects than it had initially planned. The BBC has found 23 schools have been completed so far and a further 490 are still waiting. Most do not yet have builders on board. The DfE originally projected, external that 83 contracts would be awarded by March 2023. However, its response to a BBC Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed only 62 had been issued by June 2024.\n\nPatchway Community School's rebuild has been delayed by at least a year, according to the head of its trust.\n\nPatchway Community School in Bristol was selected for the School Rebuilding Programme in 2021, but is still waiting to be assigned a construction company. \"Sometimes when it's raining, the light malfunctions and you can barely see anything,\" said Year 8 student Faizah. \"When we play games like dodgeball or basketball, some of the balls get stuck up in the roof because of the holes,\" said Logan, also in Year 8. Dave Baker, the chief executive officer of The Olympus Academy Trust, which runs Patchway, said the cracked ceiling in the school gym, like other areas of wear and tear, was \"not worth replacing, because the whole thing is going to be knocked down within the next two years\".\n\nDave Baker says Patchway is seen as the \"poor neighbour\" of others in the trust that have been built in recent years.\n\nHe said the rebuilding process had been delayed by at least a year, after a company that had signed up to rebuild Patchway pulled out. \"The contractors, it seems, felt that they couldn't deliver the building to the specification for the money that was available. That's our interpretation of what happened,\" he said. \"I feel that there are young people and their families who have been let down - and that\u2019s not OK.\" Mr Baker now hopes to have a new contract in place in the coming weeks, and a new school with \"the best facilities in the area\" in 2027. Building company Wates told the BBC it worked \"extensively\" with the DfE and had provided design services for Patchway, but the DfE \"decided on this occasion not to proceed with Wates for the building work\".\n\nAll bar one of Patchway Community School's buildings, which Mr Baker thinks date back to the 1950s, are set to be demolished.\n\nRebecca Larkin, from the Construction Products Association, which represents manufacturers, said while a lag between the announcement of the School Rebuilding Programme and getting spades in the ground was to be expected, it was still running behind. \"It is not coming through as quickly or on the schedule that was originally promised by the government,\" she said, adding that she would have expected about 100 contracts to have been awarded by now. Ms Larkin said high inflation may have made building companies \"reticent\" to take on contracts.\n\nRebecca Larkin says inflation has soared in the construction industry since the Covid pandemic.\n\n\"Construction contractors typically operate on very small margins, so if they sign up to a contract and then prices rise during the construction work, there is very little room for manoeuvre,\" she said. \"Given that there are fixed capital budgets in all government departments, there is very little room for them to manoeuvre as well, so you're in a kind of Catch-22 situation.\" Ms Larkin said updates on the programme were \"very infrequent\". Extra funding would help, she said, but the DfE was competing with other government departments for bigger budgets. Others told the BBC the recent collapse of construction company ISG, which had already started work on at least one school on the School Rebuilding Programme, could make it even harder for the DfE to find companies to take on the work.\n\nThe schools on the School Rebuilding Programme are those the DfE has deemed as being most in need. However, the NAO report last year said funding levels in England had contributed to the \"deterioration\" of the wider school estate - and 24,000 school buildings (38% of the total) were beyond their initial life design. James Ludlow, principal at Joseph Leckie Academy in Walsall, said he spent \u00a310,000 of the school's budget refurbishing its 1930s school hall this summer because he became \"fed up\" with the peeling paint and damp. \"We're having to spend a lot of money on patching things up,\" he said.\n\nThe NAO report also said the \"slower than planned\" progress of the School Rebuilding Programme was \"largely due to construction providers not taking up contracts\". It said the DfE had \"taken steps to address these issues, including by changing its approach to project funding policy to reflect market conditions\". The DfE told the BBC the programme was on track, and its original forecasts were made before events including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine affected industry prices. It said schools take an average of two to five years to build, and that some form of work had started at just under half of the projects - although it did not specify what type of work. In a statement, education minister Stephen Morgan said the government \"inherited a school estate in need of urgent repair... and without a comprehensive plan\" - and that this would \"not be a quick fix\".\n\nListen to Hazel Shearing's documentary Old School Problems at 13:30 BST on Sun 13 Oct and at 16:00 BST on Mon 14 Oct on BBC Radio 4.

    "'I was a Directioner - a generation of fangirls are grieving'\n\nLiam Payne (centre) had auditioned for The X Factor as a solo act but Simon Cowell teamed him up with four other young singers and created a bit of pop history\n\nAs vigils are held across the world for Liam Payne, BBC journalist Bonnie McLaren - a Directioner from the very start - explains her relationship with the band. When One Direction were on The X Factor, I was 12 years old. I\u2019ve often joked I was the perfect age to be indoctrinated. I hadn\u2019t previously shown any interest in boys - but Harry, Niall, Louis, Zayn and Liam were different. Their teenage good looks, their cheeky, charming personalities, and the fact they weren\u2019t much older than I was meant they quickly became my whole life. I followed all the classic fangirl rituals: reading One Direction fanfiction, watching every interview the band gave, maxing out my parents\u2019 landline phone bill by voting for them on The X Factor. For me, it was almost an afterthought that they were musically talented, something they proved as they honed their skills as performers during the reality show\u2019s weekly live performances, after being put together as a group by Simon Cowell. I wasn\u2019t alone in my obsession. Fans \u2013 or Directioners, as we were quickly named \u2013 were a huge, sprawling community. It was more common for girls in my year group at school to be besotted with them than not. We all had a favourite band member, and wore wristbands with Harry, Zayn, Liam, Louis or Niall\u2019s name on them. When the boys were seen in public, even in the early X Factor days, they were mobbed by adoring fans. During the band\u2019s time on the show, ITV also published video diaries on YouTube, which weren\u2019t included in the televised programme. Filmed as the boys sat on the stairs of the X Factor House, where they spent most of their time during the show, they offered an insight into the singers\u2019 personalities. In one clip, the band members were asked what their roles were in the group. \"Liam is the smart one, Harry is the flirt, Zayn is vain, Niall is the funny one,\" replies 18-year-old Louis, before Harry adds: \"Louis is the leader.\" We all clung to the bizarre facts revealed in these videos: that Liam hated spoons (he later explained he had a phobia of using them, in case they were dirty), and that Louis was obsessed with carrots. Following the band\u2019s time on The X Factor, my bedroom wall became plastered with their faces, and I begged my parents to let me see them on their first tour in 2012. I succeeded, and my mum drove me two hours with one of my school friends to go to a gig in Bournemouth \u2013 a show which was added in order to record the band\u2019s tour DVD. I\u2019ve never been in a room with people so excited. The hysterical screaming didn\u2019t seem to stop but it didn\u2019t bother me because, of course, I was also screaming my lungs out. When Zayn pointed in the direction of my One Direction banner, I fell to the floor crying. It wasn\u2019t an unusual response among the girls in the room.\n\nThe crowd at One Direction's concert at the Bournemouth International Centre\n\nWatch now on iPlayer (UK only)\n\nAt that time, I spent most of my free time online, keeping up with the boys, and with my new friends: fellow One Direction fans. One Direction formed around the time Twitter was taking off as a platform. Long before social media managers were commonplace, Liam, Harry, Zayn, Louis and Niall often tweeted from their personal accounts. Liam once tweeted the then-US president Barack Obama, asking if he\u2019d bought One Direction\u2019s debut album yet. He also asked Kim Kardashian what her favourite track on it was. For their part, fans would send hundreds of tweets to the boys, trying to get them to notice or follow them. Social media was still in its infancy but it made the band available to fans around the world in a way they wouldn\u2019t have been when The X Factor first aired in 2004 - 18 months before Twitter was founded. As One Direction grew up, so did I \u2013 and I started thinking about what I wanted to do for a job. Thanks to my obsession with the charts \u2013 and of course, One Direction \u2013 I knew I wanted to work in entertainment, interviewing the pop stars I\u2019d grown up listening to. The band had announced an indefinite hiatus by the time I started working in the industry in 2016. But even though I\u2019d grown up, and One Direction posters no longer lined my walls, my dream of meeting the band lived on.\n\nMeeting Liam again in 2018, at a gig in Camden's Koko\n\nBy the time I started working, the boys had started their solo careers, hoping to make their way in the business under their own names. The now 23-year-old Liam Payne\u2019s first single was Strip That Down, a collaboration with rapper Quavo that was co-written with Ed Sheeran. It was a worldwide hit, charting at number three in the UK and also reaching the US Top 10 when it was released in May 2017. He was keen to do the work to promote his music, and wouldn\u2019t shy away from talking to reporters at red carpet events. The first time I spoke to him in 2017, I was a student in journalism college, covering Capital Radio\u2019s Jingle Bell Ball. It was one of the first times I\u2019d covered an event on my own, and I was petrified, like a rabbit in the headlights standing in the scrum of reporters and flashing cameras. Then Liam walked down the red carpet in my direction, and he stopped to speak to me. I was 19, starstruck, and couldn\u2019t believe my luck \u2013 I was completely and utterly unprofessional. As soon as he approached me, I blurted out: \u201cOh my God, I was such a One Direction fan.\u201d He smiled, looked me in the eyes and thanked me, and managed to look interested even though he had likely heard my questions hundreds of times already that day. Liam seemed very well media-trained, and was comfortable with reporters, appearing to find it easy to build a good rapport with us. At the end of our chat, we took a quick selfie, which he was happy to pose for. The next time I interviewed Liam, it was as a junior reporter for a national newspaper, and his personable manner was much the same. In the years that followed, I didn\u2019t interview Liam again but I continued to read about his career. It was clear that fame wasn\u2019t always easy for him and, despite looking at home in front of a camera, he was later open about struggling with the pressures of celebrity and with alcohol. When the news of Liam\u2019s death broke on Wednesday, I was having dinner at a friend\u2019s house, and we sat watching the BBC News Channel in disbelief. I listened to One Direction on the way home and couldn\u2019t stop myself from crying. For me, and for countless others who grew up as Directioners, it feels like the end of something which was an integral part of our adolescence. For that, I\u2019ll always thank Liam.",

Watch the moment Bianca Williams is taken out of a car and handcuffed by police\n\nTwo former Metropolitan Police officers have been handed their jobs back and will receive back-pay after winning an appeal against their dismissal following their stop and search of two athletes. Met PCs Jonathan Clapham and Sam Franks were fired in October 2023 after their search of the Olympic sprinters Bianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos. The two men won their appeal against a ruling which found they lied by saying they could smell cannabis during the stop and search in west London in July 2020. Mr Dos Santos described the appeal decision as \"disappointing\" and said he and Ms Williams would challenge it in the civil courts.\n\nDuring the incident, the couple were pulled over by the officers and searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons, but nothing was found. The officers had followed Ms Williams and her partner Mr Dos Santos as they drove home from training with their baby, who was then three months old. Mr Clapham and Mr Franks were dismissed after a disciplinary panel found they had lied about smelling cannabis when they pulled over the athletes. Their dismissal was overturned by the Police Appeals Tribunal, which found the panel's decision was \"irrational\" and \"inconsistent\".\n\nBianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos said they would challenge the appeal decision\n\nThe dismissed PCs were \"dedicated, hard-working and much respected officers\" whose reputations had been \"ruined\" by the original findings, Appeals Tribunal chairman Damien Moore said. \"Both officers did not lie. Both officers will now be reinstated to the Met Police. They should receive back-pay,\" he said. \"Being a police officer in London brings about its own set of unique challenges,\" Mr Moore added. He wished Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos \"all good fortune\". Hugh Davies, representing Mr Clapham, said the officers had \"every reason to suspect criminality\" when they pulled Dos Santos over. Mr Davies said another officer at the scene had smelled cannabis, but was not found to have lied.\n\nIn response to the appeal ruling, Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jon Savell said: \u201cWe know this has been an overly lengthy and horrendous process for PC Clapham and PC Franks, as well as their families and colleagues.\" He added that the case had been \"hard on all involved\" and re-emphasised a previous apology from the force to Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos over the stop and search. \"Ultimately, the evidence has shown that the stop and search and the actions of the officers did not amount to misconduct,\" Mr Savell said. \"However, stop and search is most effective when used with the trust and confidence of Londoners.\" He added the new \"stop-and-search charter\" would help rebuild trust.\n\nIn a statement following the tribunal decision, Mr Dos Santos maintained that the \"actions and allegations\" by the officers had been \"completely unacceptable\". \"Our drive home from training in 2020, with our baby, should never have turned into a violent incident where we were wrongly accused of smelling of drugs,\" he said. \"We are professional athletes; we pride ourselves on not doing drugs.\" He added: \"We shall challenge today's outcome in the civil courts. Jules Carey, of the law firm Bindmans, which represents the couple, said the complaints system had \"failed again\" and it \"will be for the civil courts to address this result\".\n\nRick Prior, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the officers had been \"fully exonerated and their reputations have rightly been restored\". \"Justice has been served. Why it ever got to this point, however, remains an absolute mystery,\" he said. Mr Prior said the reinstatements were \"yet another damning indictment\" of the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which referred the officers to the misconduct tribunal. \"Our colleagues have been dragged through hell and back for four years, for doing nothing more or less than the job the public of London expect us to do,\" he added. An IOPC spokesperson said: \"We note the outcome today of the officers' appeal and await the written decision by the Police Appeals Tribunal.\"\n\nMs Williams won silver at the Paris Olympics as part of the relay team\n\nMs Williams had alleged that racial profiling played a factor in the officers' conduct, but this was not upheld in the original misconduct tribunal. At the Paris Olympics this summer, she competed as part of the women's 4x100m quartet that qualified for the final and went on to win a silver medal.",
    "Alexander Rogers was in his third year at the University of Oxford\n\nThe suicide of a young man \"cancelled\" by his peers at university has prompted a coroner to write to the government warning about \"self-policing\" among some students. Alexander Rogers, 20, was in his third year studying at the University of Oxford's Corpus Christi College when he took his own life in January. Oxfordshire coroner Nicholas Graham said Mr Rogers had been \"ostracised\" in the preceding days after a woman expressed discomfort about a sexual encounter between the pair. In a Prevention of Future Deaths Report, external, the coroner urged the Department for Education to take action to stop similar deaths occurring related to the harmful effects of being socially ostracised.\n\nHe said Mr Rogers had reported being subjected to \"name calling, targeted behaviour and exclusion and rejection following allegations made against him about his conduct\". Corpus Christi College commissioned an independent serious incident review following the death. \"That review identified evidence of a concerning practice of social ostracism among students, often referred to as a cancel culture,\" the coroner said. \"[The review's] evidence was that this behaviour, where individuals are isolated and excluded from social groups based on allegations or perceptions of wrongdoing, poses a significant risk to student mental health and well-being.\" He said students \"appear to employ social ostracism as a means of \u2018self-policing\u2019 their community, often in response to allegations of serious misconduct\". \"This occurs in the absence of formal processes and without proper investigation or evidence,\" Mr Graham said.\n\nMr Graham added: \"I did not find on the balance of probabilities that this culture specifically caused or contributed to Alexander\u2019s death, but it did give rise to a concern that circumstances creating a risk of future deaths could occur.\" Mr Rogers' family have been raising money for suicide prevention charity PAPYRUS. In a tribute on a fundraising page, they said: \"The loss of Zander has been seismic. \"He was and is the epitome of what is good in this world; kind, warm, funny, and an incredible friend to so many.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a tragic case and our thoughts are with Alexander\u2019s loved ones. \u201cIt is essential that students have access to the mental health support they deserve and that universities take all necessary steps to prevent suicides. \u201cWe will be working closely with the coroner, the higher education sector and suicide experts, to ensure that lessons from this case inform our ongoing efforts to support student welfare.\u201d Need help?

    "Boohoo is planning a major restructure that could see the break-up of the struggling online fashion firm whose brands include Debenhams, Karen Millen and PrettyLittleThing. The company said it was reviewing options after concluding that its business remained \"fundamentally undervalued\". While Boohoo benefited from the surge to online shopping during the pandemic, it has subsequently struggled against the likes of China's Shein and Temu. Analysts said Boohoo was likely to focus on offloading Debenhams and Karen Millen to allow it to concentrate on a younger target market.\n\n\"The starting gun has been fired on the break-up of Boohoo,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \"Selling Karen Millen and Debenhams is the obvious starting point, leaving Boohoo with a sharper focus on a younger target market.\" Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth added that fast-fashion firms were \"under pressure\" with shoppers thinking more sustainably and \"making different choices\". Boohoo bought Karen Millen for \u00a318.2m in 2019 and three years ago it took on department store brand Debenhams for \u00a355m. \"Acquired brands like Debenhams and Karen Millen, now purely online players, haven't had the impact on shoppers that the business might have liked,\" said Ms Shuttleworth. Boohoo admitted on Friday that its youth brands were struggling, including boohoo.com, boohooMAN and PrettyLittleThing, but said it expected that to improve in the second half of its financial year. Meanwhile, the company said its chief executive, John Lyttle, would be leaving. He joined the firm six years ago from Primark. Under Mr Lyttle, the business has attempted to shift its image away from fast fashion. In 2021, he told the BBC that Boohoo was not a \"throwaway fashion brand\" and the firm was aiming to be more sustainable. But in 2023, a BBC Panorama investigation found Boohoo had broken promises to make its clothes fairly and ethically. An undercover reporter saw evidence of staff pressuring suppliers to drive prices down, even after deals had been agreed. Boohoo said at the time it had experienced significant cost inflation in the previous year and as costs had started to come down, it asked suppliers to reflect this in their pricing. Earlier this year, the firm was found to have mislabelled some of its clothes, claiming they were made in the UK when they were actually made in South Asia. Boohoo said it was an isolated incident, which was down to a misinterpretation of labelling rules. On Friday, the company reported that its sales had fallen by 15% to \u00a3620m for the six months to the end of August. Trade tumbled across the UK, the US and internationally. Ms Shuttleworth added that the core Boohoo shopper had \"grown up\". \"The generation behind is enjoying instore shopping and looking at alternative brands for inspiration,\" she said.",
    "Russia vows 'tangible' response if US missiles used against its territory\n\nRussia says the use of US long-range missiles by Ukraine will lead to \"an appropriate and tangible\" response. Such an attack inside Russian territory \"would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia\", a foreign ministry statement said. President Joe Biden approved the use of the missiles on targets in Russia in a major change of US policy - two months before he is due to leave the White House. It is not clear if his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, was consulted or whether he will stick by the decision, having promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nUkraine has had US ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) with a range of 300km (190 miles) - as well as French and British Storm Shadow missiles of a similar range - but the Western allies had barred Kyiv from hitting Russia with them. Biden's decision to lift that condition is a significant moment in the war, which marks its 1,000th day on Tuesday. Moscow has now intensified attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure as the sides appear to have reached a stalemate on the battlefield.\n\u2022 None Could missiles change the course of the war?\n\u2022 None What we know about North Korean soldiers in Russia\n\u2022 None Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia The US decision also follows the arrival in Russia's western Kursk region - where Ukrainian forces captured and are holding onto a small piece of territory - of more than 10,000 troops from North Korea to help President Vladimir Putin's forces. Unconfirmed reports say North Korea may send as many as 100,000 soldiers, in addition to artillery and other weapons to its ally.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated there may be no formal announcement of the US deal - \"the missiles will speak for themselves,\" he said on Sunday. Ukraine may use the ATACMS in Kursk first - in fact some reports suggest the US may have restricted their use there as a signal to North Korea to stop sending aid to Russia and to Moscow itself. Biden's approval of the long-range missiles - which may be followed by similar authorisations by the UK and France - is being seen in the West as a way of signalling to the Russian leader that he cannot win the Ukraine war militarily. Putin has not commented on the latest move. In September, the Russian leader said the use of such missiles by Ukraine would represent the \"direct participation\" of Nato countries in the war. On Monday, Putin's spokesman said the US was \"adding oil to the fire\". But Jon Finer, US deputy national security adviser, said Washington had made it \"clear to the Russians that we would respond\" - both to the presence of North Korean forces and the \"major escalation\" in Russian aerial attacks on infrastructure across Ukraine. The weekend saw intense Russian attacks against Ukraine's power grid, causing large-scale blackouts. Several people were killed or injured. On Monday, a Russian strike on Odesa killed another 10 people and injured nearly 50.\n\nDonald Trump has not reacted to Biden's decision so far. He swept to victory on 5 November and will return to the White House on 20 January. Trump has promised to end US involvement in foreign wars and use the taxpayers' money to improve the lives of Americans. He has also said he will end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, but has not given details how. Zelensky recently said he expected Trump to exert pressure on Ukraine and Russia to agree a peace deal within the next year. Biden's decision was hailed by French President Emmanuel Macron as a \"totally good\" step. The US authorisation could potentially enable France and the UK to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadow missiles inside Russia. Storm Shadow is a Franco-British long-range cruise missile with similar capabilities to the ATACMS. So far, neither Macron nor UK Prime Minister Sir Keir have publicly said whether they will allow Kyiv to use their missiles in the same way. Meanwhile, China's Xi Jinping urged world leaders to \u201ccool the Ukraine crisis\u201d and seek a political solution, according to Chinese state media. China has become a vital partner for Russia, as it seeks to soften the impact of US and European sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations that it supplies Moscow with weapons.",
    "US charges man over alleged Iranian plot to kill Trump\n\nThe US government has brought charges against an Afghan national in connection with an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump before he was elected as the next president. The Department of Justice on Friday unsealed an indictment against Farhad Shakeri, 51, alleging he was tasked with \u201cproviding a plan\u201d to kill Trump. The US government said Mr Shakeri has not been arrested and is believed to be in Iran - which described the claims as \"completely baseless\". In a criminal complaint filed in Manhattan court, prosecutors allege that an official in Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard directed Mr Shakeri in September to devise a plan to surveil and kill Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran\u2019s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump,\u201d US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. The justice department also charged two others allegedly recruited to kill an American journalist who was an outspoken critic of Iran. The other individuals were identified by the justice department as Carlisle Rivera, also known as \"Pop\", 49, from Brooklyn, and Jonathon Loadholt, 36, from Staten Island. The two appeared in court in the Southern District of New York on Thursday and are being detained pending a trial. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said similar accusations of attempts to assassinate US presidents had been made in the past, which Iran denied and went on to be false. In a statement, Mr Baghaei added that repeating such claims risked \"further complicating the issues between the US and Iran\". Trump has faced two separate alleged assassination attempts this year. In July, a gunman grazed the former president's ear after shooting at him during a Pennsylvania rally. Then, in September, a man was arrested for pointing a rifle at Trump who was golfing on his course in West Palm Beach. Mr Shakeri was asked to come up with a plan to kill Trump in seven days, the indictment alleges. According to prosecutors, Mr Shakeri told law enforcement that he did not intend to propose a scheme to kill Trump within that seven-day timeframe, so the Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials put the plan on pause. Mr Shakeri said the Iranian government told him it would be easier to try to assassinate Trump after the election, because they believed he would lose, prosecutors said. Prosecutors described Mr Shakeri as an Afghan national who came to the US when he was a child. He was eventually deported around 2008 after spending 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction. Prosecutors say the 51-year-old used \u201ca network of criminal associates\u201d, from prison, including Mr Rivera and Mr Loadholt, to conduct surveillance on the Iranian government\u2019s targets. Mr Shakeri promised Mr Rivera and Mr Loadholt $100,000 to murder the American journalist, who had reported on the Iranian regime\u2019s human rights abuses and corruption, prosecutors alleged. The journalist, who was not named, had been targeted in the past, prosecutors said. In a post on social media Friday, Brooklyn-based journalist Masih Alinejad said the FBI had arrested two men for attempting to kill her. She said the alleged killers came to the front of her house in Brooklyn. \"I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech\u2014I don\u2019t want to die,\" Ms Alinejad wrote. \"I want to fight against tyranny, and I deserve to be safe.\" In addition to the American journalist and Trump, the indictment alleges the Iranian government sought to kill two Jewish American businesspeople living in New York City, who were supportive of Israel on social media. Mr Shakeri also told prosecutors that his Iranian contacts asked him to plan a mass shooting to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka in October 2024, a year after the Hamas attacks on Israel. Mr Shakeri, Mr Rivera and Mr Loadholt were all charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. They also face counts of money laundering conspiracy - which could lead to 20 years in prison - and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire.",

    "Chioma Nnadi took over from Edward Enninful at British Vogue last year\n\nThe fashion industry \"should be concerned\" by a trend back to using more skinny models, the editorial director of British Vogue has said. Chioma Nnadi suggested the change, following recent progress in body diversity, had been partly fuelled by the rise in popularity of Ozempic. \"I do think maybe perhaps Ozempic has something to do with it,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"We're in this moment where we're seeing the pendulum sort of swing back to skinny being 'in' and often these things are treated like a trend and we don't want them to be.\"\n\nAsked by presenter Emma Barnett what was fuelling the trend, Nnadi said: \"I don't think we can pin it on any one thing. \"I do think that Ozempic has something to do with it because we're seeing a lot of celebrities who are using it, and I think there's this shift in the culture around how we think about our bodies and how we address our bodies.\" Nnadi said she thought it was \"important that all bodies are represented\" in fashion, adding that it was an issue she and her colleagues were mindful of. \"Thinking about the models that we can have in our [photo] shoots is very important,\" she continued. \"And it was very important that we included models who were not sample size. \"But I think it's not something that we, as a magazine, can change on our own, because obviously the designers are making clothes that are sample size.\" Referring to last season's fashion weeks, where designers showcase their new collections, Nnadi said: \"I didn't think there was enough representation as far as body diversity. \"And it felt almost like, at certain shows, the models were especially thin. \"Hopefully the season will be a wake-up call and it won't be that we see that kind of negative trend [and] that we see that progress.\"\n\nNnadi took over at the UK edition of Vogue last October, replacing the magazine's previous editor Edward Enninful. The job title was changed to head of editorial content when she joined, but Nnadi is still ultimately the most senior figure at the magazine. Ozempic has become popular in the US in recent years and its use has been increasing in the UK.",
    "Crowds gathered at a nearby hospital where dead and wounded people were taken\n\nAt least 18 people including several Hamas fighters have been killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarm, the Palestinian health ministry said late on Thursday. The Palestinian Authority-run news agency Wafa said the strike had hit a cafe in the Tulkarm refugee camp where many civilians were present. Hamas confirmed that commander Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi was killed by the strike, who the IDF say attempted a car bombing last month and supplied weapons. The Israeli military said the air strike was a joint operation with its Shin Bet security service, aimed at killing Oufi and \"other significant terrorists\".\n\nHamas\u2019s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said on messaging app Telegram that seven of its fighters were killed in the attack on the cafe. There was a further spike in violence in the West Bank after Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza, in what was already the occupied territory's deadliest year on record. Since then, more than 700 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, according to the Palestinian health ministry, as Israeli forces have intensified their raids. The IDF has said it is trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. The Israeli military has carried out dozens of air strikes in the occupied West Bank in the past year, but normally using drones or helicopters. One resident from the area told AFP news agency the Israeli had \"hit a cafeteria in a three-story building.\" \"There are many victims in the hospital,\" the resident added.\n\nIt said he had been planning another attack imminently, and was killed along with several other Hamas operatives. Wafa quoted a local official as saying children and elderly people from several families had been killed in the strike. There were also a large number of injured. A local cafe owner and brother of one of those killed told Reuters news agency: \"We are used to missile sounds, drones and the explosive drones, but the sound was strong. \"We haven't heard this sound since 2002, during the second Palestinian uprising.\" Another witness, named as Abdallah Kanana, told the agency he was thrown from his chair as a result of the explosion.\n\nThe UN rights office condemned the attack in a statement on Friday. \"The strike is part of a highly concerning pattern of unlawful use of force by ISF (Israeli security forces) during military-like operations in the West Bank that have caused widespread harm to Palestinians and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure,\" the UN said. Tulkarm was one of the towns and Palestinian refugee camps targeted during a major Israeli military operation in August. Last month UN rights chief Volker Turk said major Israeli operations in the occupied West Bank were taking place \"at a scale not witnessed in the last two decades\". Meanwhile, at least 24 Israelis including members of the security forces have been killed by Palestinian attackers in the same period, according to Israeli officials.",
    "The Royal Family has received millions of pounds of income in rent from the NHS, schools and the armed forces, a new documentary has revealed. In the investigation by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches and the Sunday Times, external, it is reported that the private estates of King Charles and Prince William hold contracts with public bodies and charities. Dame Margaret Hodge told the BBC on Sunday the findings have raised \"serious question marks\" and has called for a \"full and transparent review\" of both duchies. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of King Charles, said it \"complies with all relevant UK legislation and regulatory standards applicable to its range of business activities\".\n\nOver the past year, deals made by the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall have raised around \u00a350 million, it has been claimed. The Duchy of Lancaster, established in 1399, and Prince William's Duchy of Cornwall, established in 1337, both hold large amounts of land and commercial property in England and Wales. Their contracts with public bodies are said to include a \u00a337.5 million agreement between the Duchy of Cornwall and the Ministry of Justice to lease Dartmoor Prison, and a \u00a311.4 million deal between Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust and the Duchy of Lancaster to rent a London warehouse over 15 years to store ambulances. The estates also reportedly charge the Ministry of Defence for access to moor boats and refuel warships, some state schools to use their properties, and a local borough council to operate a toll bridge. The estates are not subject to corporation tax and the royals do not pay capital gains tax on the assets they sell. They voluntarily pay income tax on the surplus. The programme, Dispatches\u2019 The King, The Prince and Their Secret Millions, reports that details of the rental agreements have not been given to Parliament. The report points out that the duchies say they are not funded by taxpayers, but they do receive income from public services. The documentary raises concerns about the environmental impact of some of the estates' contracts, including those with mining companies.\n\nThe two private estates are separate to the Crown Estate. Profits from the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury. The level of profit made by the Crown Estate is used as a benchmark to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family in the form of the Sovereign Grant. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant will rise to \u00a3132 million in the next financial year, after profits from the Crown Estate increased to \u00a31.1 billion. Dame Hodge, a former chair of the Public Accounts Committee said: \"We all love the monarchy, we all want it to work. But we want them to lead by example in the way they conduct their finances. \"They don\u2019t pay capital gains tax and they don't pay corporation tax, yet they claim to act commercially,\" she said. \"But they can\u2019t have it both ways. If they want to be private and commercial they have to pay the fair rate of tax as everyone else does, otherwise they get a competitive advantage\". A Duchy of Cornwall spokesperson said it is \"a private estate with a commercial imperative which we achieve alongside our commitment to restoring the natural environment and generating positive social impact for our communities\". On the issue of mining, the spokesperson said that the duchy was \u201cacting responsibly and in a sustainable way\u201d in line with the government\u2019s industrial strategy, which encourages investment in domestic sources of minerals. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said it operates \"as a commercial company, managing a broad range of land and property assets across England and Wales\". They said that the duchy \"delegates certain functions, particularly those regarding asset management, to the Duchy Council\" and while the King \"takes a close interest\" in the work of the duchy, day-to-day management of the portfolio is the responsibility of the council and executive team. It added it had made \"a number of key environmental improvements in recent years\".\n\u2022 None Royals to get extra \u00a345m as Crown Estate profits soar",

    "Former Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy says he was lent money by his then team-mates Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez when the club stopped paying him after he was charged with rape and sexual assault, an employment tribunal has heard.\n\nThe France defender is claiming \u00a311.5m in unpaid wages from when he was charged in August 2021 and suspended without pay by City.\n\nMendy, 30, was cleared in 2023 of a series of rape and attempted rape charges made against him.\n\nThe club continued paying Mendy after his first arrest in November 2020, but argued they did not have to after he was charged as his bail conditions - one of which prevented him from going near the club's stadium or training ground - and a Football Association suspension meant he was not able to perform his contractual duties.\n\nCourt documents said Mendy \"very quickly ran out of money\" and had to sell his Cheshire mansion to cover legal fees, bills and child support payments after his wages were withheld.\n\n\"Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez all lent me money to help me try and pay my legal fees and support my family,\" Mendy said in his witness statement.\n\nIn November 2022, Mendy sent a Whatsapp message to Omar Berrada, who was City's Chief Football Operations' Officer from September 2020 to July 2024, to ask when he would receive his outstanding salaries but received no reply.\n\nMendy's agent Meissa N'Diaye, who also spoke at the hearing, said on 20 September 2021 he spoke to Berrada and was told \"once the trial was over Benjamin would be paid back all the salary that had been suspended\".\n\nBerrada, who is now Manchester United's chief executive, denied giving assurances when asked about this at the hearing.\n\nThe hearing also addressed how on 15 separate occasions Mendy either held or attended parties in breach of Covid-19 or bail conditions, or both.\n\nUnder questioning from City's counsel Sean Jones, Mendy admitted his behaviour in continuing to hold parties represented \"a risk\".\n\nWhen Jones said to Mendy: \"The truth is you couldn't care less it exposed you to risk,\" the full-back replied via videolink: \"At the time, yes.\"\n\nIn statements submitted to the court, Mendy said he felt he had been singled out by City as \"several first-team players, including the club captain, had attended the parties I had attended and hosted\" without repercussions.\n\nMendy said he rejected an offer to cancel his contract because he \"wanted to go back and train with his team\".\n\nIn his witness statement, he added: \"I believe that it is fair and just for me to be paid the wages that I would have earned but for being falsely arrested for crimes that I did not commit.\"\n\nMendy joined City from Monaco in a \u00a352m deal in 2017 and won Premier League titles in 2018, 2019 and 2021.\n\nHis final appearance for the club was in the Premier League on 15 August 2021.\n\nMendy left City when his contract expired in June 2023 and currently plays for French side Lorient.\n\nMendy was remanded in custody for five months before he was released on bail in January 2022. The case went to trial for the first time in August 2022.\n\nIn January 2023 he was cleared of six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.\n\nHe was then cleared of raping a woman and attempting to rape another in July 2023 at a retrial.\n\nThe tribunal hearing is expected to last two days.",

The tractor was driven through Tenbury Wells during floods at the weekend\n\nA man has been arrested after a tractor driver was seen driving through deep floodwaters in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, which led to damage to shops. The town centre was flooded on Sunday after a wall collapsed by Kyre Brook. In a video shared on social media, a wave from the tractor was seen striking shops and homes overlooking the street, breaking some windows. A 57-year-old was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving and released on bail while inquiries continue, police said.\n\nGreetings card shop proprietors Garry and Sarah Thomas said they were worried about how long it would take businesses to recover from the flood\n\nInsp Dave Wise, of West Mercia Police, said: \"I'd like to thank everyone who brought this incident to our attention and to the local community for their cooperation and support yesterday while we carried our initial inquiries.\" Adding he understood the upset and anger caused, he said: \"Officers will continue to be out and about in Tenbury in the coming days to assist the local community and our partner agencies with recovery efforts following the flooding.\"\n\nA clean-up is ongoing in Tenbury Wells after the main streets flooded on Sunday\n\nFollowing the wall collapse, a torrent of water deluged the town centre within seconds with rescue workers yelling to pedestrians to \"get back\".

Paul and Rachel Rogers, from Nature's Design Studio, described how water entered their shop for the first time after windows broke. \"It's caused so much devastation,\" Mrs Rogers said. \"We have buildings insurance but we don't have contents insurance. It's going to cost us.\" The Crow pub also flooded after water overwhelmed sandbags and smashed through windows. Licensee Paul Birkin described it as a \"miracle\" nobody was hurt. \"[The water] actually hit the back wall you know, I mean there's glass all over the place,\" he said. \"Absolutely distraught.\"\n\nPaul and Rachel Rogers, from Nature's Design Studio, were concerned insurers would not cover the cost of flood damage\n\nWorcestershire county councillor David Chambers described his frustration over the lack of flood defences in the town.

    "Folic acid is to be added to non-wholemeal wheat flour in the UK to help prevent birth defects. Adding folic acid to flour could prevent around 200 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, every year, and improve the health of pregnant women, says the government, which is giving manufacturers until the end of 2026 to conform to the new legal requirement, external. Expectant mothers and women trying to conceive should continue to take supplementary folic acid - the synthetic version of the vitamin folate - as currently advised by medical practioners. Folic acid is particularly important in early pregnancy, aiding proper development of the baby's brain, skull and spinal cord.\n\nExperts, many of whom have called for the move for a number of years, have welcomed the government's decision. The announcement follows health improvements in other countries, such as Australia and Canada, where the practice is already carried out. Some say the change doesn't go far enough, however, and more foods should be included. Prof Neena Modi, professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London, said: \"This will disadvantage groups such as women who are sensitive to gluten, eat rice in preference to bread, and products made from wholemeal flour - excluding them and their babies from benefiting, and thus adding to the considerable health inequities that already exist in the UK.\" The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose from eating a regular, healthy diet. In addition, the NHS recommends women who are trying for a baby take folic acid supplements for approximately three months before getting pregnant, and for at least 12 weeks after becoming pregnant. This recommendation will remain in place. It is estimated that half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned. The fortification of flour will therefore help boost intake of folic acid across the population, and, indirectly, better protect unborn babies. The government's independent advisory body has looked at all the evidence and is satisfied that fortification is the right course of action for society as a whole. Small-scale millers (producing less than 500 metric tonnes of flour a year) will be exempt. Flour is already fortified with calcium, niacin, thiamine and iron as a means of improving public health.",
    "Labour suspends MP after CCTV appears to show him punching man\n\nLabour MP Mike Amesbury has been suspended from the party and has had the whip withdrawn, after CCTV footage emerged appearing to show him punching a man to the ground. In footage obtained by the Daily Mail,, external the Runcorn and Helsby MP is apparently seen continuing to hit the man as he lies in the street. Cheshire Police said a 55-year-old man has been voluntarily interviewed under caution in relation to the incident and has since been released pending further enquiries. Amesbury has been contacted for comment.\n\nIt comes after a different video, posted on X, purported to show Amesbury shouting and swearing at the man lying in the street in Frodsham, Cheshire. A Labour party spokesman said: \u201cMike Amesbury MP has been assisting Cheshire Police with their inquiries following an incident on Friday night. \"As these inquiries are now ongoing, the Labour Party has administratively suspended Mr Amesbury\u2019s membership of the Labour Party pending an investigation.\u201d He has also lost the Labour whip in the House of Commons. It is not clear what happened in the build-up to the moments caught on film. In the initial clip, Amesbury can be heard shouting: \"You won't threaten the MP ever again, will you?\" In a statement issued before the Daily Mail footage emerged, Cheshire Police said: \u201cAt 02:48 BST on Saturday 26 October police were called to reports of an assault in Frodsham. \u201cA caller reported he had been assaulted by a man in Main Street. Enquiries are ongoing.\u201d Posting on his own Facebook page on Saturday, the 55-year-old backbencher said: \"Last night I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened following an evening out with friends. \"This morning I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened. \"I will not be making any further public comment but will of course cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A clip, which emerged on Saturday before the new CCTV footage, appears to show Amesbury shouting at a man lying on the pavement.\n\nAsked on Sunday morning about the initial clip and police statement, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the BBC: \"The police are now investigating the matter. \"I think that it\u2019s important they\u2019re allowed to get on and do their job and there\u2019s not much more I can say at this point.\" A Conservative Party spokesman said Amesbury \"has questions to answer about his actions\", adding that it was \"right they are thoroughly investigated\". A spokesperson for Reform UK - whose candidate came second behind Amesbury in July's general election - called for him to resign. Former Conservative MP Dehenna Davison, whose father died from a single punch, called the CCTV footage \"horrendous\". In a post on X, external, she said: \"The police are investigating and I am sure the full facts will emerge soon. \"I have spent years working with One Punch UK to raise awareness of the dangers a single punch can cause. \"Such violence - whatever the background to the altercation - is never and should never be justified.\" Amesbury has been a Labour MP in Cheshire since 2017 and served as a shadow minister between 2018 and 2024.

    "'I instantly knew my daughter's ex had killed her'\n\nHolly Newton lived in Haltwhistle, Northumberland, and went to school in Hexham\n\nIn January last year 15-year-old Holly Newton was stalked and then murdered by her teenage ex-boyfriend. She was too young to be classed as a victim of domestic violence but her family believes her death should be recognised as such in order to help save young lives in the future. When Holly's mum, Micala Trussler, got the call on a Friday night to say her daughter had been stabbed in Hexham, Northumberland, she instantly knew who the attacker was. Logan MacPhail, now 17, had been obsessed with Holly during their 18-month, on-off relationship and was determined to control her, Micala says. \"He didn't like her having other friends, he didn't like her going out without him, he needed to know where she was at all times. \"It was all just control, everything was controlling and when he couldn't control her there was a problem.\"\n\nLogan MacPhail and Holly Newton were in a relationship for 18 months\n\nMicala and her partner Lee had not realised there was an issue until Holly's friends pointed out how \"toxic\" MacPhail's behaviour was. \"At first that was a bit of a shock to Holly,\" she says. \"I don't think she understood it was happening to her until the very last few days.\"\n\u2022 None If you are affected by the content of this article, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line. Holly met MacPhail at army cadets, where he learned how to covertly follow targets and had expressed an interest in becoming a sniper. They had broken up on multiple occasions but he would often then threaten to kill himself, making her feel guilty. The night before MacPhail murdered Holly, he waited for hours outside her family home in Haltwhistle claiming he just wanted to get his games console back. He messaged a sibling of Holly's asking if they could help him \"sneak in\" but the sibling refused. Eventually he was taken home by the police after they were alerted to his whereabouts by his mother.\n\nHolly's mother Micala said she \"instantly knew\" who had killed her daughter\n\n\"I think if [MacPhail had] somehow managed to get into the house it could have been a whole different story \u2013 we could have been looking at maybe more than one murder,\" Micala says. So concerned was she about MacPhail's appearance at her family's home that Micala arranged a meeting with Northumbria Police to discuss her fears. It was scheduled for 27 January, the day Holly was killed. \"They'd agreed to come out at four o'clock on the Friday so I told Holly and she said 'I was supposed to be going out with my friends tonight'. She begged me,\" Micala recalls. \"She said 'He ruins everything for me, I want to go out'. \"The biggest mistake of my life, I agreed.\" The police meeting was pushed back to the evening, Holly was stabbed to death hours before it was due to take place.\n\nMacPhail secretly followed her after she left school, having lied about being in Newcastle to put her at ease. He went on to stab her multiple times in an alleyway during an attack that was so frenzied that the kitchen knife snapped. When people intervened he told them Holly had been \"horrible\" to him. He also told jurors Holly had hugged him and said she loved him and he thought he was stabbing himself \"but it went too far\". They did not believe him.\n\nIt took 18 months for the case to get to court because MacPhail's legal team had argued his learning difficulties and autism diagnosis made him unfit to plead. This would have meant he was unable to fully comprehend the criminal proceedings, but after hearing evidence from various experts the judge ruled that he was capable of following the process. Throughout the trial the defence team suggested that his various issues meant he did not understand the consequences of his actions. But jurors did not agree.\n\nLee and Micala Trussler hope Holly's story may educate others about domestic abuse in young relationships\n\nFor Micala, Holly's murder raises important questions about the classification of the crime. Because her daughter was too young to be classed as a victim of domestic violence, external her death will instead be filed for statistical reasons as a knife crime. That has connotations of gang violence and may give a misleading impression of the issues in Holly's case, Micala says. It also means the focus is on the weapon used rather than the build up, which had all the warning signs of domestic abuse.\n\nHolly was in the army cadets where her stepfather was an instructor\n\nMicala fears this means valuable lessons to save young people from abusive relationships in the future could be missed. \"I think he would have killed her just so she couldn't be with anybody else because it was all about control, obsession and passion,\" she says. \"We need to realise now that young people are having relationships a lot younger. \"You can almost guarantee that Holly is not the only one in that situation. \"We spend a lot of time in schools talking about abuse at home, being abused by your parent or other family members, but there's not really any discussion of being abused by a partner, being abused when you are in a relationship yourself.\"\n\nAnd then there is understanding what abuse actually looks like, Micala says. \"Certain levels of abuse are taken more seriously than others, like the controlling side of things and is it stalking, constantly texting people and ringing? \"Holly was never physically abused, but she was definitely abused in other forms.\"",

    "A car park close to Baalbek's Unesco-designated Roman ruins was hit in an Israeli air strike\n\nFor over two millennia, the Roman temples at Baalbek in eastern Lebanon have stood as some of the finest examples of Roman architecture anywhere in the world. On Wednesday, a car park just metres away from the Unesco World Heritage site was hit by an Israeli air strike. The attack, which also destroyed a centuries-old Ottoman building, highlighted what some archaeologists say is the risk of irreparable damage to historical sites across Lebanon from the current war between Israel and Hezbollah. \"Baalbek is the major Roman site in Lebanon. You couldn't replace it if someone bombed it,\" says Graham Philip, an archaeology professor at Durham University. \"It would be a huge loss. It would be a crime.\"\n\nSince late September, Israel has pummelled Lebanon with thousands of air strikes in an escalation of its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group it has been fighting in nearly a year of cross-border strikes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has largely been targeting southern Lebanon, suburbs in the capital Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley. But in the past fortnight, the campaign has moved into new areas, or rather, very old ground. The IDF told the BBC that it only targets military sites. But those targets are incredibly close to the Baalbek temples and Roman ruins in Tyre, a major port of the Phoenician Empire around 2,500 years ago. According to legend, Tyre is the place where purple pigment was first created - the dye crushed out of snail shells to embroider royal robes. On 23 October, the IDF issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods close to the city's Roman ruins, including the remains of a necropolis and a hippodrome. Hours later it began striking targets. More bombing of the sites was reported last week. Videos from the strikes showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from seafront areas only a few hundred metres from the ruins.\n\nUnesco says the Temple of Bacchus in Baalbek is one of the world's finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture\n\nThere is no evidence that the Roman sites in Tyre and Baalbek have been damaged by the Israeli strikes. But Lebanese archaeologists are alarmed at how close the fighting has been to the millennia-old ruins, recognised by Unesco as having outstanding value to humanity. \"For Baalbek it was even worse than Tyre, because the temples are located within the area that is targeted and [the IDF] did not make any exemption for the temples,\" says local archaeologist Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly. She says there are no Hezbollah facilities at the Baalbek site: \"No one knows what the excuse or the message behind the hit is.\" The IDF disputes this. In a statement, it told the BBC it targets military sites in accordance with strict protocol, adding that it is \"aware of the existence of sensitive sites and this is taken into account and constitutes an essential part of the planning of strikes\". \"Each strike that poses a risk to a sensitive structure is weighed carefully and goes through a rigorous approval process as required.\"\n\nIsrael released target zones for Tyre on 23 October which included settlements near the ancient ruins but not the Unesco site itself or the Old Town\n\nSome ordinary Lebanese attempting to escape Israeli bombing reportedly fled to the Baalbek ruins, judging that ancient sites would not be targeted by Israel and would therefore offer protection. Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says \"those who didn't have a car to flee\" moved closer to the ruins, in the belief that the Unesco sites are considered more valuable than their lives. It prompted the local government to issue a warning urging people against travelling to the ruins. \"They see the site as their shelter. But the site is not a shelter,\" Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says. The war puts Israel in a \"difficult situation\", says Israeli archaeologist Erez Ben-Yosef. He said that war damage to important archaeological sites would be a \"huge loss to the cultural heritage of Lebanon and indeed the entire world. \"However, I know personally that Israel is doing everything it can to prevent such damage. \"Many of my fellow archaeologists, both colleagues and students, serve in the army and participate in the war... they actively work to prevent such damage, in accordance with the general guidelines of our military.\"\n\nSmoke billowed out over the port city of Tyre\n\nGraham Philip, the Durham University archaeology professor, says he doesn\u2019t believe Israel would intentionally hit Baalbek or other sites. \"It's hard to see what they would gain in a military sense, bombing a Roman temple.\" But he cautioned about the risk of some bombs or missiles going off target and hitting the ruins, even unintentionally: \"If you drop enough ordnance, not all of that lands within 25 metres of the target.\" Mr Philip has been closely monitoring the impact of Israel's strikes on heritage sites in Gaza where it is fighting Hamas, leading a British university team documenting archaeological destruction, external across the territory. He says it is still too early to assess how much damage has been done by the current wars in Lebanon and Gaza. But a Unesco survey published in September found that 69 cultural heritage sites in Gaza had been damaged by the war, which was triggered by the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. The oldest mosque in Gaza, the Great Omari Mosque, is one. It was built on the site of an ancient Philistine temple before being converted into a church and then a mosque. It was reportedly mostly destroyed by an Israeli strike in December 2023. Mr Philip says these ancient sites are not only important anchors to the classical past, but are \"almost like the soul of a population\". \"Imagine how people would feel in Britain if the Tower of London or Stonehenge were destroyed. \"It's part of their identity.\"",
    "A British man has been captured by Russian forces while fighting for Ukraine, according to reports. In a video circulating online, a man dressed in military clothing identifies himself as James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, and says he formerly served in the British Army. Russian state news agency Tass quotes a military source saying that what they call a \"UK mercenary\" had been \"taken prisoner in the Kursk area\" of Russia, part of which Ukraine has held since launching a surprise offensive in August. The foreign secretary said: \"We will do all we can to offer this UK national all the support we can.\"\n\nAsked about reports of Mr Anderson's capture, David Lammy said he had \"been updated about that development in the last couple of days\". Scott Anderson, Mr Anderson's father, said he had begged his son not to go to Ukraine. \"He wanted to go out there because he thought he was doing what was right,\" Mr Anderson told the Daily Mail. \"I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be used as a bargaining chip, but my son told me they torture their prisoners and I\u2019m so frightened he\u2019ll be tortured.\" Mr Anderson said he was sent the video by his son\u2019s commander and was left \"in complete shock and tears\". \"I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared and worried,\" he added. In the video, first posted to the Telegram messaging platform, Mr Anderson tells a man questioning him from behind a camera that he served as a private in the British Army from 2019 to 2023. He says he joined the Ukraine's International Legion - a military unit made up of foreign volunteers - after losing his job and seeing reports on television about the war. He says he flew to Krakow in Poland from Luton and travelled from there by bus to the Ukrainian border. Ukraine launched a surprise attack into Kursk on 6 August, advancing up to 18 miles (29km) and taking control of around 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory. Russia has deployed some 50,000 troops to the region, and has begun retaking territory amid fierce fighting. The Foreign Office said it was \"supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention\".",
    "'Hardest decision of my career': MPs wrestle with assisted dying choice\n\nCatherine Fookes, Rebecca Paul, Dan Tomlinson and Jess Asato will vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday\n\nOn Friday, MPs will make one of the most profound decisions of their political careers: how to vote on the assisted dying bill. If it became law, the bill, external would give some terminally ill people in England and Wales the right to die at a time of their choosing. Hundreds of MPs have spent the last few weeks sifting through the evidence, emotions and ethical dilemmas of the bill. As they grapple with their decision, four MPs - Dan Tomlinson, Jess Asato, Rebecca Paul and Catherine Fookes - speak to the BBC about how they have been making up their minds. Tomlinson, the new Labour MP for Chipping Barnet in London, says he \u201cdefinitely feels the responsibility\" on his shoulders \"to have thought this through\u201d as Friday draws closer.\n\nThe issue has split Parliament, and the outcome of the vote is unknown, as the majority of MPs have not revealed how they will vote. MPs have been given a free vote, meaning they can follow their conscience rather than party orders. But it also leaves them to bear the responsibility - and the consequences - of their choice alone. MPs normally gauge the mood of their constituents via the emails that flood into their offices, discussions and regular meetings. But the assisted dying bill feels different, inspiring greater reflection and a deeper dive into personal experiences. In the week leading up to the debate, Tomlinson has attended two town hall gatherings: one with constituents in favour and one with those against. Hundreds braved a wintry London evening at the Finchley Reform Synagogue to hear speakers, including a palliative care doctor and Tory peer Lord Finkelstein, argue the case for assisted dying. The crowd was calm and receptive but the air chilled momentarily when Tomlinson asked if the law might push more people to end their lives to avoid burdening families or the NHS.\n\nDan Tomlinson asks questions during a debate with supporters of the assisted dying bill at a north London synagogue\n\nThe people gathered in the synagogue were eager for religious, legal and data-driven arguments in favour of assisted dying, and many voiced fears about loved ones in agony who would be ineligible under the terms of the proposed law. Outside the meeting, one organiser Andrew Jacobs, 70, said he would \"be very disappointed\" if Tomlinson did not vote in favour of the bill on Friday. In a matter-of-fact tone, Mr Jacobs said he backed assisted dying after seeing his mother's struggle during her final days. \u201cShe told me, \u2018my body is a burden to me. If I were a pet, you\u2019d put me down',\u201d he recalled. \"Seeing a loved one in distress, it's really hard.\" Reflecting on the discussion, Tomlinson says he recognises the strength of \"emotion and feeling in this debate - and that\u2019s right and proper\". \"But I didn't come into politics to shy away from difficult and challenging questions.\"\n\nJess Asato says public meetings have helped her \"get closer to knowing how I am going to vote\u201d\n\nTomlinson's fellow Labour MP, Jess Asato, has also spent the last two weeks holding regular meetings with constituents. A debate held in a cavernous theatre in her Lowestoft constituency saw locals clash over both the principle and scope of the bill. A terminally ill man who had been left \"severely disabled\" argued he deserved the right to access assisted dying. The silent hall erupted into applause as he told the crowd: \"I want to decide when I want to go, I want to go peacefully.\" After the meeting, Asato tells the BBC that MPs \"feel the pressure\" of the bill, and that she feels the \"responsibility to vote with my conscience, for my constituents and the country\u201d. She says she is approaching the debate from a \"policy perspective\". To do this, she is trying to \"understand what has happened in other countries such as Canada and the Netherlands\u201d which have legalised assisted dying. A key concern is whether the safeguards in the bill are robust enough to prevent people from being pressured or coerced into ending their lives. Before entering Parliament, Asato worked as a domestic abuse campaigner and learned \"many people never spot coercive controlling behaviour - often not even the victims themselves\u201d.\n\nJess Asato helped organise a public meeting to discuss assisted dying at the Players Theatre in Lowestoft\n\nThe importance of the vote is not lost on Rebecca Paul, who became Conservative MP for Reigate in July. \u201cI think anyone who is not daunted would be slightly worrying because they\u2019re probably not realising the full gravity of it,\" she says. As well as public meetings, MPs have been consulting widely in private. Tomlinson says he has been meeting healthcare workers and GPs who may end up being responsible for enacting new assisted dying legislation. Paul turned to her friend Dr David Montgomery, a former Tory parliamentary candidate and medical researcher. Huddled against the cold in a park near Paul's Reigate constituency, Dr Montgomery argues it is difficult to accurately predict if someone has six months left to live: a key strand of the bill. \u201cYou can tell when people are very close to death. \"But the prediction of six months as an arbitrary figure which is going to be open to huge interpretation and therefore I suspect quite a lot of legal challenge.\" Despite his concerns, Dr Montgomery says the trend of Britons going to Switzerland to die proves the UK must debate assisted dying. \"I'm not sure this is the way to have it,\" he says. Paul says she votes by trying \"to take some of the emotion out\" of debates and bases her decision on \"facts and evidence\". Her vote hinges not only on the principle but \"how this would work in practice\".\n\nIt was watching her father suffer through a painful terminal illness that led the Labour MP for Monmouthshire, Catherine Fookes, to support the bill. \"The last few days were incredibly difficult, he was in a lot of pain and it was really, really, really hard to see someone you really love going through that,\" she says. \"He struggled to breathe and so seeing him like that made me realise that we needed a change of the law.\" Fookes admits it wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but says her dad's struggle informed her choice. This legislation - a private member's bill - was introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who said she had no doubt it was the right thing to do. She said her plan was focused on \u201cshortening death rather than ending life,\u201d and ensuring \"the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world\".\n\nTo help make up her mind, Conservative MP Rebecca Paul interviewed her friend Dr David Montgomery\n\nRebecca Paul has now decided she is voting against the bill, telling the BBC the healthcare system is too stretched to ensure protection for vulnerable people. Asato, too, has decided to vote against, saying the bill lacks sufficient safeguards against coercion and she cannot support it. Asato understands her choice will disappoint parts of her community. \"I guess that is the beauty of a representative democracy - that you vote for your MP and then you put your trust and faith in that person to be able to weigh up all the evidence for a conscience vote,\" she says. Tomlinson, however, remains undecided, and will be using the act of writing his speech as the final step in what he calls \"the hardest decision of his political career\". But he says the free vote is \"good for our politics\" - allowing MPs to engage across party lines and creating space to think independently.",

In a thinly-veiled reference to China's claim over the island, Lai said he would \"uphold the commitment to resist annexation or encroachment upon our sovereignty.\" At the same time, Lai promised to maintain \"the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait\" and pledged to cooperate with Beijing on issues such as climate change, combating infectious diseases and maintaining regional security. Responding to Lai's speech, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it \"exposed his intransigent position\" on Taiwan independence.\n\nLai was speaking to a crowd in Taipei to commemorate Taiwan's National Day, only nine days after Communist China celebrated its 75th anniversary. \"The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinates to each other,\" he said, in a reference to the governments of Taipei and Beijing respectively. \"On this land, democracy and freedom are thriving.

Lai previously told visitors there would be \"no surprises\" in his national day address, in a bid to reassure them that he would not do anything further to agitate Beijing. The disclaimer followed several speeches by President Lai over the past few months that some viewed as being provocative. \"The speech was much softer and less snarky than his recent speeches,\" Lev Nachman, a political scientist at the National Taiwan University, told the BBC in reference to Thursday's address. \"It gives China far less ammunition to use against him.\" \"Nevertheless,\" he added, \"Beijing will still find many reasons to hate this speech.\" Mr Nachman said he expected a strong reaction from Beijing in the form of more military exercises in the next few days. Calling him \"intransigent\" on independence, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised Lai's speech and his \"sinister intention to escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait in order to seek political gains.\" \"No matter what the Lai Ching-te Administration says or does, it will not be able to change the objective fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same China, nor will it be able to stop the historical trend that China is bound to be reunified, and will be reunified eventually,\" Mao Ning told reporters on Thursday, using Lai's Chinese name. Last week, Lai said it was \"absolutely impossible\" for China to be the \"motherland\" of Taiwan because the island's government was founded in 1911, decades before the current Communist regime of mainland China was founded in 1949. \"On the contrary, the Republic of China may actually be the motherland of citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China who are over 75 years old,\" Lai said at a concert to mark Taiwan's National Day on Saturday. Taiwan maintains the constitution of the Republic of China, which was founded on the Chinese mainland. When it lost a long civil war with the Communists in 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan and has been based there ever since.\n\nLai spoke to a crowd in Taipei to commemorate Taiwan's National Day, only nine days after Communist China celebrated its 75th anniversary\n\nLast month, Lai also questioned China's assertion that its claim over the self-ruled island was based on territorial integrity. If that were the case, he suggested, Beijing would also be pushing to reclaim other so-called historic lands that once belonged to the Chinese empire. \"If China wants to annex Taiwan... it's not for the sake of territorial integrity,\" Lai said, in an interview to mark his first 100 days in office. \"If it is really for the sake of territorial integrity, why doesn't China take back Russia?\" Lai referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, which saw China concede large swathes of Manchuria to Russia. The concession occurred during what China refers to as the \"century of humiliation,\" when Western powers and Japan exploited the weakened Qing Dynasty. On Wednesday, China's government responded by saying President Lai was escalating tensions with \"sinister intentions\". \"Lai Ching-te's Taiwan independence fallacy is just old wine in a new bottle, and again exposes his obstinate stance on Taiwan independence and his sinister intentions of escalating hostility and confrontation,\" said the statement from China's Taiwan Affairs Office. After his election in January, Lai succeeded Taiwan's previous president Tsai Ing-wen, who also came from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Lai's public comments until now are regarded by many political observers as going further than anything said by his predecessor, who was much more cautious in her public speeches. In spite of his administration's more confrontational tone, however, Lai has stressed his position of maintaining the \"status quo\" between Taiwan and China. He insists Taiwan has no need to declare independence because it is already an independent sovereign nation that has never been controlled by the People\u2019s Republic of China. Lai also devoted a considerable amount of Thursday's speech to domestic issues such as energy, climate change and housing.",

    "Biden says US discussing possible Israeli strikes on Iran oil facilities\n\nJoe Biden has said the US is discussing with Israel the possibility of Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure. When asked if he would support such strikes, Mr Biden said: \"We're discussing that. I think that would be a little... anyway.\" His off-the-cuff remarks, made as he left the White House, did not make clear Washington\u2019s stance. Mr Biden has previously said he would not support Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The price of benchmark Brent crude oil shot up by 5% immediately after the remarks. It has now increased by 10% since Iran\u2019s large-scale missile attack on Israel on Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran \"will pay a heavy price\u201d for Tuesday\u2019s attack, which saw at least 180 ballistic missiles fired at Israel. Satellite imagery published by the Associated Press news agency showed damage to the Nevatim airbase, one of the targets of the attack. Iran said the barrage was a response to the killings of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps commander Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan. Mr Biden told reporters that he was not expecting Israel to launch its retaliation on Thursday. Asked as he left the White House what plans the US had to allow Israel to strike Iran, he responded: \"First of all, we don\u2019t allow Israel, we advise Israel and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to happen today.\" A US official told Reuters news agency the US believes Israel is \u201cstill determining what exactly they will do.\u201d Mr Biden earlier said the US did not support strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, as touted by some in Israel, including former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett. Bennett argued striking Iran's nuclear facilities could \"help change the face of the Middle East\" and \u201cfatally cripple this terrorist regime\u201d. Reports in Israeli media citing local officials suggest Israel plans to first strike Iran\u2019s oil facilities. If Iran then hits back, Israel will target its nuclear facilities. Speaking on Wednesday, Iran's chief of staff Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri told state TV that it would hit infrastructure across Israel if it retaliates. The barrage \"will be repeated with bigger intensity and all infrastructure of the regime will be targeted\", Mr Bagheri said. Mr Biden said on Wednesday he had consulted with the leaders of other G7 countries, who agreed Israel \"has the right to respond, but they should respond proportionally\". Fears over further violence between Israel and Iran, the world\u2019s seventh largest oil producer, have put markets on edge. Of particular concern is whether any escalation could block the Straits of Hormuz, through which a third of oil tanker traffic and a fifth of LNG frozen gas has to pass.",
    "The portrait of a former DUP lord mayor was on display at Belfast City Hall\n\nA Sinn F\u00e9in employee has resigned after admitting involvement in an incident where damage was caused to a portrait in Belfast City Hall. A painting of former lord mayor and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer Lord Wallace Browne was removed from a wall at the weekend and its glass \"smashed\". A Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson said the employee was \"immediately suspended\" and the police have been notified. The party said the employee, who worked in the assembly, had now resigned from their job and the party.\n\nIn a social media post, external, DUP leader Gavin Robinson said: \"We don't know if the motivation was sectarian bigotry, antisemitism, wanton destruction or a heady mix of the three... but [it's] a disgrace.\" DUP councillor Dean McCullough said the glass in the portrait's frame had been smashed. \"We have called for a full and robust investigation because there are a number of outstanding questions,\" he said. The council said it was \"assessing the extent of the damage and looking into the circumstances\". It added that it hoped the portrait could be repaired \"as soon as possible so the portrait can be put back on display\". The Police Service of Northern Ireland said at 16.50 BST on Monday, they received a report of criminal damage to artwork in Belfast City Hall which occurred on Saturday evening. They encouraged anyone with information to contact them.\n\nSaturday's incident comes days after a portrait of former Belfast Lord Mayor Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile was removed from City Hall. Party group leaders on the council agreed the move unanimously, it is understood. It followed revelations that Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile quit Sinn F\u00e9in after sending inappropriate texts to a teenage boy. Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald told the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) there were no findings of illegality and no criminal charges were pursued. The controversy concerning Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile shows no signs of abating, with McDonald saying on Monday that she will make \"a full, unequivocal apology\" to the teenager. The DUP's McCullough questioned whether the damage to the portrait was \"in any way linked\" to the \"rightful removal\" of Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile's portrait. \"It is worth highlighting that this particular portrait was painted by the renowned Jewish artist, Israel Zohar - again, raising another, serious question,\" he added.\n\nWallace Browne was lord mayor of Belfast from 2005 - 2006\n\nThe incident happened following an event at City Hall to celebrate an Irish language group's 20th anniversary. Gl\u00f3r na M\u00f3na said they were \"extremely disappointed\" to learn of the incident and would assist the council with its investigation. \"Following the formal end of our event, a portrait within city hall was damaged,\" it said. \"Gl\u00f3r na M\u00f3na had no knowledge of this taking place and only became aware of this on Monday 21 October when contacted by council staff. \"This is completely contrary to the ethos and principles of our organisation and the spirit of our successful anniversary celebratory event.\" Several senior Sinn F\u00e9in members were among those seen in pictures posted online from the city hall event. They included former party leader Gerry Adams and Aisling Reilly, a junior minister in the Northern Ireland Executive.",

    "Fiona Hyslop said the ferry network faced a difficult and challenging winter\n\nIslanders are facing a \"challenging and difficult\" winter because of potential disruption to ferry services, Scotland's transport minister has warned. Fiona Hyslop said Caledonian MacBrayne was under intense pressure because of a lack of available vessels - but that she was pushing the ferry operator to consider \"all options\" to maintain lifeline services. She was responding to an urgent question from one of her own backbenchers after it emerged the main Arran ferry MV Caledonian Isles may be out of action all winter. Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene accused the SNP of having a \"brass neck\" for blaming CalMac for problems it had created through years of underinvestment.\n\nHyslop told MSPs the latest delay to the return of Caledonian Isles - which has been out of action since January - was \"deeply frustrating and concerning\". \"Ministers and officials continue to push CalMac to ensure all options to expedite repairs are being considered,\" she said. She said CalMac was now looking at what it meant in terms of vessel redeployment across the entire west coast ferry network.\n\nNew problems with MV Caledonian Isles were found when it went into dry dock at Greenock\n\nShe said three options had been shared with island communities before route changes are announced next week. But CalMac had to balance the importance of the busy Arran route with the need to maintain lifeline services elsewhere, she added. \"That's the difficult balancing act in what is going to be a challenging and difficult winter,\" she said. \"We thought that last winter would be the period that would have caused most issue, and we should have seen at least the Glen Sannox vessel in by now.\"\n\nScottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene accused the SNP of having a \"brass neck\", saying the government was ultimately to blame for the problems, rather than CalMac. \"Let me tell you where the failures lie in this entire ferry scandal - it's right there on the SNP front benches,\" he said. \"That is the reason - the lack of investment, the lack of progress in new vessels. I haven't heard a single solution from the minister today on what CalMac is going to do to address this situation. \"They are completely out of vessels and they are completely out of options.\" Hyslop said that was untrue, and that CalMac still had options to maintain services.\n\nMV Caledonian Isles has been out of action since it went for annual maintenance in January\n\nThe west coast ferry operator is facing a perfect storm of problems as it tries to plan a winter schedule without two of the 10 major vessels it normally relies on. MV Caledonian Isles has been out of action since serious corrosion was discovered during annual maintenance in January, which required the removal of all its engines while repair work was carried out The 31-year-old ship returned from the Cammell Laird shipyard in Merseyside last month, but before it could carry passengers again, a new gearbox fault was detected which required several more weeks to fix. On Tuesday, CalMac revealed more problems had been discovered which could put the ship out of action until late March. Another large ferry, Hebridean Isles, will be retired later this month because it is no longer considered feasible to get it through its mandatory five-year survey. The long-delayed Arran ferry Glen Sannox, being built at the Ferguson shipyard, is three weeks past its latest delivery date.\n\nA new ferry Glen Sannox, pictured during its final sea trials, will serve the Arran route but a final delivery date is still awaited\n\nOnce delivered, CalMac will need six-and-a-half weeks of crew familiarisation trials plus an already-booked annual overhaul in December before it becomes operational. Several other vessels will have to be withdrawn from service for their scheduled winter maintenance work in the coming months. The arrival of the first of four new large ferries being built in Turkey has also been delayed until March next year. A plan to charter an extra large vessel, MV Ben-My-Chree, from the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company foundered last week when it was established the ship would be unable to berth safely at Brodick harbour on Arran in poor weather.\n\nCalMac is currently maintaining ferry services to Arran using the Ferguson-built MV Isle of Arran - nicknamed the \"Auld Trooper\" because it is 40 years old - and a catamaran MV Alfred which is being chartered at a cost of \u00a31m per month. Government-owned CaMac used to add a new large vessel to its fleet every two or three years, but since 2007 the role of ferries procurement has been the responsibility of a different state-owned company, CMAL. Since then only two large vessels have been delivered, MV Finlaggan in 2011 and MV Loch Seaforth in 2015. The dual-fual LNG ship Glen Sannox and its sister vessel Glen Rosa were both meant to be delivered in 2018. But design challenges and a bitter dispute between CMAL and the former Ferguson shipyard owners over costs resulted in the firm going bust and being nationalised. Much of the CalMac fleet is now beyond its expected service life. Fiona Hyslop pointed out that six new large vessels are under construction - including Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa which are both earmarked for the Arran route. CMAL has also begun the procurement process to replace seven small ferries, with the contract expected to be awarded next March.",

    "Angela Merkel defends ties with Russia and blocking Ukraine from Nato\n\nAngela Merkel sat down for a rare interview with the BBC's Katya Adler\n\nFormer German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told the BBC the gas deals she made with Russia were intended to help German firms and kept the peace with Moscow. She also insisted the war with Ukraine would have started earlier if she hadn\u2019t blocked Kyiv\u2019s entry into Nato in 2008. Angela Merkel led Germany for 16 years. She was in office during the financial crisis, the 2015 migrant crisis and, significantly, Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Was she too soft on Moscow? Too slow to help Kyiv? If she hadn't blocked Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership in 2008, would there be a war there now? Speaking to the BBC in Berlin, Mrs Merkel is robust in her defence of her time in office. She says she believes the war in Ukraine would have started sooner and would likely have been worse, if Kyiv had begun the path to Nato membership in 2008. \"We would have seen military conflict even earlier. It was completely clear to me that President Putin would not have stood idly by and watched Ukraine join Nato. \"And back then, Ukraine as a country would certainly not have been as prepared as it was in February 2022.\" He describes Mrs Merkel\u2019s Nato decision, backed by then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as a clear \"miscalculation\" that emboldened Russia.\n\nMrs Merkel was involved in several diplomatic initiatives that failed to achieve a lasting peace\n\nIn a rare interview since she stepped down from politics three years ago, Mrs Merkel expresses concern about Vladimir Putin\u2019s renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. The two leaders got to know each other well over the course of two decades. \"We must do everything possible to prevent the use of nuclear weapons,\u201d the former German Chancellor says. \"Thankfully, China also spoke about this a while back. We shouldn't be paralysed by fear, but we must also acknowledge that Russia is the biggest, or alongside the US, one of the two biggest nuclear powers in the world. Despite enjoying high popularity ratings during most of her time in office, Mrs Merkel now finds herself on the defensive. She has just published her memoir, Freedom. And the timing is interesting. She says she did everything in her power to ensure peaceful means of co-operation with Russia. In fact, Mr Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine just months after she left office. This prompted a thorough re-examination in Europe of energy policies, diplomacy with Russia and also migration policies that had become the norm under Mrs Merkel.\n\nAngela Merkel was seen as one of the few Western leaders who might be able to influence Russia's Vladimir Putin\n\nAt the helm of Europe\u2019s biggest economy, she was, as former Italian premier Matteo Renzi says, the de-facto leader of Europe - \"the boss of the European Union\". \"Do you remember when [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger used to say 'what is the telephone number of Europe?',\" he says. \"My answer was: clearly, the mobile number of Angela Merkel.\" He adds that when judging the Merkel legacy - over Russia and otherwise - it is important to remember the norms of the time. \"One cannot attack Angela for the relations with Russia,\" he says. \"In 2005, 2006 [they] were a goal of everyone in Europe, not only a goal of Angela Merkel.\" Under Mrs Merkel, Germany and its energy-hungry big industries became dependent on Moscow. Germany built two gas pipelines directly linked to Russia. President Zelensky described that cheap gas as a geopolitical tool of the Kremlin. Mrs Merkel tells the BBC she had two motives with the pipelines: German business interests but also maintaining peaceful links with Russia. Fellow EU and Nato members in eastern Europe strongly disagreed with her. The Polish MP, Radoslaw Fogiel, said German gas money filled Russia\u2019s war chest - used to fund the invasion of Ukraine. Mrs Merkel insists she tried to curb Russian attacks on Ukraine using diplomacy and negotiations, which - she admits - ultimately failed. And German industry has been disproportionately hit by sanctions on Russian energy. Forced to look for other suppliers, the country is now buying expensive LNG. Businesses says they are crippled by the costs. A new era in Europe\u2019s relations with Russia \"regrettably\" began following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, says Mrs Merkel. On Monday, defence ministers from the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy are meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation on Ukraine\u2019s frontlines.\n\nUS President Donald Trump strongly criticised Mrs Merkel for building two gas pipelines with Russia\n\nMs Merkel, 70, now finds herself having to defend her legacy in other areas too. The migration crisis of 2015, when she famously opened Germany\u2019s doors to over a million asylum seekers, was perhaps the defining moment of her time in office. It was hated by some, hailed by others. US President Barack Obama praised her as a courageous and moral leader. But critics blamed her for breathing life into the then almost redundant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. It is now polling comfortably in second place in German public opinion polls, ahead of a snap general election early next year. Angela Merkel admits the AfD made big gains, but she makes no apology for her political decisions. As for suggestions that her 2015 policies helped fuel anti-immigration and far-right parties elsewhere too, including the Netherlands, Poland and France, after she tried to impose migrant quotas across EU countries, Mrs Merkel says she can\u2019t be held responsible for all of Europe. The only way to combat the far right is to stop illegal migration, she says. She calls on Europe\u2019s leaders to invest more in African nations to improve standards of living there, so fewer people will be tempted to leave their homes. But with Europe\u2019s economies sluggish, and voters worried about the cost of living, governments say there is little cash to spare.\n\nAngela Merkel's Germany welcomed over a million refugees in 2015, at the height of the war in Syria\n\nAngela Merkel appeared to put her country and its economic interests first when it came to buying Russian energy or during the eurozone crisis - when southern EU nations blamed her for squeezing them with austerity measures in order to rescue German banks and businesses. But even at home in Germany, she is now accused of simply \"managing\" successive crises and failing to make far-reaching, perhaps painful reforms to future-proof her country and the EU. Germany is now labelled by some as \"the sick man of Europe\". Once an export powerhouse on the world stage, its economy hovers just above recession. Voters complain she failed to invest in roads, railways and digitalisation, in favour of maintaining a balanced budget. Under Angela Merkel, Germany not only became reliant on Russia for energy, but on China and the US for trade. Those decisions have not stood the test of time. Donald Trump threatens punishing tariffs on imports when he returns to the White House in January. Mrs Merkel does have some thoughts for Europe\u2019s nervous leaders faced with Trump 2.0. His first term in office was marked by anger at Europe, particularly Germany, over low defence spending and trade deficits. Those gripes with Europe haven't changed. What are the Merkel tips for handling him?\n\nMr Trump accused other Nato countries of not meeting their defence targets and threatened tariffs on EU exports, especially German cars\n\n\"It\u2019s really important to know what your priorities are, to present them clearly and not to be scared, because Donald Trump can be very outspoken,\" she says. \"He expresses himself very clearly. And if you do that, there is a certain mutual respect. That was my experience anyway.\" But Europe\u2019s leaders facing the US, China, and Russia, are apprehensive - arguably more so than during Angela Merkel\u2019s time. Economies are sluggish, voters unhappy, traditional politics under pressure from the far-right and the far-left. China and Russia are more bullish, the West weaker on the world stage. Wars burn in the Middle East and in Europe, with Donald Trump appearing less interested in bolstering European security. Perhaps that\u2019s why Angela Merkel says, these days, when world leaders she knows well call her for advice, she happily responds. But when I ask if she misses all that power and politics, her swift answer is: \"No, not at all.\" In the UK, you can watch Katya Adler's full interview with Angela Merkel on BBC iPlayer.",
    "Arran's main ferry could be out of service until late March\n\nThe MV Caledonian Isles could be out of service for over a year\n\nThe main Arran ferry - which has been out of action since February - may not return to service until next March, CalMac has confirmed. The ferry usually operates on the Ardrossan-Brodick route, but it was taken out of service earlier this year when significant repairs had to be carried out. CalMac said new problems had been uncovered on MV Caledonian Isles while the ship was in dry dock. No new date has been confirmed yet for its return to service, but the ferry operator warned that in a worst-case scenario it could miss the entire winter season.\n\nThe 31-year-old ship was originally due to return to service in September but a new gearbox fault was detected, which knocked its return date to mid-November. However, CalMac has now said the ship's stern tube bearings and eight steel frames need repaired or replaced. It said the ship's return date could not be confirmed yet, as there was uncertainty around the availability of a repair dock and the extent of the work required. The ferry operator warned that the MV Caledonian Isles could remain out of service until the end of the winter timetable in late March. CalMac will consult with island communities later this week on a revised vessel deployment plan for winter.\n\nCalMac\u2019s interim chief executive Duncan Mackison said the planned work was progressing well, but the the latest issues \"eliminated any chance of a return to service in the short-term\". He said: \u201cWe are in no doubt about the current challenges facing the network and the people who rely on it. We anticipated a challenging winter, and that is exactly what we\u2019re seeing play out. \"Any decisions we take around the service off the back of this news will cause disruption in places, and we will now consult with communities to get their valuable input into that service plan. \u201cOur recent efforts to add resilience to the service, such as through trialling third-party vessels and by bringing forward the drydock work for MV Caledonian Isles, will continue. We will leave no stone unturned as we try to meet the needs of the island communities we serve.\u201d CalMac now faces a winter season without two of the 10 major vessels it normally relies on to maintain services. The MV Hebridean Isles is due to be withdrawn from service later this month as it needs recertification and repair work is not economical.\n\nThe issues with the MV Caledonian Isles were discovered while it was in dry dock at Greenock.\n\nThe long-delayed Glen Sannox was due to be handed over last month, but some issues that arose during acceptance trials resulted in another delay. Once delivered, CalMac will carry out crew familiarisation trials and the ship will not carry passengers until January at the earliest. Other vessels will also be out of service for scheduled winter maintenance. The last time CalMac received a new large ship from ferries procurement company CMAL was in 2015, and many of its ships are now well beyond their expected service life. Last week CalMac looked into chartering MV Ben-My-Chree from the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, but berthing trials on the Arran route were unsuccessful. Services to Arran are currently being maintained by MV Isle of Arran - sometimes nicknamed the \"Auld Trooper\" as it entered service in 1984 - and the chartered catamaran Alfred. Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said the latest MV Caledonian Isles delay was \"yet another devastating blow for the residents of Arran and CalMac ferry users\". \u201cThe SNP\u2019s incompetence has left betrayed islanders with an ever-ageing vessel which is undergoing yet more lengthy repairs, whilst the new Glen Sannox is still nowhere to be seen,\" he said. \u201cThe continued absence of the Caledonian Isles will now impact the entire ferry network and, with the MV Hebridean Isles on its way to the scrap heap, there is simply no spare capacity in the network.\" CalMac has a winter deployment plan in place through until Friday 15 November and the new plan will take effect from Saturday 16 November. It will be published by Wednesday 13 November.",
    "Jordan Kukabu, 18, was described by his father as \"gentle with a pure heart\"\n\nA group of four attackers who used a \"fearsome\" machete to murder a teenager in east London have been given life sentences. Wazabakana Elenda Jordan Kukabu, known as Jordan, died after he was stabbed in the heart outside Dagenham Heathway Underground station in May 2023. Michael Tommy-Mbogba, 21, and Toluwaslase Odunewu,18, as well as a two teenagers aged 17 and 16 - who cannot be identified due to their age - were all found guilty of murder following a trial at the Old Bailey. During sentencing, Mr Kukabu's mother, Tantine Kukabu, said she never thought she would lose her son, \"let alone in such a brutal and painful way\".\n\nThe trial heard Mr Kukabu had arrived at the station with two associates when they were confronted by a heavily-armed group. Their car was surrounded as Mr Kukabu and his colleague Matthew Adekoya, 20, tried to escape. Mr Adekoya was chased and stabbed by the 17-year-old defendant, but managed to drive away. Mr Kukabu collapsed and died at the scene after being stabbed by Mbogba, the court heard.\n\nToluwaslase Odunewu for a minimum of 23 years (right) and Michael Tommy-Mbogba (left) was jailed for at least 29 years\n\nDuring sentencing, Judge Anuja Dhir told the four: \"This was a group attack in a public place in front of members of the public.\" The judge said although some of the group that had arrived with the victim had threatened violence, the response by the defendants to that behaviour \"was out of all proportion\". Judge Dhir told the defendants: \"Although the fatal injury was inflicted with a large machete in the hands of Mbogba, each of you played a part in the death of Jordan Kukabu.\"\n\nJudge Dhir said: \"You were not just carrying knives - there were four of you and you were carrying fearsome machete-style knives.\" She added: \"None of you have explained why you were together and why so heavily armed outside Dagenham Heathway Underground station.\" She sentenced Mbogba to a minimum of 29 years; Odunewu, at least 23 years; the 17-year-old for 23 years and the 16-year-old for 16 years. The court heard they were identified after one man had seen the defendants sitting on the top deck of a bus after the murder, re-enacting the fatal attack they had just carried out.\n\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Kukabu's mother, Tantine Kukabu, said: \"You took my precious son away. \"I would never have thought I would lose my son - let alone in such a brutal and painful way.\"\n\nMr Kukabu was described as possessing a beauty \"both inside and out\"\n\nHis father, Nzuzi Ilenda said his \"heart was crushed\" by the murder. \"My son possessed beauty both inside and out. \"He had a pure heart and was so gentle he would not harm anyone, yet his life was taken so prematurely. \"I can only visit Jordan\u2019s grave and mourn the loss of his beautiful presence to this world.\u201d\n\nThe 17-year-old defendant was also given a concurrent sentence of 13 years for the attempted murder of Mr Adekoya, and the three other defendants received lesser sentences for wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm against the same victim. All were also sentenced for violent disorder relating to an offence two days earlier and having an article with a blade or point.",
    "An X-ray of Isabella Ruxton's skull was a crucial piece of evidence in the case\n\nA search has been launched for the families of two women killed 90 years ago in the Jigsaw Murders, after their skulls were rediscovered in a university storeroom. The deaths of Isabella Ruxton and Mary Rogerson, whose bodies were found in Moffat, Dumfries and Galloway, made headlines around the world in 1935. The case broke new ground in forensic science when Edinburgh University helped build evidence against Dr Buck Ruxton, who was hanged for his wife\u2019s murder. The university has now discovered that the skulls and other bones are still in its archive. It is trying to trace the women's relatives to ask if they wish these to be returned.\n\nProfessor of anatomy Tom Gillingwater said: \"We want to do the right thing by Isabella and Mary and, if appropriate, return them to their families so they can be laid to rest.\" The university decided to issue a public appeal through the BBC instead of approaching the families privately, because it is not known whether Isabella and Buck Ruxton\u2019s three orphaned children were ever told that their father had been hanged for murdering their mother.\n\nThe two women were reported missing by Mary Rogerson's family\n\nThe killings - which became known as the Jigsaw Murders - took place in Lancaster in September 1935. Newspaper reporters flocked to Dumfries and Galloway after dismembered and disfigured human remains were discovered beneath a bridge over a stream near Moffat. The remains were sent to Edinburgh University, where forensic scientists and colleagues from Glasgow University pieced together the body parts. As they carried out their gruesome task, another investigation was under way in Lancaster, north west England. Dr Buck Ruxton had given various explanations for the disappearance of his wife Isabella and their nursemaid Mary Rogerson. The popular GP had been jealous of his wife's friendship with other men. She had accused him of domestic abuse before she vanished but local police had taken no action. Mary and Isabella were reported missing by Mary's family, not by Ruxton.\n\nRuxton stood trial five months after the bodies were found\n\nInvestigators in Scotland made the link between the two women and the remains which were found near Moffat. The bodies still had to be identified beyond doubt and their killer, who was known to have experience of surgery, had taken great care to make that as difficult as possible. Ruxton\u2019s efforts to avoid justice were defeated by groundbreaking forensic techniques which confirmed the remains were those of Isabella and Mary. The identification was crucial to the prosecution case in what was described as \"the trial of the century\u201d. Ruxton went into the dock at the Assize Court in Manchester five months after the bodies were found.\n\nA new technique for analysing fingerprints was used to identify Mary Rogerson\n\nThe jury was shown an image of Isabella that the scientists had superimposed on an X-ray of one of the skulls from the ravine - the first time such evidence had been used in court. They were a chilling match. The trial was told that a new technique for analysing fingerprints had been used to identify Mary. The scientists had also studied insects found on the bodies to establish the date of their deaths. Ruxton was convicted of murdering his wife. He had also been accused of killing Mary but the charge was dropped before the trial. Two months after he was found guilty, huge crowds gathered outside Manchester's Strangeways Prison when he was executed by hanging.\n\nCrowds gathered outside Strangeways Prison when Ruxton was executed\n\nFormer assistant chief constable Tom Wood has written a book on the case, entitled Ruxton: The First Modern Murder. \"It was one of the most important criminal investigations of the 20th Century, not because of the horror of the case and the dismemberment of the bodies, but because of the forensic science,\" he said. \"Put simply, anything before the Ruxton case was ancient history. Anything after the Ruxton case is modern, integrated, forensic science-led investigation.\u201d In the decades that followed, the women's bones were held in Edinburgh University's huge anatomical collection, stored in boxes in a vault alongside evidence from the case. The assumption is that they were retained for further medical research.\n\nTom Wood says it was one of the most important criminal investigations of the 20th Century\n\nProf Gillingwater and Tom Wood both argue that this decision should be viewed in the context of the ethical standards of the time. \"If you're asking me if I would have done the same thing with my 21st Century lens, absolutely not,\" said Prof Gillingwater. \"But at the time what those scientists did in this investigation was remarkable and revolutionary.\" Mr Wood believes it is unlikely the women\u2019s families knew they were holding funerals without all of their loved ones\u2019 remains. \"I can understand why they did it. These were men of science,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were men who were determined to improve criminal investigation and they would have used these body parts to do that. \u201cThis was not some cruel disregard. These remains were kept for the advancement of science.\"\n\nIsabella and Mary\u2019s remains had been kept in a university storeroom\n\nProf Gillingwater says the remains were \"found or re-found\" after a student in the Netherlands asked about the archive. \u201cThe overriding feeling was that OK, these are not perhaps being treated with the full level of care and respect that we would want,\u201d he said. The university was told by the Scottish government that its possession of the remains was legal \u2013 but it decided to establish whether they should be returned to the women\u2019s families. However, that created another dilemma. Isabella and Buck Ruxton\u2019s three young children were fostered and it is not known if they were ever told how their parents died. Mary Rogerson is known to have relatives in the Morecambe area, while Isabella's sister Jeannie Nelson was living in Edinburgh at the time of the murder.\n\nProf Tom Gillingwater has asked any relatives to contact the university\n\nAfter consulting experts on ethics, the university decided to issue an appeal through the BBC. \"The guidance was very clear, that we should not be approaching people who may not be aware that they were related to these ladies,\" said Prof Gillingwater. \"If there are any relatives of Isabella or Mary who believe that they would like to have the remains returned to them, we would be delighted to talk to them about what the next steps might be.\" The university says any discussions will be held in strictest confidence and the families should not feel under pressure to come forward. They can make contact through a section on the university's website, external.\n\u2022 None The Jigsaw Murders case where forensics were key",
    "Thomas Wei Huang, 17, from Malaysia, was detained for life to serve a minimum term of 12 years\n\nA schoolboy who attacked two students and a teacher with a hammer at a boarding school in Devon has been named after a judge lifted an order preventing his identification. Thomas Wei Huang, 17, from Malaysia, was detained for life to serve a minimum term of 12 years after he tried to kill three people at Blundell's School in Tiverton. He attacked two roommates, aged 15 and 16 at the time, as they slept during the early hours of 9 June 2023, leaving them with severe injuries. The teenager, who claimed he was sleepwalking during the attack, was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court in October after being found guilty of three counts of attempted murder.\n\nThe court heard Huang had an \"unhealthy interest in violence and violent films\"\n\nHe also attacked housemaster Henry Roffe-Silvester, who suffered six wounds to his head. Huang can be identified after a High Court judge lifted an order preventing publication of his name. A jury heard Huang, who was aged 16 at the time of the attack, used weapons he had collected to prepare for a zombie apocalypse. Sentencing, Judge Mrs Justice Cutts said: \"You knew the difference between right and wrong and you intended to kill those boys.\"\n\nThe teenager, who admitted assaulting the two boys and the housemaster, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder by reason of insanity due to his sleepwalking. The court also heard he had an \"unhealthy interest in violence and violent films\", and was struggling with a \"cocktail of extreme stress\" due to exam and personal life issues. But the jury rejected the sleepwalking argument. The two pupils were asleep in cabin-style beds in one of the co-educational school's boarding houses when Huang climbed up and attacked them shortly before 01:00. Mr Roffe-Silvester, who was asleep in his own quarters, was woken by noises coming from the boarding house and went to investigate.\n\nWhen he entered the bedroom where the attack had happened, he saw a silhouetted figure standing in the room, who then turned towards him and repeatedly struck him over the head with a hammer. The two boys were discovered in their beds a few minutes later and had suffered skull fractures and injuries to their ribs, spleen, a punctured lung and internal bleeding. The court heard both were living with the \"long-term consequences\" of the attack but have no memory of it. One boy suffered permanent brain damage, the court heard. Mr Roffe-Silvester, who received six blows to his head, made a full recovery.",
    "Lucy Letby, 34, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders in prison\n\nA doctor was told by hospital bosses to apologise to Lucy Letby over claims he called her a murderer more than two years before she was eventually arrested, a public inquiry has heard. Obstetrician Dr Jim McCormack was said to have made the remark during a meeting between medics and senior nursing staff after the sudden and unexpected deaths of two triplets at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit in June 2016. Giving evidence earlier at the Thirlwall Inquiry, which is examining how the nurse was able to murder and attack babies at the hospital, the now-retired doctor denied naming Letby. He said he did not know who she was until he was asked seven months later to apologise to her.\n\nDr McCormack said senior paediatricians had called a \"very unusual\" 07:30 meeting with obstetricians and senior neonatal nursing staff in response to the triplet deaths. He said neonatal lead consultant Dr Stephen Brearey told those gathered there was \"a concern that a nurse was causing intentional harm to babies upon the unit\". Dr McCormack said: \"I said: 'Are you saying that a nurse on the unit is a murderer?' And he replied: 'Yes.' \"We were absolutely shocked at this stage. Everybody was taken aback, certainly from an obstetric point of view.\" The first he said he knew there had been any concern at what he had said in the meeting was when he received a phone call from medical director Ian Harvey to go to his office. \"I walked into his office, sat down with him and he (Mr Harvey) said: 'You are going to have to make an apology to Lucy Letby.' \"Now, I didn't even know who Lucy Letby was. At that meeting of the paediatricians Steve Brearey didn't say the name of the person, nor whether it was male or female.\"\n\nThe inquiry is being chaired by Lady Justice Thirwall\n\nThe inquiry heard Mr Harvey informed him that his reported remark had been documented in an HR report related to a grievance procedure Letby took out over her removal from the neonatal unit in July 2016 to non-patient duties. Dr McCormack said: \"I told Mr Harvey that's not the case, it's definitely not the case. I said: 'You know, this isn't right that this is down in an official document.\"' The inquiry, chaired by Lady Justice Thirwall, has previously heard that seven consultants had already signed a joint letter of apology to Letby after hospital chief executive Tony Chambers told them they had \"upset\" the nurse by linking her to increased number of deaths on the unit. Dr McCormack said Mr Harvey told him Mr Chambers had \"insisted\" that he should also apologise in writing. He told the inquiry: \"I was in the position where the paediatricians had apologised and it had already been documented in an HR report so I'm not going to be able to be in a position to get out of this.\" On 8 March 2017 he wrote to Letby: \"I have been reported to have made an inappropriate comment during meetings with the consultants and senior nursing staff when discussing events related to the neonatal unit issue. \"I wanted to apologise to you if this caused you any distress. \"I am only aware recently that your first name is Lucy and I have specifically avoided knowing your identity or name to try and afford you some anonymity when you return to work in the neonatal unit. \"I have made no specific derogatory reference personally about yourself.\" Counsel to the inquiry Rachel Langdale KC asked: \"At the time, did you think you should have to be sending that letter?\" Dr McCormack said: \"No, I didn't. Not at all. \"I was surprised she accepted it because I was really saying nothing. I didn't actually apologise for calling her a murderer. In my letter I was very careful what I wrote.\"\n\nLucy Letby was a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital\n\nHe added it was \"extremely disappointing\" the hospital's HR department did not check with him whether there was any truth in the alleged comment about Letby. Dr McCormack said: \"I couldn't understand it. I asked Ian (Harvey) if he could he go back and address that with the HR team because there seemed to be something amiss... because I hadn't had an opportunity to discuss the situation in which the remark was made.\" Cheshire Police were not called in to investigate the increased mortality rate at the Countess of Chester until May 2017 as Letby continued to work there until her arrest in July 2018. Letby, 34, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. The inquiry is expected to sit at Liverpool Town Hall until early next year, with findings published by late autumn 2025.",

    "The Football Association has opened a safeguarding inquiry into a Premier League club boss, a year on from a BBC investigation. The investigation found that despite three women reporting the man to the police for alleged sexual offences, he remained in position at the club. One of the women told the BBC the FA had failed to protect women and girls by taking no action, despite her being under 16 at the time of the alleged incident. Following reports in Sports news publication The Athletic, the BBC has seen confirmation that the FA has now opened an inquiry of its own following a police decision to take no further action.\n\nA spokesperson for the national governing body said it does not comment on individual cases but it has \u201crobust safeguarding measures in place\u201d. In an email from the end of October, seen by the BBC, the FA invited one of the complainants, who we are calling Kate, to a meeting to discuss her experiences as part of their safeguarding investigation. The FA added that it will not be able to share with her any details of their investigations including any outcome reached once complete. Kate first contacted the FA in July 2023, where she told it she had reported the man to the police for a historical rape that she says happened when she was 15. However, she believes nothing was done by the FA until now. \u201cFootball authorities and [the] government seem to have turned a blind eye, deaf ear and chose to say and do nothing to protect females from the threats he poses to girls and women,\u201d she told the BBC in reaction to the news of an FA inquiry. While Kate is glad the investigation has been opened she says she has serious concerns about the lack of transparency about any action taken. \u201cWe need assurances that all females at the club are safe,\u201d she adds. The boss was also investigated in 2021 after an allegation that he sexually abused a different 15-year-old in the 1990s. No further action was taken in that case because of legislation which stated that if an offence of \"unlawful sexual intercourse\" took place between 1956 and 2004, and the alleged victim was a girl aged 13 to 15, she had to make a complaint within a year.\n\nThe BBC spoke to a third woman, who says in the late 90s she was locked in a room by the boss as he attempted to coerce her into sexual activity. She says this took place during a job interview when she was in her early 20s. All three investigations have now been dropped by the police. In November of last year the BBC found that seven out of 20 Premier League clubs have had players or bosses investigated by the police for sexual offences since 2020. FA regulations only cover how to respond to allegations of this nature if they occur within a \u201cfootball environment\u201d, or if concerns relate to children or vulnerable adults. Its policies allow the governing body to impose an interim suspension order blocking the individual from some or all activity within the game while it continues investigating. Such an order can be imposed where the FA receives information that causes it \"reasonably to believe that a person poses or may pose a risk of harm\". The new inquiry will be led by the FA's professional game safeguarding manager. A spokesperson for the national governing body said: \u201cWe investigate and assess all allegations and concerns about individuals who may pose a risk of harm to children and adults at risk in football and, where applicable, can impose proportionate safeguarding measures in accordance with FA safeguarding regulations.\u201d\n\nIf you have information about this story that you would like to share please get in touch.

    "Sir Chris Hoy performed the baton ceremony before the men's cycling sprint finals at this year's Paris Olympics\n\nSix-time Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy has announced that his cancer is terminal. In an interview with the Sunday Times,, external he says doctors have told him he has between two and four years to live. He told the Sunday Times that he had been diagnosed with primary cancer in his prostate, which had spread to his bones - meaning it was stage four. Later on Sunday, the legendary athlete said on Instagram, external that he was \"feeling fit, strong and positive\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he was \"in awe\" of Sir Chris's courage, positivity and \"wonderful message of hope\", adding that the \"whole nation will be cheering him on now\" and sending love.\n\nThe 48-year-old Scot revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with cancer. He had not previously disclosed the type of cancer. Sir Chris won six Olympic golds between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian behind Sir Jason Kenny's tally of seven. He retired from cycling in 2013 and in recent years has been a regular pundit and commentator as part of BBC Sport's cycling coverage. Sir Chris told the newspaper he has known for a year that his cancer is terminal. Tumours were discovered to his shoulder, pelvis, hip, spine and rib. Sir Chris told the newspaper: \"As unnatural as it feels, this is nature. \"You know, we were all born and we all die, and this is just part of the process. \"You remind yourself, aren't I lucky that there is medicine I can take that will fend this off for as long as possible.\" Sir Chris added: \u201cHand on heart, I\u2019m pretty positive most of the time and I have genuine happiness. This is bigger than the Olympics. It\u2019s bigger than anything. This is about appreciating life and finding joy.\u201d\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Streeting 'in awe' of Chris Hoy's courage and positivity\n\nAfter the Sunday Times article was published, he posted a message on Instagram saying: \"You may see in the news this weekend some articles about my health, so I just wanted to reassure you all that I'm feeling fit, strong and positive, and overwhelmed by all the love and support shown to my family and me. Onwards!\" There were many supportive comments and good wishes underneath the post, including from fellow former Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish who called Sir Chris a \"hero of a human being\". Olympic athlete Dame Kelly Holmes also commented \"sending love to you Chris\" and the British Cycling account left an emoji showing two hands making a heart symbol. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on X , externalhailed Sir Chris as \"a British sporting legend\" and said \"the whole country is behind him and his family\". Scores of other sporting names have sent well wishes too, including four-time Olympic gold medal rower Matthew Pinsent, external and two-time gold medal swimmer Rebecca Adlington, who told Sir Chris \"you continue to be my only role model\". Speaking on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Streeting added that Sir Chris was \"not the only person\" dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis, so had \"done the country such an enormous service\" by being open and positive. \"That's worth even more than the stack of Olympic gold that he's built up over his career,\" he continued. Streeting was diagnosed with cancer in 2021, aged 38, and had an operation to remove a kidney as part of his treatment. He announced he was cancer free later that year.\n\nSir Chris Hoy won gold at the men's sprint final at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in China.\n\nThe Olympian's cancer was discovered last year after a routine scan for shoulder pain - he thought he had injured himself while lifting weights at the gym - revealed a tumour. The athlete was with his wife Sarra when he was given his terminal diagnosis. The couple have two children, Callum and Chloe, who were aged nine and six at the time. Just before Sir Chris's tumour was discovered, Sarra had undergone scans that would later show she had multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease. Former prime minister Gordon Brown said that courage had \"defined\" Sir Chris's career and \"now characterises how Chris and Sarra both face their health diagnoses and embrace life\". Scotland's first minister John Swinney called Sir Chris \"a person of incredible courage\", sending him good wishes in an X post., external Edinburgh-born Sir Chris, who was first inspired to take up cycling by the famous BMX scenes in the film E.T., had won six Olympic, 11 world and 43 World Cup titles by the time he retired. The cyclist first won gold at the Athens Olympics in 2004, and went on to secure three more gold medals four years later in 2008 Beijing. He won two further golds in London 2012. Such was his prestige that he was chosen to be the flag bearer for Team GB at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics and then again at the opening ceremony for the London Olympics four years later. A stadium built in Glasgow for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was named in his honour. Talking to Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio 5 Live, Simon Richardson, editor of Cycling Weekly magazine, called Sir Chris \"the epitome of the Olympic champion\". Michael Hutchinson, a journalist and former professional cyclist, echoed that, calling the Olympic champion a \"talisman\" in an interview on 5 Live Breakfast. He added it was \"inspiring\" that Sir Chris had not showed \"an ounce of self-pity\" in announcing his diagnosis. Since retiring, Sir Chris has written several books for children alongside his contribution to BBC cycling coverage. He has also been writing a memoir for the last year, which is due to be published next month. This week he has been appearing on BBC Two, co-presenting the coverage of the World Track Championships with Jill Douglas in Denmark.",
    "Christina Harrhy had been chief executive of Caerphilly council since 2018\n\nA cash-strapped council has agreed a \u00a3209,000 settlement to pay off its chief executive who has been absent for nearly a year. Sources have told BBC Wales that members of Caerphilly council met in secret on Monday evening to agree a pay-out for Christina Harrhy, who has not worked at the authority since last November. The authority is trying to save \u00a345m from its budget over the next two years and has faced rows over plans to close a museum and an arts venue. The council confirmed that Ms Harrhy, who was appointed in 2018 and had a salary of \u00a3148,773 in 2022-23, had left the authority and her deputy Dave Street had taken over.\n\nIt confirmed a meeting took place to discuss a \"confidential employment issue\" and it \"would not be appropriate to disclose the details of the meeting\". The Welsh Conservatives said the council should be transparent about such a large payment, saying it was a \"kick in the teeth\" for residents. A major union said council workers will be \"deeply disappointed\" when finances were extremely tight. It is not the first time the council has had to settle with a chief executive. In 2021 the authority gave its former chief executive Anthony O\u2019Sullivan, who was sacked in a pay row and had been away for work on paid gardening leave, external for a number of years, a \u00a397,500 pay-out. At Monday's meeting the council said Ms Harrhy had been absent since November 2023 due to sickness. She was assessed to be fit for work in January. It is understood that, while she was off sick and after she was found fit to return, she raised concerns about working relationships and trust relating to Labour leader Sean Morgan and a senior officer. Sources said an independent investigation that reported in the summer allegedly did not stand up the claims.\n\nIt is not clear what happened between the chief executive and Mr Morgan, and the BBC understands that councillors have been warned against speaking about the meeting publicly. The settlement is made up of 10 months' salary - costing taxpayers \u00a3146,000 - payment in lieu of notice of \u00a343,800 and accrued annual leave of \u00a319,200. Officials were said to have argued that the cost of a settlement was cheaper than going through a further investigation and facing a tribunal. The sources told the BBC that the settlement was voted through by the council's governing Labour group. The authority recently took the controversial decision to at least temporarily close Llancaiach Fawr Manor, a Tudor mansion and museum after spending \u00a3500,000 a year subsidising the site. It has also proposed mothballing Blackwood Miners' Institute.\n\nA source said: \"I think people have been asked to put up with a lot with queries on changing services. \"I think there will be an outpouring of unhappiness from the public. This is not the way to run an authority.\" Ms Harrhy confirmed she had left the council but declined to comment. A Caerphilly council spokesman said: \"A special meeting of council took place on Monday 7 October to discuss a confidential employment issue. It would not be appropriate to disclose the details of the meeting. \"We can confirm that Christina Harrhy has left the authority and that the deputy chief executive, Dave Street, will act as interim chief executive while the council considers the next steps in terms of appointing a permanent chief executive.\" Asked if the payments to the chief executive would need to be detailed in the council\u2019s annual accounts, the spokesman added that it would. The next set is due before June 2025.\n\nSenedd Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said on social media network X: \"At a time when services are being cut and council tax is going up, Caerphilly residents will view this as a kick in the teeth.\" Unison Caerphilly branch secretary Lianne Dallimore said: \u201cThe council says finances are extremely tight. \"People are losing their jobs with more redundancies on the way, and community services are being slashed. \u201cThat makes it all the more painful for staff and residents affected to hear the authority is making such a payout when times are so tough. Council workers and members of the public will be deeply disappointed.\u201d",
    "Ten Hag wishes Man Utd 'trophies and glory' after 'end of dream'\n\nErik ten Hag's 54.6% win record is the second best of any Manchester United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement \u2013 behind only Jose Mourinho's 58.3%\n\nErik ten Hag says he wishes Manchester United fans \"nothing but success, trophies and glory\" after he was sacked on Monday. The 54-year-old was dismissed following last weekend's 2-1 Premier League defeat at West Ham, and United have appointed Sporting boss Ruben Amorim as the Dutchman's permanent successor. Ten Hag, who won two trophies in as many seasons at United, thanked supporters in a statement released by his representatives SEG. \"Thank you for always being there for the club,\" he said. \"Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable. The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. \"I also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad.\"\n\nThe former Ajax manager took charge in the summer of 2022, ending the club's six-year wait for silverware by winning the Carabao Cup and achieving a third-placed finish in the Premier League in his first season. Ten Hag also led United to an FA Cup final victory over neighbours Manchester City in May, but the club finished a disappointing eighth in the league. He was sacked following a poor start to the 2024-25 campaign, leaving United 14th after nine games. \"We won two trophies - achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life,\" added Ten Hag. \"Of course my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end. \"I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. \"Your support, and the warmth I received from everyone at the club, helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.\" United confirmed on Friday that 39-year-old Portuguese coach Amorim will move to Old Trafford from Lisbon club Sporting on 11 November, on a contract until June 2027. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took charge on an interim basis after Ten Hag was sacked on Monday, will stay on for the club's next three fixtures.",
    "Could the deaths of 20 school children help make Thailand's roads safer?\n\nTwenty school children died on board the bus, along with three teachers\n\nThailand is a country in shock: three days ago, 20 children and three teachers were killed when their bus was engulfed in flames. It was one of the South East Asian country\u2019s worst road accidents, and investigators have uncovered a series of safety failures which some have suggested effectively turned the vehicle into a \u201cbomb on wheels\u201d. It has left the country - still mourning the loss of the 23 on board the bus - wondering how this was ever allowed to happen, and if it could happen again?\n\nVideo taken of the bus, after the driver had collided with a concrete barrier and come to a stop, showed jets of fire shooting up from underneath the vehicle and turning it into an inferno within minutes, giving the passengers in the rear no chance of escape. Investigators found the bus, which was converted to run on compressed natural gas (CNG), had six gas cylinders legally installed in the rear. But they also found five more illegally fitted under the front of the bus. The investigation found that a pipe coming from one of those in the front broke in the impact, leaking gas which ignited the fire. The trapped passengers appear to have been unable to open the rear emergency exit too, although it is not clear yet why. The government responded by ordering all of the more than 13,000 public and private buses powered by CNG to come in for inspection, and suspended all long-distance school bus trips. But the conversion to CNG was just one of many alterations made since the bus was first registered in 1970. It was a kind of \"franken-bus\", with new bodywork added several times, and only parts of the chassis remaining from the original. It had once been a double-decker, but - when new regulations imposed height limitations on these because of their propensity to overturn in an accident - it was converted into a single-decker. Passengers were seated on the upper deck, with the lower deck used to accommodate all the gas cylinders. Social media users have likened the bus to a bomb on wheels.\n\nThis is despite Thailand's gradual introduction over the past 15 years of regulations for bus safety laid out by the UNECE, the UN Economic Commission for Europe, a body responsible for establishing international standards in many areas. But application of these rules have been slow and piecemeal. \u201cThe problem is most of the manufacturers in Thailand cannot reach that standard,\u201d says Sumet Ongkittikul, a transport specialist at the Thailand Development Research Institute. \u201cSo the implementation has been delayed, to allow them to catch up. \u201cAlso, the regulations only apply to new buses. But most of the buses operating in Thailand are old.\" Modifying old bus chassis with new bodywork is a local industry, where safety standards are for the most part far behind those in many other countries. It is thought that at least 80% of the buses connecting Thailand\u2019s cities are in this older, adapted category. \u201cA new bus, from a good manufacturer, is very expensive,\u201d Sumet Ongkittikul explains. \u201cSo they use an old chassis, and a local manufacturer to build new bodywork, and that is counted only as an old bus, where the new regulations do not apply.\u201d For example, UNECE regulation UN R118, which requires bus interiors to be made with non-flammable materials, was officially introduced in Thailand in 2022, but does not apply to buses made before then, or buses adapted using older chassis. Less flammable materials might have helped mitigate the bus fire on Tuesday. And even the very limited regulations which did apply to the ill-fated bus appear to have been broken. According to the police, the bus was inspected in May this year, but they believe the illegal addition of gas cylinders was made after that. Two days after the accident, the police say they caught the bus owner trying to remove improperly installed gas cannisters from the five other buses. The company has had its licence to run buses suspended, and the owner has been charged with causing death through negligence, with other criminal charges being considered. But will this accident finally bring about a change in Thailand\u2019s dire road safety record?\n\nThailand saw an average of more than 17,000 road deaths each year for a decade\n\nThe country is currently on its fifth National Road Safety Master Plan, but with little progress to show for it. For years, it has sat in the top 10 countries with the highest per capita road fatalities. At times, it has been number two. Data from the TDRI found that over the 10 years to 2023, an average of 17,914 people died from road accidents per year. In the UK, which has a similar population, fatalities are 10 times lower. Anyone who travels regularly on Thai roads will be familiar with the dangerous behaviour habitually exhibited by many drivers. Exceeding the speed limit is commonplace and rarely punished. Cars weave in and out of traffic, leaving little margin for error. Commercial vehicles are often overloaded, badly designed and poorly lit. Motorbike riders routinely fail to wear helmets, far more than in neighbouring countries. Some blame corruption in the police force. Others blame the Buddhist belief in karma, putting misfortunes like car accidents down to bad luck rather than bad habits. Although there are posters graphically warning of the dangers of drinking and driving, there has also not been a sustained road safety campaign mounted by any Thai government. Some researchers believe this is because most fatalities, on motorbikes and on public buses, affect lower income groups, and not the policymakers who usually drive, or are driven, in high-end cars with high safety levels.\n\nBut attempts to improve the death toll appear to have made little impact so far\n\nFor all of the appalling statistics, road safety is not seen as an urgent issue, and gets little attention from the public. There have been plenty of equally horrific accidents before involving long-distance buses, yet they are little safer today than they were 10 years ago. Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit has announced a special committee to look into all aspects of road safety following Tuesday's fatal accident, but it has been greeted with little fanfare or enthusiasm. If this initiative really does bring about meaningful improvements, and bring down the annual death toll, it will break the pattern of ineffectual measures which have characterised nearly all of Thailand\u2019s road safety efforts to date.",

    "A week of massive changes in Ukraine war - and why they all matter\n\nThe war reached its 1000th day this week\n\nThe stakes have never been higher in the Ukraine-Russia war. In the week that saw the conflict pass its 1000th day, Western powers substantially boosted Ukraine's military arsenal - and the Kremlin made its loudest threats yet of a nuclear strike. Here is how the last week played out - and what it means.\n\nLate on Sunday night, reports emerged that outgoing US President Joe Biden had given Ukraine permission to use longer-range ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia. The move marked a major policy change by Washington - which for months had refused Ukraine\u2019s requests to use the missiles beyond its own borders. After the decision was leaked to the press, a volley of ATACMS missiles were fired by Ukraine into Russia\u2019s Bryansk region. The Kremlin said six were fired, with five intercepted, while anonymous US officials claimed it was eight, with two intercepted. Whatever the specifics, this was a landmark moment: American-made missiles had struck Russian soil for the first time in this war. Then on Wednesday, Ukraine launched UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia\u2019s Kursk region - where Ukrainian troops have seized a roughly 600-sq km (232 sq mile) patch of Russian territory. Later in the week, Biden added the final element of a ramped-up weapons arsenal to Ukraine by approving the use of anti-personnel landmines. Simple, controversial, but highly-effective, landmines are a crucial part of Ukraine\u2019s defences on the eastern frontline - and it is hoped their use could help slow Russia's advance. With three swift decisions, over a few seismic days, the West signalled to the world that its support for Ukraine was not about to vanish.\n\nIf Ukraine\u2019s western allies raised the stakes this week - so too did Moscow. On Tuesday, the 1000th day of the war, Putin pushed through changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The doctrine now says an attack from a non-nuclear state, if backed by a nuclear power, will be treated as a joint assault on Russia. The Kremlin then took its response a step further by deploying a new type of missile - \"Oreshnik\" - to strike the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Putin claimed it travelled at 10 times the speed of sound - and that there are \"no ways of counteracting this weapon\". Most observers agree the strike was designed to send a warning: that Russia could, if it chose, use the new missile to deliver a nuclear weapon.\n\nThousands ran for cover as \"Oreshnik\" was launched at Dnipro on Thursday morning\n\nSuch posturing would once have caused serious concern in the West. Now, not so much. Since the start of the conflict nearly three years ago, Putin has repeatedly laid out nuclear \"red lines\u2019\" which the West has repeatedly crossed. It seems many have become used to Russia\u2019s nuclear \u201csabre-rattling\u201d. And why else do Western leaders feel ready to gamble with Russia\u2019s nuclear threats? China. Beijing has become a vital partner for Moscow in its efforts to soften the impact of sanctions imposed by the US and other countries. China, the West believes, would react with horror at the use of nuclear weapons - thus discouraging Putin from making true on his threats.\n\u2022 None What we know about Russia's Oreshnik missile\n\nIn a rare televised address on Thursday evening, the Russian president warned that the war had \"acquired elements of a global character\". That assessment was echoed by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said \"the threat is serious and real when it comes to global conflict\". The US and UK are now more deeply involved than ever - while the deployment of North Korean troops to fight alongside Russia saw another nuclear power enter the war. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Thursday that \"never before\" has the threat of a nuclear war been greater, blaming the US for its \"aggressive and hostile\" policy towards Pyongyang.\n\nIt is believed North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia's Kursk region\n\nSo, why are we seeing these developments now? The likely reason is the impending arrival of US President-elect Donald Trump, who will officially enter the White House on 20 January. While on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the war within \u201c24 hours\u201d. Those around him, like Vice President-elect JD Vance, have signalled that will mean compromises for Ukraine, likely in the form of giving up territory in the Donbas and Crimea. That goes against the apparent stance of the Biden administration - whose decisions this week point to a desire to get as much aid through the door as possible before Trump enters office. But some are more bullish about Ukraine\u2019s prospects with Trump in power.\n\nZelensky has said the war will likely \"end sooner\" with Donald Trump in office\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said himself Kyiv would like to end the war through \u201cdiplomatic means\u201d in 2025. Former Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told the BBC this week: \u201cPresident Trump will undoubtedly be driven by one goal, to project his strength, his leadership... And show that he is capable of fixing problems which his predecessor failed to fix.\u201d \u201cAs much as the fall of Afghanistan inflicted a severe wound on the foreign policy reputation of the Biden administration, if the scenario you mentioned is to be entertained by President Trump, Ukraine will become his Afghanistan, with equal consequences.\" \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think this is what he\u2019s looking for.\u201d This week's developments may not be the start of the war escalating out of control - but the start of a tussle for the strongest negotiating position in potential future talks to end it.",
    "Family tells of 'relief' after 1924 climber\u2019s foot found on Everest\n\nIt was the call the family of a young British climber who went missing on Everest 100 years ago had given up hope of ever getting. Last month, a team of climbers filming a National Geographic documentary stumbled on a preserved boot, revealed by melting ice on a glacier. This boot was believed to belong to Andrew Comyn \"Sandy\" Irvine, who disappeared while attempting to climb Everest in June 1924 with his partner George Mallory. What's more, it could potentially help solve one of mountaineering's biggest mysteries: whether or not the pair succeeded in becoming the first people to reach the summit, 29 years before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.\n\nWell-known adventurer Jimmy Chin, who led the team for National Geographic, hailed the discovery of the boot - with a foot inside it - as a \"monumental and emotional moment\". But for Irvine's great-niece Julie Summers it was simply \"extraordinary\". \"I just froze.... We had all given up any hope any trace of him would be found,\" she told the BBC. A number of people have searched for Irvine's body over the years, partly because the 22-year-old is said to have been carrying a camera with an undeveloped film inside, potentially with a photograph of the pair at the summit. Could the discovery of the boot be the first step to finding his body - and the camera? The family have now given a DNA sample to help confirm the foot is indeed Irvine - but the filmmaking team is fairly confident it belongs to the mountaineer. The sock found inside the boot has a name tag stitched into it with the words \"A.C. Irvine\". \"I mean, dude... there's a label on it,\" Chin, who is known for making Oscar-winning climbing documentary Free Solo alongside his wife, was quoted as saying in a National Geographic report, external.\n\nThe team made the discovery as they descended the Central Rongbuk Glacier by the north face of Everest in September. Along the way, they found an oxygen bottle marked with the date 1933. An Everest expedition that year had found an item belonging to Irvine. Energised by this possible sign that Irvine's body could be nearby, the team searched the glacier for several days, before one of them saw the boot emerging from melting ice. It was a fortuitous find - they estimated the ice had only melted a week before their discovery. The foot has since been removed from the mountain because of concerns that birds were disturbing it, according to reports, and passed to the Chinese mountaineering authorities who govern the north face of Everest. For Irvine's descendants, the discovery has been emotional - especially in this, the centenary year of his disappearance. Summers had grown up hearing stories of her grandmother's adventurous, Oxford-educated younger brother, who they knew as \"Uncle Sandy\". \"My grandmother had a photo of him by her bed until the day she died,\" she recalled. \"She said he was a better man than anyone would ever be.\"\n\nSandy Irvine, as he was popularly known, was 22 when he went missing\n\nBirkenhead-born Irvine was just 22 when he disappeared, the youngest member of an expedition that has intrigued the mountaineering world for a century. He and Mallory were last seen alive on 8 June 1924 as they set off for the peak. Mallory's body would not be found until 1999 by an American climber. In recent decades, the search for the climbers' remains has been mired in controversy amid suspicions that the bodies were moved, external. Summers has always dismissed those stories and suspicions, revealing her feeling of \"relief\" following the Chin's call that \"he was still there on the mountain\". But what if it could now be proved that Irvine and Mallory reached the summit, becoming the first to do so - an idea which, Summers acknowledged, would \"turn mountaineering history onto its head\"? \"It would be nice - we would all feel very proud,\" she said. \"But the family has always maintained the mystery, and the story of how far they got and how brave they were, was really what it was about.\" And anyway, she said, \"the only way we will ever know is if we find a picture in the camera he was believed to be carrying\".\n\nThe last picture of Mallory (left) and Irvine (right) before they left for their climb in 1924\n\nThe search, she suspects, will now continue for that camera. \"I think it will be irresistible,\" she said. Whether it will be found remains to be seen. Chin, meanwhile, is hoping that the boot's discovery - \"a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground\" - will \"finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large\". For Summers, it is a chance to remind the world about a young man \"who took life and lived it\", embracing every opportunity - and above all, was \"having fun\". But perhaps surprisingly, she and her cousins are grateful the older generation were not here for this discovery. \"For them, Everest is his grave,\" she explained.",
    "Number of homeless people in Wales at record high\n\nCharmaine Denton is among the 6,447 households living in temporary accommodation in Wales\n\nCharmaine Denton has been waiting more than two years for a permanent home and she is far from the only one. The 38-year-old is \"scratching at the door\" to move after three years in supported housing, which she said had affected her mental health and left her feeling like her life was on hold. Homelessness is at a record level in Wales and the number using temporary accommodation, such as B&Bs, has risen by 18% to 6,447 in 2023-24. Charmaine, from Carmarthenshire, said: \"I was hoping to put up my own Christmas tree this year. I just want somewhere to call home - that's what everyone deserves, isn't it?\"\n\nShe moved into care when she was three and had a chaotic childhood. By 14 she was living in temporary accommodation and had her first flat two years later. \"I wasn't ready to be self-reliant and run my own property. I don't think many 16-year-olds are,\" she said.\n\nShe takes full responsibility for her actions but said a lack of support and a life of chaos led to her taking heroin and crack cocaine. \"You don't recognise you're going to be really heavily into drugs when you're 16, you just think it's one big party.\"\n\nShe lost her flat, went to prison, slept on the streets and lived in temporary accommodation. \"It was hard trying to stay clean there. I'm not blaming anyone, but there's only so much you can keep away from it when people are fighting in the hallway and they're up at three in the morning, knocking your door flat out.\" Charmaine now lives in a shared recovery-focused house run by homeless charity, The Wallich. Hers is one of nine rooms with a bathroom and kitchenette and she is proud to have changed her life and wants to give something back.\n\n\"My past made me stronger, I don't look at it as bad - I look at it as experience. I'm hoping I can turn it round into a positive,\" she added. She wants to continue voluntary work but cannot until she finds a permanent home. This year will be her fourth Christmas in temporary accommodation.\n\nJamie-Lee Cole from The Wallich said Charmaine's situation was an example of the bottleneck in temporary accommodation where there was a \"swelling\" of people needing it but with nowhere to move them on to. She said as well as the effect on Charmaine's mental health, for some there was a risk of relapse or reoffending.\n\nHomelessness is currently at the highest level since 2015, external - 13,539 households in 2023-24, up 8% in a year. The Bevan Foundation think tank said, external one in every 215 households and six in every 1,000 children now live in temporary accommodation.\n\nNewport, the fastest-growing city in Wales, has the highest homeless rate in the country - it has risen by more than 50% over the past year to a record 1,359 households. In September 2024, 594 households lived in temporary accommodation at a cost of \u00a36.5m to the city's council, up \u00a31.4m on the previous year.\n\nHousing advice and prevention officer for Newport City Council, Hannah Berry, said that each day is different at the housing options drop in service\n\nThursday mornings are busy at the housing drop-in service at Newport Central Library. Housing advice and prevention officer Hannah Berry said: \"People can be very angry, upset, frustrated... they just want a home.\" She said the hardest part of the job was turning people away \"We do our very best to help everybody, but we're restricted by budget, lack of housing, lack of provision and lack of other services.\" As a mother herself, she said it was particularly difficult to see families with children \"facing the toughest thing in their lives\".\n\nKath Howells, service manager for housing at Newport council, said it was the most challenging time in the 20 years she has worked in the sector\n\nKath Howells from Newport council said Wales was feeling the brunt of the housing crisis, with private rented homes too expensive for most people and a lack of other options. She said high demand and a very low turnover of housing association stock meant they could not \"move people into the homes they need and deserve\". She encouraged people at risk of losing their home to speak to the council as quickly as possible.\n\nSteffan Evans from The Bevan Foundation, external said the percentage of social homes as the total of the housing stock had almost halved in 40 years. \"We know that the Welsh government has got its 20,000 affordable homes target... but that target can't be the end, we need to go further than that,\" he said.\n\nThe Welsh government said tackling homelessness was a priority and it had \"allocated record levels of funding\" since 2021 - \u00a31.4bn - and was investing nearly \u00a3220m in homelessness prevention and housing support this year. A spokesman added: \"The increase in people being supported with temporary accommodation reflects the ongoing pressures within the system and the effects of the cost-of-living crisis on individuals and households.\"",

    "An agreement with Mauritius over control of the Chagos Islands is opposed by some people with Chagossian heritage in the UK\n\nBritain's decision to relinquish control of the Chagos Islands does not signal a change in the government's position on other overseas territories, Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said. He told the Commons the status of the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and other British Overseas Territories are \"not up for negotiation\". It comes after the government announced it would give up sovereignty over a cluster of remote Indian Ocean islands, a move which follows years of diplomatic talks and international pressure on the UK to resolve their disputed status. Meanwhile, Chagossians who oppose the deal to hand control of the islands to Mauritius have staged a protest outside Parliament.\n\nLammy described the deal with Mauritius - which has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968 - as a \"historic moment\" and a \"victory for diplomacy\". A key component of the deal announced last week, which is expected to be ratified in 2025, will allow the UK and US to continue to operate a strategically located military base on one of the islands, Diego Garcia. While the UK's move to renounce claims to the Chagos Islands has received praise internationally, including from the US, critics say it could embolden governments which claim sovereignty over other British Overseas Territories.\n\nLammy told the Commons the particular circumstances around the Chagos Islands are \"not comparable\" to other territorial disputes, in particular Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands - which the Spanish and Argentine governments respectively claim rights over. \"The government remains firmly committed to modern partnerships with our overseas territories based on mutual consent,\" he added. Tory shadow foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell criticised the agreement, saying it gives \"succour to our enemies in a dangerous world, and undermines the strategic web of Britain's defence interests\". Soon after the deal was announced, the Argentine government restated its claim to the Falkland Islands. The British governor of the islands reassured its people about the deal and said the \"UK's unwavering commitment to defend UK sovereignty remains undiminished\" in light of the Chagos Islands agreement. While Britain has apologised for the forcible removal of around 1,000 Chagossian islanders in the 1960s, many of the island's diaspora do not support Mauritius's territorial claims. Some Chagossians who live in the UK say they were not consulted on the recent agreement. A group gathered in Westminster while Lammy made his statement.\n\nIngrid from Crawley said: \u201cIt was like somebody stabbed you from behind. Our heart was broken because they just took the decision. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a say, it\u2019s as if we don\u2019t count. We are just like their puppets. Where are our human rights?\u201d Bertrice Pompe from Clapham Junction said Chagossians had been very poorly treated, adding \u201cto them, we are not human\u201d. She continued: \u201cI\u2019d love to go back... I\u2019d love to go there for longer than one week. \"The UK is not my country but I have to be here just to try get back to where I belong.\u201d Mylene Augustin from Crawley demanded the government \"stop the suffering\", adding: \"Let my people, let us decide for our future. \"This is our island, this is our heritage.\"",
    "Why the clocks have gone back and this landmark is still wrong\n\nThe Balmoral Hotel clock is in the heart of Edinburgh\n\nAs people across the UK roll their clocks back to GMT on Sunday, there's one well-loved Scottish clock that will remain at the wrong time. Ever since the Balmoral Hotel clock tower was built in Edinburgh 122 years ago, its time has deliberately been set fast. The peculiar tradition began after intervention by railway officials at Edinburgh Waverley Station, below the clock tower. In the era before mobile phones, when watches were expensive, the clock was well-used by train passengers to watch their time. Officials thought three extra minutes would give travellers more time to collect their tickets, reach their carriages and unload their luggage before the whistle blew. It has been set three minutes fast ever since.\n\u2022 None When do the clocks go back?\n\nBrian Duncan, chief engineer of the Balmoral Hotel, said the tradition would endure. At 02:00 the clock will be stopped for an hour, and set running again the usual three minutes ahead of time. \"Passersby don't seem to notice as we've never had a complaint about the time being wrong during that hour,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"I think it's because it's happening in the middle of the night.\" The Scottish Baronial-style clock tower was manually changed for daylight savings before it was automated in 2014 - just a few months after Brian took the job of looking after the clock. The change was prompted after it stopped three times over a six week period. Brian said one of the hundreds of cogs inside the original mechanism was slipping. \"I had to make a very big decision - do we continue with the clock being faulty or do we go for a small gear box controlled by a computer,\" he said.\n\nBrian Duncan said he would always keep the clock running three minutes fast\n\n\"We now have a very small gear box compared to the original mechanism and a computer controls it.\" So Brian will be sleeping in his bed when the clocks change. The hands on the four faces of the clock tower cannot be wound, so instead the clock is stopped for one hour in autumn and for 11 hours when the clocks go forward in the spring. \"It's always a Saturday night, so people on Princes Street at that time have usually had a few drinks so no-one really notices,\" he said. The only day the clock tells the true time is during the countdown to the midnight bells during Edinburgh's big Hogmanay celebrations on 31 December. The hotel pays for specialists from Smith of Derby to change the time for just one day to see in the New Year. Then it is set three minutes fast again.\n\nSquare lights inside the tower illuminate the clock face from behind so passersby can see the time more clearly at night\n\nThe 62-year-old also explained how the clock keeps its time during the year despite the forces of gravity on the minute hand. \"I was told the weight of gravity makes it faster for the first 30 seconds but then gravity makes it slower on the way back up so it equals out,\" he said. The last time the clock broke down was for more than a month in the summer of 2020 during the Covid lockdown. He now always looks up at it in the morning from his tram journey to work to make sure it is still working. The clock tower, which was designed by William Hamilton Beattie, rises 190ft (58m) into the capital's skyline. The original mechanism, although not used any more, is still in the clock tower. Brian said he hopes one day to have it moved into a more public area of the hotel so visitors can see it. \"It's a massive operation to take it out of the clock tower due to its sheer weight. It's made of steel and weighs at least half a ton.\"\n\nThe Balmoral Hotel clock has four faces\n\nThe Balmoral is the second most famous clock in the UK after Big Ben. \"I love the clock and I'm very proud to be in charge of looking after it,\" said Brian. \"It's quite an achievement to be the chief engineer of such a clock. \"And it gives me a wee bit of excitement when I look up at it, it's beautiful.\" The Balmoral Hotel is itself a landmark in Edinburgh. It opened originally as the North British Station Hotel. It was re-named the Balmoral - a name derived from Gaelic which means \"majestic dwelling\" - in June 1991, in a ceremony led by actor Sir Sean Connery. Since then it has hosted many celebrities, including JK Rowling, who finished the last book in her Harry Potter series in one of the hotel's suites.",
    "Florida faces 'matter of life and death' as Hurricane Milton closes in\n\nFlorida residents are rushing to finish emergency preparations - or just leave - as Hurricane Milton races toward landfall on the heavily-populated Tampa Bay. Milton is currently a category five storm, packing ferocious winds of up to 165mph (270km/h). It is expected to hit with full force on Wednesday night, less than two weeks after the state was struck by the devastating Hurricane Helene. President Joe Biden warned people in Florida on Tuesday to leave their homes as a \"matter of life and death\" while the state undertakes its largest evacuation effort in years. \"A category five, that is like a giant tornado coming at you,\" one resident of the Gulf Coast city of Bradenton told the BBC from the hotel that he has evacuated to in Kissimmee.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be there,\" said Gerald Lemus. \"This will be a life-changing storm no matter where it hits.\" Mr Lemus, who has lived in Bradenton his entire life, said he has never evacuated for any previous storm. But he decided he has to for the safety of his eight-year-old daughter. \"I just looked at her and I couldn't traumatise her to something like this,\" he said on Tuesday night. \"It's a gamble we weren't willing to make.\" ML Ferguson has been struggling to rebuild her home in Anna Maria, Florida, after it was severely damaged last month by Helene, a powerful category four hurricane when it hit. \"This one is going to be way worse than Helene,\" she said on the phone while stalled in highway traffic out of the city. \"My car is totalled, we all were laid off of our job, and [my] belongings were ruined. After this storm hits, I will officially become homeless.\" Governor Ron DeSantis said on Tuesday that Florida had prepared dozens of shelters outside of evacuation zones to help house residents left stranded in the wake of the \"monster\" storm. Long queues at petrol stations formed in south Florida, as some stations began running out of fuel. Chynna Perkins told the BBC she is remaining in Tampa, where she lives in a newly constructed home outside the mandatory evacuation zones. \"I don't think people really understand how much planning has to go into a decision like this,\" she said, adding that she has two large Great Danes. \"There's so much traffic and barely any gas available right now. People are running out of gas on the highway.\" DeSantis said that petrol was being trucked to stations, and electric vehicle charging stations also were deployed along roadways to ease the evacuation. Tampa resident Steve Crist, spoke to the BBC while boarding up the windows of his dentist office. \"Everyone\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve never seen it so quiet,\" he said. Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, President Biden said the storm could be one of Florida's worst in a century. \"Evacuate now, now, now,\" he told Florida residents. The White House cancelled Biden's planned visit to Germany and Angola in order to oversee preparations for Milton and ongoing recovery from Hurricane Helene.\n\nLess than two weeks ago Hurricane Helene - the deadliest mainland storm since Katrina in 2005 - pummelled the US south-east, killing at least 225. Hundreds more are missing. At least 14 of those deaths were in Florida, where 51 of 67 counties are now under emergency warnings as Milton approaches. The National Hurricane Center has warned people to brace for strong winds that could potentially send debris still on the streets from Helene to destructively fly through the air. Rainfall totals could reach highs of 15in (38cm), and coastal areas could see storm surges of 10-15ft (3-4.5m). Hurricanes are categorised based on wind speed. Category three and higher are considered major because of their potential for damage and loss of life, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Parts of Pinellas County, where at least a dozen people were killed by Helene, were placed under evacuation orders on Monday.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Huge tailbacks as people try to flee Hurricane Milton\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) expects Milton to make landfall as an \"extremely dangerous hurricane\" in the US state of Florida on Wednesday night, local time. It could strike near the city of Tampa, whose wider metropolitan area has a population of more than three million people. Forecasters are warning of torrential rain, flash flooding, high winds and possible storm surges - which occur when water moves inland from the coast. It comes as the US government warns that clean-up efforts could take years after Hurricane Helene. Over 12,000 cubic yards of debris have been removed in Helene-affected areas of Florida in less than two days, officials said. Hundreds of roads remain closed, hampering efforts to send aid to hard-hit communities. As well as in Florida, deaths were recorded in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia - and the worst-hit state, North Carolina.

    "Dylan Thomas has pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder\n\nA man who killed his housemate on Christmas Eve had been arrested weeks earlier for attempting to scale the fence at Buckingham Palace, a court heard. Dylan Thomas, 24, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of William Bush, 23, in December 2023, but denies murder. Cardiff Crown Court heard that the pair had met at school at Christ College in Brecon, Powys, and had been friends since. Mr Bush was popular but \"Dylan Thomas had few friends and was viewed as something of a loner,\u201d said Gregory Bull KC, prosecuting, adding his \"only real friend was the deceased\".\n\nThe jury was shown a police interview with Mr Bush's brother, Alex, from the 12 January 2024. In the interview, he told detectives he had spoken to his brother via Facetime who told him Mr Thomas had been arrested on 6 November for trying to climb over the palace's fence. Mr Bush said \"Will laughed it off\" and told him \"it was Dylan\u2019s nature\". He said his brother was popular, always had lots of friends, adding that he was \"too caring at times\". The court heard that William Bush and Mr Thomas lived together on Chapel Street, Llandaff. The \"dynamics\" of their close friendship began to change when Mr Bush got a girlfriend and was planning to move in with her, the court heard. The jury was also shown a recorded police interview with William Bush\u2019s girlfriend, Ella Jefferies. She talks about Mr Thomas being on bail following his London arrest. Ms Jefferies also describes her boyfriend barricading himself in his bedroom and feeling scared after a discussion with his housemate. The court was told Mr Thomas said: \"I thought and wondered about killing you. I just wanted to see what would happen if I do certain things.\" Ms Jefferies said there were a number of weapons at the house - a samurai sword bought by the defendant in Austria and a \u201ccouple of BB guns\".\n\nOn 23 December, Mr Thomas went to stay with his grandmother in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan. Mr Bush had planned to spend that evening with Ms Jefferies and then Christmas with his family in Brecon. At his grandmother\u2019s house, Mr Thomas seemed unsettled, the court was told. Mr Bull said at 00:36 on 24 December, he carried out a search on his computer for the \u201canatomy of the neck\" and at 02:42 sent Mr Bush a text message saying he needed to see him before he went to Brecon for Christmas. Mr Bull said that indicated that Mr Thomas was formulating an intention to kill his housemate.\n\nWilliam Bush's family described him as a \"loyal, funny and caring son, brother and boyfriend\"\n\nAt 03:31, Mr Thomas tried to book an Uber taxi to Chapel Street, but was unable to. The following morning his grandmother, Sharon Burton, agreed to drive Mr Thomas to Llandaff, because he said he wanted to walk the dog. On the journey, Mrs Burton described him becoming \"more and more agitated\" and sending several text messages. She parked outside the property while Mr Thomas went in. The prosecution say he then armed himself with two knives, one large kitchen knife, and another flick knife, and went up two flights of stairs to Mr Bush\u2019s bedroom, where an attack began. Mr Bush sustained a total of 37 stab wounds, which included 13 to the front and side of his neck, eight to the back of his neck, seven to the front of his trunk and eight to the back of his trunk.\n\nHe also suffered a slash to his face, a cut to his ear and 13 cuts to his left hand. Mrs Burton, who has hearing loss, then saw Mr Thomas banging on her car window distressed. \"Passers-by heard screams of horror coming from the address,\" said Mr Bull. Mrs Burton then found a wounded Mr Bush on the patio outside the property and began to give him CPR. The jury listened to a 999 call made by Mr Thomas in which he asked for an ambulance to come to the car park on Chapel Street. He told the operator his friend had \"gone mental\" and stabbed him. He was asked by the 999 operator to describe the injuries and where they were. \"Everywhere on him, I kept going and stabbed him. I didn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said, adding: \"he stabbed me on my hands, my hands to get the knife.\" \"This was a planned attack,\" said Mr Bull, adding: \"He deliberately armed himself with knives and attacked him from behind.\" Mr Bull told the jury that Mr Thomas is being treated for schizophrenia at Ashworth High Secure Hospital on Merseyside, from where he\u2019s appearing via videolink.",

Zoe Ball: 'It's time to step away from the early alarm call'\n\nZoe Ball has announced she is stepping down as presenter of Radio 2's Breakfast Show in December. Ball said: \u201cAfter six incredible years on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, it\u2019s time for me to step away from the very early mornings and focus on family.\" She will remain on the station, and said more news on what that would involve would be announced in the new year. Ball later announced that Scott Mills will be her replacement, moving from his afternoon show slot on the station. Ball's last show will be on Friday 20 December, \"just in time for Christmas with plenty of fun and shenanigans,\" she told listeners on her Tuesday show.\n\nScott Mills: \"I am beyond excited to be handed the baton\"\n\nTelling her listeners about her decision, she said: \"I've decided it's time to step away from the early alarm call and start a new chapter. \"We\u2019ve shared a hell of a lot, the good times, the tough times, there\u2019s been a lot of laughter. And I am going to miss you cats.\" She added she would also miss her colleagues, saying they were \"like family to me\". The early morning presenter added: \"But I won\u2019t miss the 4am alarm call, if I'm completely honest. \"You know I love you all to bits.\" Mills said: \u201cZoe and I have been such good friends now for over 25 years and have spent much of that time as part of the same radio family here at Radio 2 and also on Radio 1. \"She's done an incredible job on this show over the past six years, and I am beyond excited to be handed the baton.\u201d Speaking on his afternoon show later on Tuesday, Mills told his listeners: \"I can\u2019t thank you enough for how lovely you all were when I took over from Steve (Wright), and I know that you\u2019re going to extend that love to Trevor Nelson. \"Honestly, I can't wait to start with you every morning.\"\n\nBall said she will miss her listeners and colleagues but not getting up early\n\nBall heaped praise on her successor: \u201cScott and I go way back to our Radio 1 days, when he was doing early mornings before me. He\u2019s been a close friend for years, and I\u2019m beyond thrilled it\u2019s him taking over the Breakfast Show. \"Breakfast has always been his dream. He\u2019s not only a blooming brilliant producer but one of the best in radio. I can\u2019t wait to tune in on the school run!\u201d Mills recently stood in for Ball when she took a few weeks off from her show. Trevor Nelson, who currently presents in the evenings Monday to Thursday, will replace Mills as the presenter of the 2pm to 4pm weekday afternoon show from January. Nelson said: \"I'm looking to have lots of fun and will be bringing a bit of soul to the new show.\" Meanwhile, DJ Spoony will extend his weekly edition of The Good Grove (Friday nights - 9-11pm) to four weekly shows on Monday \u2013 Thursday nights and Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s Kitchen Disco will be extended from one to two hours, kicking off on Friday nights at 9pm.\n\nBall hosted the BBC One Saturday morning children's show Live and Kicking in 1997\n\nBall first joined BBC Radio in October 1997 as the co-host of the Radio 1 Breakfast Show with co-presenter Kevin Greening. From October 1998 to March 2000, Zoe hosted the programme solo, the first woman to do so. Helen Thomas, head of Radio 2, said: \"Zoe has woken up the nation on Radio 2 with incredible warmth, wit and so much joy since January 2019. \"I\u2019d like to thank her for approaching each show with as much vim and vigour as if it were her first. I\u2019m thrilled that that she'll remain an important part of the Radio 2 family.\" She was the BBC's highest-paid on-air female presenter in 2023/24. Her salary of between \u00a3950,000 and \u00a3954,999 ranked her second on the list of top-earning talent behind Gary Lineker, according to the corporation's annual report published in July. Many more stars don't make the list, with several of them almost certainly earning more than Ball and Lineker but they are not named because the BBC does not have to disclose the salaries of stars who are paid through production companies. The latest figures from radio industry body Rajar state that Ball's programme is the most listened to breakfast show in the UK. But it dipped by 146,000 listeners to 6.28 million in the most recent quarter, according to industry figures from Rajar. BBC Radio 2 is the UK\u2019s most listened to radio station, with a weekly audience of 13.3 million, the figures show. At the 2024 Audio and Radio Industry Awards, also known as the Arias, Scott Mills won gold for the best music entertainment show, while Ball won bronze for the best music breakfast show.",

    "Holly Bowles, left, was confirmed to have died on Friday, a day after British lawyer Simone White and Australian Bianca Jones\n\nA second Australian teenager has died of suspected methanol poisoning, bringing to six the number of foreign tourists who have died after apparently drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. The family of Holly Bowles, 19, said it was with \"broken hearts\" that they confirmed her death, more than a week after she fell ill in the tourist town of Vang Vieng. Her friend Bianca Jones, also 19, and British lawyer Simone White, 28, from south-east London, were confirmed to have died on Thursday. An unnamed US man and two Danish women, aged 19 and 20, are also among the victims of the suspected poisoning, believed to be connected to bootleg alcohol.\n\nIn a statement released to media on Friday, Holly's family said they were taking comfort from the fact she had brought so much \"joy and happiness to so many people\". They added that she had been living \"her best life travelling through South East Asia meeting new friends and enjoying incredible experiences\" when she became ill. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said: \u201cAll Australians will be heartbroken by the tragic passing of Holly Bowles. I offer my deepest sympathies to her family and friends.\" Holly and Bianca were taken to hospital on Wednesday, 13 November, after they failed to check out of their hostel in the small, riverside town of Vang Vieng, about two hours north of the capital Vientiane.\n\nNews reports and testimonies suggest the tourists may have consumed alcohol laced with methanol - a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol. Medical specialists say drinking as little as 25 millilitres of methanol can be fatal, but it is sometimes added to drinks because it is cheaper than alcohol. Christer Hogstrand, a professor of molecular ecotoxicology, at King\u2019s College London points out, it is also \u201cnot uncommon in home-distilled alcohol\". \u201cMethanol is like the alcohol in our drinks \u2013 colourless and odourless \u2013 but its impact on humans can be deadly,\" he explained. \"It has a different carbon atom structure which completely changes how humans process it in the body, leading to these potentially fatal consequences.\u201d The UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) updated its travel advice, external to reflect the dangers of methanol poisoning in Laos on Wednesday. It advises tourists to only buy alcoholic beverages from licensed shops and to seek urgent medical advice if they suspect they've been poisoned.\n\nIt is not yet known where any of the people who fell sick or died were poisoned. It can take up to 24 hours for victims to start showing signs of illness. The Nana Backpacker Hostel - where the Australian teenagers were staying - has said it gave out free shots to around 100 guests the previous evening. But the hostel's manager told news agency Associated Press that no other guests had become unwell., external The manager of the hostel is among a number of people who have since been detained for questioning by police. Online booking agency Hostelworld said in a statement that it has removed Nana Backpacker Hostel from its platform, and has contacted all customers in Vang Vieng and surrounding areas. It added it was advising all travellers in the area to \"exercise caution\" when consuming alcohol and to \"only purchase products from reputable vendors\". Few details have emerged about any of the other victims and where they may have visited.\n\nSimone White, a lawyer who lived in Orpington, was reportedly travelling with a group of friends. In a statement, her parents said they were \"devastated by the loss of our beautiful, kind and loving daughter\". \"Simone was one of a kind and had the most wonderful energy and spark for life. She was a soul who gave so much to so many and was loved by her family, friends and colleagues.\" They added she had been \"taken from us too soon\" and would be \"sorely missed by her brother, grandmother and entire family\". \"Our hearts go out to all other families who have been affected by this terrible tragedy,\" the statement said. Her law firm, Squire Patton Boggs, described Ms White as \"a talented colleague with a bright future ahead of her\". \"Our thoughts go out to all of Simone\u2019s family, friends, and those colleagues and clients who had the privilege to work with and know Simone.\" Australia is pushing authorities to be open about their investigation into the incident. New Zealand and Dutch officials have also both said they were monitoring incidents involving nationals. The New Zealand government has told the BBC that one of its citizens was suspected to have suffered methanol poisoning in Laos. Vang Vieng is a hub for backpackers travelling across south-east Asia. It's home to the Banana Pancake Trail - a popular backpacking route spanning Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nBackpacker Natasha Moore said her parents had asked her to go home after the deaths\n\nNatasha Moore, a 22-year-old solo backpacker from Manchester, told the BBC she cancelled her booking for the Nana Backpacker Hostel after hearing about the deaths. Ms Moore said that among backpackers she had met in the country, \u201cthe general consensus is we\u2019re all just really scared\". Ms Moore said she has received free drinks, including shots, throughout her travels in south-east Asia, but would now only drink those sealed on purchase. \u201cFinding out that people pass away from just trying to enjoy themselves is just heartbreaking and it could have been any one of us,\u201d she added.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?",
    "'We are dying every moment' - the Afghans risking their lives to reach UK\n\nAzaan has tried to leave Afghanistan three times since the Taliban seized power\n\nThe first time Azaan made the jump across the wall, he broke his arm. Braving the 20ft (6m) drop into a wide trench below is, for many Afghans, the only way to cross into Turkey from Iran - and yet hundreds risk it each day. \u201cI was in severe pain,\u201d the former Afghan army officer told the BBC. \u201cSeveral others had broken limbs. The smuggler left us here and told us to run in the direction of the lights of Van city. Many of us were fading out of hunger. I fainted.\u201d The wall - which stretches for nearly 300km (185 miles) - was built to prevent illegal crossings, and is patrolled constantly by Turkish border forces. Jumping off it is among the first of a series of extraordinary risks Afghan migrants take as they cross continents, countries and seas to reach the UK and other countries in Europe. Over the past year, fleeing their country has become more perilous than ever before for Afghans, because Pakistan, Iran and Turkey have intensified their crackdown on illegal migration from Afghanistan along their borders, and have also carried out mass deportations. Azaan couldn\u2019t continue. He was in pain, and had barely eaten in days. The migrants were given just one boiled egg every morning and a cup of rice in the evening by smugglers who\u2019d charged them nearly $4,000 (\u00a33,150) for the journey to Europe. \u201cI had two friends \u2013 we had made a promise to not leave each other,\u201d he says. His friends tied scarves around him, hoisted him up the wall, back into Iran. Iranian police deported him to Afghanistan. It was Azaan\u2019s second failed attempt. The first time he returned from the Afghanistan-Iran border because he\u2019d taken his wife and young children along, and he realised they wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the journey. Azaan didn\u2019t give up. Roughly a year later, once his arm had healed, he made a third attempt. \u201cI had sold my house earlier. This time I sold my wife\u2019s jewellery,\u201d he says.\n\nAfghans wait to attempt to cross into Turkey, in a still from a video sent to the BBC by a people smuggler\n\nIn exchange for the money, migrants like Azaan are promised a route to Europe, handed over from one people smuggler to another along the way. Back at the wall, the smuggler placed a ladder on the Iranian side, and cut the razor wire at the top to create a path for migrants. \u201cThere were 60 to 70 of us,\" Azaan recalls. \"We climbed to the top and then the smuggler told us to jump.\u201d For the law and politics graduate, who served his country and led a dignified, comfortable life until August 2021 when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, it is a humiliating situation to be in. In its three years in power, the Taliban government has imposed increasing, brutal restrictions on women. According to the UN, a third of the country\u2019s people don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from. And those who worked for the former military fear reprisal. \u201cThe people I fought against for 20 years are now in power,\" he explains. \"Our lives are in danger. My daughter won\u2019t be able to study once she turns 13. And I have no work. I\u2019ll continue to try to leave even if it costs me my life. \"Here we are dying every moment. It\u2019s better to die once, for good.\"\n\nIn this still from a video sent to the BBC by the people smuggler, wire at the top of the wall is cut through\n\nAzaan is now back in Kabul with his family. The third attempt to flee ended with a beating and deportation. \u201cThey beat me with the butt of a gun. One boy was hit on his genitals. He was in a terrible state. An old man\u2019s leg was broken. There was a corpse in the trenches in Turkey. This is what I saw. But Iran is also treating us badly. I know Afghans have been severely beaten in Iran too,\u201d he says. After weeks of digging through people smuggling networks, the BBC established contact with an Afghan smuggler in Iran, aiming to get an insight into the increased dangers Afghans are facing. \u201cIranian police are shooting a lot at the border with Afghanistan. One of my friends was killed recently,\u201d the smuggler says, speaking to us over the phone from Iran. In October, Iran was accused of firing indiscriminately at Afghans crossing over into Iran\u2019s Sistan province from Balochistan in Pakistan. The UN has raised concerns and called for an investigation. The BBC has seen and verified videos of the dead and injured. Sistan-Balochistan is one of the major routes taken by Afghan migrants to enter Iran, but given the increased risks as well as Pakistan\u2019s mass deportation of Afghans, many are now opting for other routes, in particular, Islam Qala in Afghanistan\u2019s Herat province. Once in Iran, migrants move to Tehran before going towards the Macu or Khoy counties, to attempt the crossing into Turkey, handed over from one smuggler to another.\n\nThe Afghan smuggler says he hides migrants near the border wall, and then they wait until there\u2019s less patrolling of a portion of the border wall to take a shot at the \u201cgame\u201d. He carries a ladder, and a wire cutter to cut the razor wire at the top of the wall and make a path for migrants. He says crossings have become extremely challenging in recent months. \u201cThe Turkish police catch 100 to 150 migrants every night. They have no mercy on them. They break their arms and legs,\u201d he says. The BBC has put the allegations to the governments of Turkey and Iran but has not yet received a response. We asked the smuggler how he can justify his illegal business which endangers the lives of Afghans, while charging them thousands of dollars. \u201cWe don\u2019t force people to take these risks. We tell them that whether they get to their destination is 99% in God\u2019s hands, and they could get killed or imprisoned. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m guilty. What are we supposed to do when people tell us their family is going hungry in Afghanistan?\u201d the smuggler says. Those who make it past Turkish security forces move from Van towards Kayseri city and then to the Izmir, Canakkale or Bodrum coasts - the next point of peril on the migrant trail.\n\nIn Kabul, an elderly father took us to the grave of his son. In his twenties, Javid was a former soldier. Fearing for his life in Taliban controlled Afghanistan, he fled the country in an attempt to make it to the UK. In March this year, he was among 22 people killed after the rubber dinghy they were in sank in the Aegean sea near Canakkale in Turkey, as they attempted to get to Greece. His pregnant wife was also among the 46 people squeezed on to the boat. They both managed to swim to the shore, but he died of hypothermia. \u201cFrom Istanbul, smugglers took us to Esenyurt. From there we were packed into cars like animals. We were dropped off in a forested area. We walked through it for four hours and then we reached the coast from where we were put on the boat,\u201d Javid\u2019s wife says, speaking to us over the phone from Turkey where she\u2019s still living.\n\nJavid's father feels betrayed and abandoned by the countries which fought in Afghanistan\n\nIn Kabul, Javid\u2019s father broke down inconsolably as he showed us photos of the young man with short black hair wearing track pants and a sweatshirt, posing on a park bench. \u201cEven now when I remember him the grief is such that it\u2019s only with God's blessing that I survive the torment,\u201d he says. He believes that foreign countries which fought in Afghanistan bear responsibility for what is happening to Afghans like his son. \u201cWe fought alongside them in the war against terrorism. If we had known we would be betrayed and abandoned, no one would have agreed to join hands with foreign forces.\u201d According to the UN, Afghans are among the top asylum seekers in the world, and in the UK they are the second largest group arriving in the country in small boats, another journey fraught with peril. The UK has two resettlement schemes for Afghans. One is for Afghans who worked directly for the British military and British government, and under the second scheme \u2013 the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) - those who assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan, stood up for values of democracy, women\u2019s freedoms and people at risk can be eligible for relocation. But after the first phase of evacuation in 2021-22, progress has been extremely slow.\n\nShahida made it to the UK and has applied for asylum\n\nThis means women like Shahida, who worked in the former parliament of Afghanistan and participated in street protests against the Taliban after they seized power, could not find timely legal routes out of the country. Shahida feared the threat of detention and torture by the Taliban government in Afghanistan every day. She arrived in the UK in a small boat in May this year, having begun the journey out of Afghanistan more than two years ago. Now in Liverpool, she has applied for asylum. \u201cI come from a well-known and well-respected family. I\u2019ve never done anything illegal in my life. When authorities would apprehend us during the journey, I would look down out of shame,\u201d she says. Shahida describes how she crossed the English Channel on an inflatable dinghy, packed in with 64 people. This year has been the deadliest year for migrant crossings across the Channel. More than 50 people have died. \u201cThere was water up to my waist. And because our guide lost the way we floated for hours. I thought this was going to be the end of my life. I\u2019m diabetic so I had to urinate sitting there. And because I was thirsty I had to drink the water I had urinated in. Can you imagine? In Kabul I had everything. My whole life has been taken away from me because the Taliban took over,\u201d she says. Back in Kabul, Azaan, the former military officer, now wants to sell a small patch of land, the only asset he has left, to gather money to make another attempt. \u201cThis is the only purpose of my life now, to get myself to a safer place.\u201d All names have been changed.",
    "Israeli construction along buffer zone with Syria violates ceasefire, UN says\n\nThe BBC saw construction work on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line in the occupied Golan Heights\n\nThe United Nations says Israeli construction along a demilitarised buffer zone with Syria has led to \u201csevere violations\u201d of a 50-year-old ceasefire agreement, which risk increasing tensions along their shared frontier in the occupied Golan Heights. Satellite photographs show new trenches and earth berms dug over the past few months along the length of what is known as the Area of Separation (AoS). The BBC has filmed construction taking place alongside a military vehicle near the town of Majdal Shams, and fresh earthworks in rural land further south. The work in both locations is believed to lie within Israeli-controlled areas. The UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) says most of the Israeli construction does not breach the AoS, but that some trenches - dug under protection from military vehicles including tanks - do cross into it, and that Israeli army vehicles and personnel have also entered the buffer zone.\n\nBernard Lee of UNDOF told the BBC's Lucy Williamson that two major lines of trenches had been dug\n\nBeneath the watchtower at UNDOF\u2019s Camp Ziouani base, the Israeli fence snakes towards a line of volcanic mountains; a Syrian flag flutters in the trees beyond the post, marking the other side of the separation zone. Chief of Mission Bernard Lee told the BBC that two major lines of trenches had been dug, along with three more limited ones, each some 6m (20 ft) wide. He estimated that trenches crossed into the AoS in a handful locations, by a couple of metres in each case, but said he had not visited the sites himself. UNDOF was not able to immediately share visual evidence of the reported incursions, and permission for the BBC to view or film the locations from a nearby observation post has so far not been granted. Initial searches of satellite photographs have not produced images in enough detail to independently confirm the UN allegations.\n\nThe AoS was set up as part of Israel\u2019s ceasefire agreement with Syria in 1974, following Israel\u2019s earlier occupation of the Golan Heights. Israeli forces are required to be west of the so-called Alpha Line, while Syrian forces must be east of the Bravo Line, which runs along the other side of the AoS. Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so unilaterally in 2019. Israeli settlers there live alongside about 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze, who stayed on in the Golan after it was captured. Despite the presence of Iran-backed militia groups in Syria, this frontier has remained relatively calm, as Israeli ground forces have battled Iranian allies in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 13 months. But UNDOF said in a statement that the Syrian authorities had \u201cstrongly protested\u201d the ongoing Israeli work. And that the UN itself had \u201crepeatedly\u201d taken its concerns over the Israeli violations to Israel\u2019s military authorities. Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told the BBC that the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria - and did not break the ceasefire agreement. \u201cIsraeli officials have been communicating with the UN about these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can tell you that the IDF is operating on Israeli territory making sure that a terror invasion is not possible, making sure we are defending our borders.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military said the trenches were designed to protect against infiltration by Iran-backed groups in Syria\n\nThe threat of a surprise invasion by Israel\u2019s neighbours has loomed larger here since the 7 October Hamas attacks. \u201cWill [the trenches] stop what happened on 7 October? Yes,\u201d said Bernard Lee. \u201cCould you get a pick-up truck over it? No.\u201d But the defences being built along this frontier don\u2019t address the more immediate threat from drones and missiles regularly launched by Iranian militia groups in Syria and Iraq \u2013 and frequently shot down by Israeli forces. Nor do they address Israel\u2019s concerns about Syria being an \u201coxygen line\u201d for Iran to smuggle weapons to its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. Mr Lee said commercial smugglers already used the AoS to smuggle cigarettes and electronics between Syria and Lebanon. And that a new patrol road, built by the UN, is assisting them. \u201cThey come over the mountain, enter the area of separation with a trail of pack horses, eight at a time, with two armed guys,\u201d he said. \u201cThey unload the pack horses and a pick-up truck meets them at our road: we\u2019ve motorized the smuggling business.\u201d Asked whether the same route could be used to take weapons from Syria into Lebanon, he replied: \u201cThat is what the IDF are concerned about.\u201d\n\nIsrael has also pointed to what it says are \u201cdaily\u201d violations along the demilitarized frontier by Syria. In May, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN wrote to the secretary-general to complain about Syrian violations, including \u201carmed presence in the area of separation\u201d which \u201conly heighten tensions in our already volatile region\u201d.

    "There were riots across England in the summer, including in Sunderland\n\nThere was a \"clear connection\" between the violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland in the summer and posts on social media and messaging apps, Ofcom has concluded. The government had asked the media regulator to consider how illegal content and disinformation spread during the unrest. In an open letter setting out its findings, external, Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said such content spread \"widely and quickly\" online following the stabbings in Southport, in July, which preceded the disorder. She added most online services took \"rapid action\", but said the responses of some firms were \"uneven\". \"Posts about the Southport incident and subsequent events from high-profile accounts reached millions of users, demonstrating the role that virality and algorithmic recommendations can play in driving divisive narratives in a crisis period,\" Dame Melanie wrote. The BBC approached major tech platforms for their response to the letter. X, formerly Twitter, told BBC News some accounts were suspended and other content was removed from the platform following the riots. A spokesman from the messaging app Telegram said they \"immediately removed UK channels that called for violence as they were discovered in August\". None of the other major tech platforms responded to the BBC's request for comment. Experts say the unrest showed the power - and responsibility - social media platforms have. \"Ofcom is saying that social media posts inciting riots are not just words - they play a big part in fanning the flames of disorder,\" said Rashik Parmar, from BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT. \"There should be accountability where platforms allow dangerously divisive content to go unchecked,\" he added. Media analyst Hanna Kahlert, at Midia Research, said Ofcom's findings amounted to a \"call for social platforms to take greater ownership of the impact of content\".\n\nAt the time of the unrest, Ofcom faced criticism for not doing more to rein in the spread of untrue and inflammatory content. It urged tech firms to take action - but also pointed out the enhanced powers it is due to get under the Online Safety Act had not yet come into force. The act will see the creation of codes of practice for big tech firms which will place new responsibilities on them for tackling disinformation. \"I am confident that, had the draft codes been in force at the time, they would have provided a firm basis for urgent engagement with services on the steps they were taking to protect UK users from harm,\" Dame Melanie wrote. She said the new powers set \"clear standards\" for what Ofcom would expect to see in future from big tech firms, such as:\n\u2022 None Specifying in their terms of service provisions how individuals are to be protected from priority illegal content\n\u2022 None Having systems designed to swiftly take down illegal content and having \"adequately resourced\" content moderation teams\n\u2022 None Providing effective and accessible mechanisms for users to complain about illegal content, including on messaging platforms\n\nThe unrest which broke out in August this year was the worst that had been seen in the UK for a decade. It was followed by waves of arrests and prosecutions, some for online offences. The role that big tech played was subject to much scrutiny - though the platforms themselves remained largely silent at the time. The prime minister also got dragged into a war of words with one of the highest profile people in tech - X owner Elon Musk. The tech billionaire suggested that \"civil war is inevitable\" following the disorder. Sir Keir Starmer hit back saying there was \"no justification\" for Mr Musk's comments, adding there was more that social media companies \"can and should be doing\". A spokesman from X told the BBC: \"X monitored the platform and actioned thousands of pieces of content as part of our internal incident response protocols.\" The X spokesman said some accounts were suspended and other content was removed, but they didn\u2019t specify any more details. The spokesman also highlighted the role of community notes. He said this \"played an important role in addressing misleading content across the platform in relation to the incidents and these have been viewed millions of times\".",
    "'God's influencer' to be made first millennial saint in April\n\nCardinals and bishops attend the beatification ceremony of Carlo Acutis in 2020\n\nA London-born teenager nicknamed \"God's influencer\" for his online skills will be made a saint in April. Carlo Acutis, who died of leukaemia in 2006 at the age of 15, will be the first millennial - a person born in the early 1980s to late 1990s - to be canonised by the Catholic church. Pope Francis previously cleared the way for him to be made a saint by attributing a second miracle to him in May. The teenager has also been labelled \"the patron saint of the internet\" for his work recording miracles online and running websites for Catholic organisations.\n\nHe was previously beatified - attributed his first miracle - in 2020, the healing of a Brazilian child diagnosed with a congenital disease. Though Carlo Acutis was born in the UK, he died in Monza, in Italy, having spent much of his childhood there. His body was moved to the town of Assisi a year after his death, and it currently resides on display alongside other relics linked to him. Mr Acutis gained his nickname partly by designing websites for his parish and school, but he mainly became known for launching a website seeking to document every reported Eucharistic miracle. The website was launched online days before his death and has since been translated into several different languages, and used as the basis for an exhibition which has travelled around the world. Miracles are typically investigated and assessed over a period of several months, with a person being eligible for sainthood after they have two to their name. For something to be deemed a miracle it typically requires an act seen to be beyond what is possible in nature - such as through the sudden healing of a person deemed to be near-death. The second miracle attributed to Mr Acutis came in 2024, when a university student in Florence was healed despite having bleeding on the brain after suffering head trauma. Pope Francis told an audience at the Vatican that the teenager would be made a saint during the weekend beginning 26 April.",
    "Bradley Nelson was left with disabilities, after being shaken by his dad as a baby\n\nA boy left blind and brain-damaged after being attacked as a baby by his father has died in hospital, prompting a fresh police investigation. Bradley Nelson, nine, was left severely disabled and unable to walk after being assaulted by Darren Spreadbury in April 2016, when he was seven months old. Despite being born \"fit and well\" Bradley was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Nearly nine years later, Bradley, from Whitby, died at Scarborough General Hospital last month after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn May 2018, Spreadbury was sentenced to four years in prison, after scans found Bradley\u2019s brain injuries had been caused by shaken baby syndrome. \"Bradley was blind because he shook him that hard, he snapped his optic nerve and he had a can of Coke\u2019s worth of blood between his brain and his skull,\" Bradley's mum, Sharon Boocock, said. Doctors later determined he had suffered a brain injury that was \"unexplained and non-accidental\", leading to the arrest of Spreadbury. He pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was handed a 10-year restraining order, as well as being sent to prison.\n\nBradley underwent several operations in the years following the attack\n\nIn the years following the attack, Bradley needed \"24-hour care\" and was unable to walk, talk or feed himself, according to his mum. He underwent several operations and suffered complications and infections. Ms Boocock said her life at the time was devoted to staying in to look after Bradley. \"I couldn\u2019t go anywhere after 17:00 because Bradley would come home from school and that was me housebound,\" she said. She explained how she had juggled her job as a bartender to earn \"whatever money she could\" and said she was \"learning to live again\". Last month, Bradley was sent home from school after complaining about feeling sleepy. He was taken in to hospital and Ms Boocock and her partner, Jonny Nelson, were told he had suffered a seizure after falling unconscious. Bradley died on 22 October after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nBradley was described by his mum as \"always smiling and happy\"\n\nSharon said, despite everything, Bradley had been \"always smiling and happy\". Last week, police informed her they were investigating the cause of his death. A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: \"We have been made aware of the death of a nine-year-old boy from the Whitby area, who sadly passed away in hospital on October 22. \"The child had complex medical needs and an investigation into the cause of his death is currently under way, reflecting due process in such circumstances.\" A fundraiser has been launched on GoFundMe by Sharon\u2019s friends to help cover Bradley\u2019s funeral costs.

    "Robert Jenrick has accepted the job of shadow justice secretary in Kemi Badenoch's senior team, the BBC understands. The new Tory leader is also expected to name Dame Priti Patel as her shadow foreign secretary and Mel Stride as her shadow chancellor. Dame Priti, Stride and Jenrick were all candidates against Badenoch in the Tory leadership race, with Badenoch beating Jenrick in the final round. By appointing not only former rivals but also figures from different wings of the party, Badenoch will be hoping to unite the Conservatives after a bruising election defeat.\n\nHowever, there was wrangling over which, if any, job Jenrick would take and during negotiations one Conservative source, not close to the leadership, told the BBC: \"Kemi just doesn\u2019t like Rob. She thinks his whole schtick about her and whether she has any policies has done her lasting damage with the right and with Reform voters. \"This is only likely to further unravel.\"\n\nThe pair clashed during the final weeks of the leadership campaign, with Jenrick accusing Badenoch of being \"disrespectful\" to Tory members by failing to set out policies. Badenoch said she would not have used that word and, defending her own approach, said she would not make a promise \"unless I know how I am going to deliver it\". However, following the conclusion of the contest the two candidates exchanged warm words. In her victory speech on Saturday, Badenoch praised Jenrick\u2019s \"energy and determination\", adding: \"You and I know that we don't actually disagree on very much, and I have no doubt that you have a key role to play in our party for many years to come.\" Jenrick in turn congratulated his opponent on her win and urged Conservatives to unite behind the new leader. On Monday, a friend of Jenrick's said: \"Rob thinks the party needs to come together and take the fight to Labour. \"Unity could not be more important. He\u2019s eager to expose Labour\u2019s dreadful record on law and order.\" A formal announcement of Badenoch's full shadow cabinet is expected before its first meeting on Tuesday. Former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott has been given the job of shadow education secretary, with Neil O'Brien appointed shadow education minister. Trott and O'Brien have already appeared in their new roles in the House of Commons at Education Questions. Nigel Huddleston and Lord Dominic Johnson have also been appointed as joint chairmen of the Conservative party, the BBC understands. It follows the appointment of Castle Point MP Dame Rebecca Harris as Tory chief whip on Sunday evening.\n\nThe new shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti, has represented the Essex constituency of Witham since 2010 and served in several government departments during the Conservatives\u2019 time in power. She was forced to resign as international development secretary in 2017 following unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials but was brought back into government by Boris Johnson, who gave her the senior role of home secretary. At the Home Office she started the Rwanda policy, which aimed to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats by deporting them to the East African country but was later scrapped by the new Labour government. A prominent Brexit supporter, she is seen as being on the right of the party. By contrast Stride comes more from the left. Like Dame Priti he joined Parliament in 2010, winning the constituency of Central Devon, and has served in several government departments. A close ally of Rishi Sunak, he was given the job of work and pensions secretary and during the general election was trusted to do frequent media appearances. On Sunday Badenoch told the BBC she thought taxes had been too high under Sunak but has now given one of his most prominent supporters the much sought-after role of shadow chancellor.\n\nLaura Trott served as chief secretary to the Treasury in the Sunak government\n\nNew shadow education secretary Laura Trott has been MP for Sevenoaks in Kent since 2019, and served as number two in the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt when he was chancellor. Neil O'Brien has been MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston since 2017 and was most recently a health minister. He resigned from Sunak's government in November 2023 and took a more critical stance on the then-prime minister from the backbenches. While Trott and Huddleston supported Badenoch in the leadership, O'Brien had supported her rival Jenrick. The current Labour government has 120 ministers, meaning the Tories may struggle to shadow all posts given they only have 121 MPs. Former Home Secretary and defeated leadership candidate James Cleverly last week ruled out serving in the shadow cabinet, telling the FT, external he had been \"liberated\" from 16 years on the political front line and was now \"not particularly in the mood to be boxed back into a narrow band again\". Former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, former Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, former Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell and former Environment Secretary Steve Barclay have also said they will return to the backbenches and not serve in the new shadow cabinet.",

    "What RFK Jr could do on US vaccines, fluoride and drugs\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has announced he wants to appoint vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as the head of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The position has a broad remit across the US health industry, including food safety, pharmaceuticals, public health and vaccinations. If his post is confirmed by the US Senate, he would be in charge of key health agencies with about 80,000 employees and a trillion-dollar budget. RFK Jr has long expressed views that conflict with scientific evidence, especially on vaccines, and his nomination has provoked opposition from public health experts. But he has also adopted positions with popular support, scrutinising the use of food additives and urging that the power of big pharma be curbed. The nephew of President JFK, he ran for the White House himself as an independent but dropped out and backed Trump. As secretary, Kennedy would be in charge of huge agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This is where he stands on vaccines, food, fluoride and health agencies.\n\nThe vast majority of health experts champion inoculations for their long history of success - guarding against dangerous diseases and even eradicating deadly smallpox. But as founder of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, Kennedy has for nearly two decades been airing debunked claims about jabs. In recent years, he has gained prominence in the US for making the discredited claim that childhood immunisations are linked to autism. But he has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination and says he had his own children immunised. Kennedy has said that if he were to join the Trump administration, he would want to examine government vaccine safety data and share his findings with the public. He recently denied that he would block or ban vaccinations, however. \"If vaccines are working for somebody, I\u2019m not going to take them away. People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,\" he told NBC News last week. The stock prices of vaccine makers like Moderna, Pfizer and Merck fell after Trump announced his pick.\n\nAnnouncing Kennedy's nomination, Trump said Americans had for too long been \"crushed\" by food and drug companies engaging in \"deception, misinformation, and disinformation\". Kennedy has long blamed the food and drug industries - as well as the regulators who oversee them - for Americans' poor health. He has said that he wants to overhaul the systems that oversee pesticides, herbicides, food additives and pharmaceuticals. He has called for a ban on food dyes and additives, regularly citing Europe's regulatory standards. \"We have 1,000 ingredients in our food that are illegal in Europe that are illegal in other countries and they're making our kids sick,\" he alleged in an NBC News interview. \"They're there because of corruption in our agencies.\" An FDA spokesperson told the BBC that it is necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing estimates of authorised chemicals between the US and Europe. Both \"generally apply the same fundamental scientific approach to safety assessment when evaluating the safety of chemicals in food\", according to the FDA spokesperson. \"Different regulatory definitions and different methodologies can influence the results. Without clarity, comparisons can be misleading,\" the official added. Last month Kennedy accused the FDA on X, external of suppressing the use of \"psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, exercise, nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented\". He said that those who were \"part of this corrupt system\" should be prepared to \"pack your bags\". Both ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were held up as miracle cures for Covid but such claims have not been supported by science.\n\u2022 None What do we know about Covid and hydroxychloroquine\n\nKennedy recently vowed to remove fluoride - a cavity-fighting mineral - from the US drinking water, which about two-thirds of Americans have in their water supply. Though it is a decision made by state and local health authorities, Kennedy said on X earlier this month that \"the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water\". He alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists \"is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease\".\n\u2022 None Five takeaways from Trump's first week The US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health. Recent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products. Most of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water. Removing it altogether could still pose a challenge, however, as the federal government does not have the final authority over that decision.\n\nKennedy has long claimed that chronic health issues have worsened due to the inaction of federal health agencies. He said at a rally in Arizona earlier this month that he plans to fire and replace 600 employees at the NIH - which oversees vaccine research - as soon as Trump takes the White House. The longtime lawyer also said last month that he intends \"to have every nutritional scientist\" in the health and agriculture departments fired on day one of a Trump presidency because he alleges they are co-opted by corporate interests. He reportedly intends to take a serious look at those who work at other health agencies as well, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Its report says the Attorney General, Lord Hermer, was asked to intervene after the Met resisted the idea of providing that level of security - usually reserved for royals and top level politicians. The paper says the report puts more pressure on the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper - who is already facing questions about her role in the decision - but adds it is not clear who from the government asked Lord Hermer to get involved. The attorney general's office tells the Sunday Times that the operational decision on security for Swift was solely one for the police. \"Starmer steps into cabinet row to rescue global summit\" reads the Observer's headline. The paper focuses on what it describes as the \"explosive row\" after the Transport Secretary, Louise Haigh, branded P&O Ferries, external \"a rogue operator\". The comments threatened to overshadow Sir Keir's upcoming investment summit in London, when the owner of P&O reportedly pulled out of the event. The report says company representatives will now attend, and the prime minister and Haigh have \"spoken and made up\" after he appeared to rebuke her. The Sunday Mirror's front page focuses on a defiant plea from Sir Keir, as he marked his first 100 days as prime minister.

    "The King greets the crowd during a visit to St. Thomas's Anglican Church in Sydney\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla joined a church congregation in Sydney for a Sunday service on the first day of engagements during their tour of Australia. It is the King\u2019s first visit to Australia since he became the country\u2019s head of state in September 2022 and is the biggest trip the King has made since starting cancer treatment in February. Their six-day visit to the Commonwealth country will involve meeting political and community leaders, and also celebrating the nation's people, culture, and heritage. They were joined by members of St Thomas' Anglican Church in northern Sydney for the service, which was officiated by the city's archbishop, the Most Reverend Kanishka Raffel.\n\nThe royal couple met some well-wishers after a crowd of a couple of hundred people - many who had queued since early morning - were allowed into the church precinct to speak to the royal couple after the service. For most it was a snatched hello and a chance to hand over flowers or take a photo. Lyn Tarbuck attended with her husband Bob, a republican, and her two King Charles spaniels. She said of the monarchy: \u201cI think it\u2019s joined forces \u2013 if we have a problem in Australia they will help us out. We are a very big country but small in population so the more help we get the better.\u201d Roslyn Durie, who saw the Queen on her 1980 visit to Australia, said she was \"so emotional\" after receiving \"a good firm handshake\" from the King. Sandra Hall and her husband Peter were also there to greet the royal couple. Ms Hall said: \u201cI shook hands with Camilla first and welcomed her to Sydney, then Charles came along. I said 'look, it\u2019s a beautiful sunny day' - and he said 'it\u2019s always sunny in Sydney'.\u201d\n\nQueen Camilla speaks to the crowd outside the church on Sunday\n\nOutside the church, a small but noisy group of about 20 protesters shouted \u201cnot our King\". They held banners, one reading \"decolonise\", and waved Aboriginal and Palestinian flags. Wayne Wharton, an Indigenous Kooma protester from Brisbane, called out: \"I charge you, I charge the King \u2026 with crimes against the sovereign nations of this country \u2026 of war crimes against our people.\" \"I do not recognise the illegal occupation of this country,\u201d he said.

He also gave a speech to guests, in which he spoke of his \"great joy\" of visiting Australia for the first time as Sovereign, \"and to renew a love of this country and its people which I have cherished for so long\".

    "Fatal dog attack victim may have had epileptic fit\n\nKelly Reilly died in an attack which took place in a house on Wexford Road in Coventry\n\nA woman who was mauled to death by her pet dog may have suffered an epileptic seizure which triggered the attack, an inquest has heard. Kelly Reilly loved her dog \"like a baby\" before it caused severe injuries to her head and throat on July 22 in her maisonette in Wexford Road, Wood End, Coventry Coroner's Court heard. On Tuesday, area coroner Delroy Henry concluded her death was an accident after hearing that Ms Reilly, 33, often suffered with fits \"out of the blue\" which caused her to collapse \"with no recollection or control\". Her sister, Kirsty Reilly, said the dog, an American bulldog called Mendoza, had never shown aggressive behaviour before.\n\nShe told the court the pet had been adopted as a puppy in 2022. \"She loved it literally like a baby,\" she said. \"She was a lovely dog and if Kelly did not love her as much as she did I would have had her. \"She was really nice. She would sleep with Kelly in her bedroom.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Consultant pathologist Dr Hesham El-Daly, who performed a post-mortem examination, said Kelly Reilly sustained bruising to her head from the fall and suffered \"significant\" injuries consistent with a dog bite, including a severed throat. Dr El-Daly agreed that Ms Reilly did not sustain any defensive injuries, meaning the attack was either \"quick and ferocious\" or she was \"not in control of her body\", which is a feature of epilepsy. Concluding the inquest, Mr Henry said: \"Tragedy comes along through unintended actions with wholly unintended consequences, and in my mind that's what happened with Kelly here. \"I have seen before me a strong family demonstrating a strength by attending this inquest and the strength to listen to the evidence. \"I am sure that Kelly would be really proud of you.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Warwickshire",

    "Police Scotland have received a new allegation against former first minister Alex Salmond of a non-recent sexual assault. Salmond died suddenly last month after having a heart attack while attending a conference in North Macedonia. In 2020, he was cleared by a jury of 13 sexual offence charges, including attempted rape.\n\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for Police Scotland said: \u201cWe can confirm that we have received a report of a non-recent sexual assault. \"The information is being assessed.\u201d The force said it could not release any more information on the matter at this time.\n\nIt is unclear why the allegation has been made now. It would not be possible to bring a prosecution in respect of Salmond himself as he is dead. However, the police may investigate whether there is a suggestion of any other criminal offences committed by anyone else.\n\nThe Herald newspaper also reported that up to six women approached the SNP, external two years ago to complain about Salmond. The newspaper said the complaints were understood to be of a sexual nature, and were taken to party executives who did not take them any further. Quoting a \"party insider\" the paper said \"five or six\" complaints about \"inappropriate behaviour of a sexual nature\" were reported to the party, dating back as far as the 1980s. Salmond quit the SNP in 2018, and went on to set up an alternative independence supporting party, called Alba, of which he was the leader until he died. The SNP told BBC Scotland News that its disciplinary processes could only be invoked against current party members.\n\nAlex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon used to be close political allies\n\nAlba Party general secretary Chris McEleny said Salmond had been cleared by a court of law, and claimed the former first minister was the victim of a smear campaign. Mr McEleny also claimed allies of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon were behind the attacks on Salmond's character.\n\nSalmond was cleared of sexual offence charges after a trial in 2020. He had been charged with 13 offences, including attempted rape, but was acquitted on all counts after two weeks of evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh. The women who made the allegations against Salmond - which dated back to his time as first minister - had included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. During his evidence to the court, Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\" or \"exaggerations\". Salmond's lawyer told the court the former first minister \"could certainly have been a better man\" but had not committed any crimes. He said that his client had sometimes behaved badly, calling him \"touchy-feely\". Two subsequent inquiries into the conduct of ministers and officials saw Salmond asserting his belief that many in his former party had colluded against him in an effort to block his return to frontline politics.",
    "King Charles is said to have been reinvigorated by his trip to Australia and Samoa\n\nKing Charles is expected to return to a \"normal\" schedule of overseas trips next year after his visits to Australia and Samoa proved a \"perfect tonic\", a Buckingham Palace official has said. The positive message about his health and spirits comes at the end of his biggest overseas trip since he began cancer treatment - with a more regular diary of events expected at home and abroad in 2025. \"We're now working on a pretty normal looking, full overseas tour programme for next year, which is a high for us to end on,\" the palace aide said. Heckling by an Australian senator was said to have left the King \"completely unruffled\", with him seeing free speech as the \"cornerstone of democracy\".\n\nThe King was said to be a great believer in a holistic approach - of \"mind, body and soul\" - with his recent trip having a positive impact for all three. Continuing to work seems to be how the King wants to respond to his cancer diagnosis. That could include overseas visits in the spring and autumn of 2025, subject to his doctors' approval. \"He has genuinely loved this tour. He has genuinely thrived on the programme. It's lifted his spirits, his mood and his recovery. In that sense, the tour - despite its demands - has been the perfect tonic,\" said the palace official. \"It is hard to overstate the joy that he takes from duty and service and being in public and seeing those crowds engaging with communities across the spectrum. That really does lift the spirits. You can see that.\" His cancer treatment had been paused during his travels but is expected to begin again as he returns home. On doctors' advice, the trip did not include a further leg to New Zealand. King Charles, who left Samoa on Saturday morning, appeared to cope well with the busy schedules of the visits, with multiple engagements on many of the days, including some controversial moments. After a speech to parliamentarians in the Australian capital Canberra he was heckled by an independent senator, Lidia Thorpe, who shouted \"You are not my King\", in a protest about Indigenous people's rights. That was said to have left the King untroubled. \"He was completely unruffled. He's been around a long time. As always, [he] kept calm, carried on. He believes free speech is the cornerstone of democracy, and so everyone is entitled to their views,\" the royal official said. At the Commonwealth summit in Samoa, there was an ongoing debate over whether there should be reparations or an apology from the UK over the slave trade. But such decisions depend on the government rather than the monarch - and the King's speech talked of learning the lessons of history. The King was also said to have been greatly supported by Queen Camilla accompanying him on the tour. \u201cThe King gets great strength from the Queen being there, not least when she keeps it real,\" said a palace official.",

There were chaotic scenes in parts of Beirut late on Sunday, as people tried to get to areas that they thought would be safer and multiple explosions were heard. The Israeli military said it targeted money held by Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH). It offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support, but Israel and the US accuse it of being a cover for the Iran-backed group to fund its activities. There was no immediate comment from AQAH or Hezbollah.\n\nThe attacks appeared to mark an expansion of Israel\u2019s war against Hezbollah, going beyond military infrastructure used by the group. They took place hours before US President Joe Biden\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East arrived in Beirut to explore the possibility of a negotiated end to the war. Israel began an intense air campaign and ground invasion against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel. More than 2,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 1,800 in the past five weeks, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Israeli authorities say 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nThe Israeli air strikes targeting branches of AQAH happened about 20 minutes after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders, at around 21:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Sunday. According to the Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency (NNA), there were 11 attacks on Dahieh, in southern Beirut. Videos posted on social media showed one AQAH branch on fire in the Laylaki area, external, only 500m (1,800ft) away from the runway of Lebanon\u2019s only functioning commercial airport, and another just to the north in Burj al-Barajneh. A third video showed a multi-storey building where there was an AQAH branch collapsing in the Chiyah area, external. The NNA also said that strikes hit branches in Nabatieh, Tyre and Shehabieh in southern Lebanon, as well as those in the eastern Bekaa Valley towns of Baalbek, Hermel and Rayak - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. \"Our store and our livelihood are gone,\u201d business owner Ahmed told Reuters news agency outside a severely damaged AQAH branch in Zahrani. \u201cThis neighbourhood is all civilian, with nothing here.\u201d It was not clear whether the strikes targeting AQAH caused any casualties. But the NNA reported on Monday that six women and children were killed in an air strike on a home in Baalbek, and that two bodies were recovered from a destroyed building in the southern town of Srifa.\n\nA multi-storey building in the Beirut suburb of Chiyah was destroyed by a strike\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck \u201cdozens of facilities and sites\u201d across Lebanon that were used by Hezbollah to \u201cfinance its terrorist activities\u201d. It alleged that Hezbollah stored billions of dollars at branches of AQAH, and that it used the money to purchase weapons and pay members of its military wing. \u201cThe purpose of these strikes is to target the ability of Hezbollah to function both during the war but also afterwards, to rebuild and to rearm the organisation on the day after, and [to target] the grip Hezbollah has on large parts of the Lebanese society,\u201d an Israeli intelligence official told reporters. Hezbollah - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and others - is more than just a Shia Islamist armed group. It is also a political party with representation in parliament, and a social movement, engrained in Lebanese society, with significant support. AQAH is a key part of Hezbollah\u2019s social services network. Before the Israeli strikes, it had more than 30 branches, often located on the ground floor of residential buildings. Many people came to depend on AQAH after Lebanon sank into a deep economic crisis five years ago, causing the local currency to lose 90% of its value and commercial banks to restrict foreign currency withdrawals. The association allowed people to take out small, interest-free loans in dollars backed by gold or a guarantor, and to open savings accounts. Hezbollah\u2019s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech in 2021 that AQAH had provided $3.7bn (\u00a32.8bn) in loans to 1.8 million people in Lebanon since it was founded in the early 1980s, and that around 300,000 people had loans with it at that time. Nasrallah also claimed that AQAH had been strengthened by the US sanctions imposed since 2007, when American officials said the association was being used by Hezbollah as a cover to manage its financial activities and to gain access to the international financial system. A Hezbollah press officer told the BBC on Monday afternoon that neither the group nor AQAH had issued any statements regarding the air strikes. Earlier, a statement attributed to AQAH was circulated on social media which said people's deposits with the association were \u201csafe\u201d.\n\nThe Israeli military also announced on Monday that its troops were continuing to carry out operations in southern Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure and weaponry. Hezbollah fighters meanwhile continued to fire rockets into northern Israel, with the military reporting that 60 projectiles had crossed the border by Monday afternoon. About 200 projectiles were detected on Sunday, when the military said its warplanes had conducted \"an intelligence-based strike on a command centre of Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and an underground weapons workshop in Beirut\". Also on Sunday, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) accused Israeli forces of deliberately demolishing an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN peacekeeping position in the southern town of Marwahin. It followed similar incidents in recent weeks. In a separate development, the Lebanese army said three of its soldiers were killed after a military vehicle was hit by an Israeli air strike in Nabatieh, southern Lebanon. Lebanon's army has historically stayed out of cross-border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah - but a number of its troops have been killed in Israeli attacks since fighting escalated last month. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the two incidents.",

    "Spain has fined five budget airlines a total of \u20ac179m (\u00a3149m) for \"abusive practices\" including charging for hand luggage. Ryanair has been given the largest fine of \u20ac108m (\u00a390m), while EasyJet has received a penalty of \u20ac29m (\u00a324m). Vueling, Norwegian and Volotea were issued with sanctions by Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry on Friday. The ministry said it plans to ban practices such as charging extra for carry-on hand luggage and reserving seats for children.\n\nThe fines are the biggest sanction issued by the ministry, and follow an investigation into the budget airline industry. The ministry said it had upheld fines that were first announced in May after dismissing appeals lodged by the companies. Vueling, the budget arm of British Airways owner IAG, has been fined \u20ac39m (\u00a332m), while Norwegian Airlines and Volotea have been fined \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.3m) and \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) respectively. The fines were issued because the airlines were found to have provided misleading information and were not transparent with prices, \"which hinders consumers' ability to compare offers\" and make informed decisions, the ministry said. Ryanair was accused of violating a range of consumer rights, including charging for larger carry-on luggage, seat selection, and asking for \"a disproportionate amount\" to print boarding passes at terminals. Each fine was calculated based on the \"illicit profit\" obtained by each airline from these practices. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the fines were \"illegal\" and \"baseless\", adding that he will appeal the case and take it to the EU courts. \"Ryanair has for many years used bag fees and airport check-in fees to change passenger behaviour and we pass on these cost savings in the form of lower fares to consumers,\" he said. Easyjet and Norwegian said they would also appeal the decision. The Spanish airline industry association, ALA, plans a further appeal and has called the ministry's decision \"nonsense\", arguing the fine infringes EU free market rules. But Andr\u00e9s Barrag\u00e1n, secretary general for consumer affairs and gambling at the ministry, defended the fines, saying the government's decision was based on Spanish and EU law. \"It is an abuse to charge \u20ac20 for just printing the boarding card in the airport, [it's] something no one wants,\" he told the BBC's World Business Report programme. \"This is a problem consumers are facing not only in Spain but in other EU countries.\" Consumer rights association Facua, which has campaigned against the fees for six years, said the decision was \"historic\".",

    "Kate Nash says OnlyFans will earn more than tour\n\nKate Nash is best known for her 2007 hit Foundations\n\nSinger Kate Nash says she thinks she will make more money from selling photos of her bottom on OnlyFans than she will from her concerts, after joining the platform because it's \"a really difficult time for artists to tour\". Under the slogan \"Butts for tour buses\", the musician announced on Thursday that her OnlyFans income will subsidise her shows because \"touring makes losses not profits\". \"I also think it's bit of a punk protest as a woman to take control of my body and sell it to be able to fund my passion project, which is actually my 18-year career,\" she explained. \"I want to highlight that, and I want people to talk about it, and I want people to know the truth about what what's happening in the music business.\"\n\nNash, who has just finished a three-week US tour, started her UK dates in Glasgow on Thursday, and will then move on to Europe. Her date at London's Koko is sold out. \"I'm losing money from those tours,\" she told BBC News. \"The only way I could find to make a profit on the tour - you're either going, hopefully I sell enough T-shirts to cover the debt, or you cut people's wages, or you fire band and crew, or you travel dangerously.\" She wasn't willing to cut corners or the quality of her shows, she said. \"So that leaves me in a position where I'm not profiting from tours. So is this a job, or is it a passion project?\" She also said it was \"an important time for women to take control and to feel empowered\", and that she often posted photos of her posterior anyway. The pictures she's posted on OnlyFans so far are revealing but not explicit. \"I think the arse is the perfect combination of comedy and sexuality,\" she said. \"I actually like bums. I think they're just quite great. I think it's funny. I enjoy taking pictures of my bum. Always been a bit of a flasher. So I'm going to enjoy doing it, and I'm already putting it online anyway. \"I'm going to probably make more money doing that than the music over the next three months.\"\n\nNash, who released her fifth studio album in June, also told fans on Instagram: \"No need to stream my music, I\u2019m good for the 0.003 of a penny per stream thanks.\" Last month, fellow singer Lily Allen revealed she makes more money by selling pictures of her feet on OnlyFans than she does from Spotify streams. Meanwhile, in recent months, acts including Rachel Chinouriri, Ratboy and The Duke Spirit singer Liela Moss have all cancelled tours, blaming the costs. Nash highlighted a survey from recording and rehearsal studio network Pirate, which said most artists have not seen an increase in gig fees in recent years despite a rise in ticket prices. \"Festival prices and ticket prices have gone up drastically, but the musicians' wage hasn't,\" she said. \"So you might be playing a venue that you've played multiple times and you can sell it out, [but] you're getting the same fee that you did 10 years ago, probably. But all the other costs have gone up.\"\n\nLily Allen sells pictures of her feet on OnlyFans\n\nSome corporations make big profits from music, as do a \"select few\" artists, she said. \"But the majority are losing money, and we are also creating an environment where the industry is saying, we don't want diversity in music, because we don't want working class people to be able to afford to do this.\" Musicians could follow a lead from people who earn a living from selling sexual content on sites like OnlyFans, she suggested. \"You've got all this control, and you're deciding what you want to do and how you want to do it, and people want to pay you for it. \"We just haven't taught any of those lessons to anyone with music and art - that art is so valuable and so worthwhile in our lives and so meaningful. We\u2019re totally happy to devalue it. \"Where can we learn from the sex workers? Maybe we can learn something from this industry. How do we get empowered as artists and take a bit more control?\"",

    "India all out for 46 against NZ in first Test\n\nNew Zealand had never dismissed a side for as little as 46 in a Test\n\nIndia were bowled out for 46 by New Zealand on day two of the first Test in Bengaluru. After the entire first day was washed out by rain, India chose to bat on a lively, seaming pitch and were dismissed for the third-lowest total in their Test history. Virat Kohli, Sarfaraz Khan, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin were all out for ducks, with seamers Matt Henry and Will O'Rourke taking 5-15 and 4-22 respectively. Rishabh Pant with 20 and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who made 13, were the only batters to make double figures for India, who are top of the World Test Championship standings. It was India's lowest total in a home Test, only beaten by their 36 all out against Australia in Adelaide in 2020 and 42 against England at Lord's in 1974. New Zealand reached 180-3 by the close, giving them complete control of the Test with a lead of 134.

Sometimes you make the right call and sometimes, you don't,\" India captain Rohit Sharma said. \"I'm hurting a little bit because I made that call... the challenges that were thrown at us, we didn't respond to well and found ourselves in a situation where we got bowled out for 46. \"As a captain, it definitely hurts to see that number.\"\n\nJaiswal and Sharma had edged to 9-0 in the seventh over when Rohit was bowled by Tim Southee as he advanced to attempt a wild drive. Kohli did not score in his nine balls before gloving 23-year-old O'Rourke, playing his fifth Test, to leg slip. Sarfaraz was caught one-handed by Conway diving at mid-off attempting a counter-attack and, after a short rain delay and a 10-over partnership returning just 21 runs with Pant, Jaiswal cut O'Rourke to point. Rahul was caught down the leg side in O'Rourke's next over and an over later, Jadeja skied a catch off a leading edge and Ashwin edged to gully in consecutive balls off Henry. Henry's next over returned the wicket of Pant, who poked an edge to second slip, and it was Henry who produced a fine sprawling catch soon after to pouch Jasprit Bumrah's top-edge at fine leg. Henry then claimed his fourth Test five-wicket haul by having Kuldeep Yadav caught in the gully. India's total was the joint 18th-lowest by any team in Tests. \"We were going to bat first too so it was a good toss to lose,\" Henry said. \"It was nice when the clouds rolled in when the toss was done. \"We were expecting it to be a flatter wicket but there was plenty of assistance this morning.\"\n\u2022 None Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",
    "Residents of Lebanese border town 'determined to stay' as rockets fly above\n\nSince the start of the Israel-Hezbollah war, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have fled their homes because of the fighting. But the residents of one town right in the combat zone have decided to stay. Rmeish, just 2km (1.2 miles) from the border, is home to 7,000 Maronite Christians - and surrounded by firing on all sides. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of damage. Maybe 90% of houses have damage of some kind, glass smashed and cracks in the walls. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen when winter comes,\u201d says Jiries al-Alam, a farmer who also works as an undertaker with the town\u2019s church. \u201cWe are determined to stay but hardly anyone sleeps at night because of the air strikes. Thankfully, there\u2019s been no deaths among the residents so far, but 200 of my cattle died from the military flares,\u201d he adds.\n\nRmeish is the only Lebanese border town that has not been directly ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military\n\nA day after Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, its Lebanese ally Hezbollah began launching rockets into northern Israel, which in turn, started to strike Lebanon. The residents of Rmeish began seeing rockets flying in both directions above them. \u201cLots of families raised white flags on their homes and cars to say that they are peaceful and have no link to what is happening,\u201d says Father George al-Ameel, 44, a priest and teacher in the town. \u201cWe want to stay in our homes and don\u2019t want any war in our town.\u201d\n\nFather George al-Ameel says the town is peaceful and that residents want to stay\n\nAfter Israel began its ground invasion of Lebanon on 1 October this year, the war drew closer to Rmeish, with heavy fighting taking place in two villages both less than 1.6km away. \u201cWe were staying in our house for months, then the air strikes started getting very close and suddenly our house was hit, we were forced to leave in the middle of the night,\u201d says Rasha Makhbour, 38. \u201cPeople\u2019s work has stopped and no-one goes out, our children\u2019s school is shut, everything has changed.\u201d Rasha\u2019s family of six moved to another house in the centre of town after theirs became uninhabitable. \u201cWe believe the rockets that hit our home came from the south, not from our country,\u201d she says. The Israel Defense Forces told the BBC that there were \u201cno known IDF strikes\u201d on Rmeish during the dates Rasha Makhbour\u2019s house was damaged, claiming it was a \u201cfailed launch by Hezbollah\u201d.\n\nThe roof of Rasha Makhbour's home was hit and damaged\n\nIsrael has issued a general evacuation order for the south of Lebanon since its ground invasion began. The UN says over 640,000 people have been displaced from there as they flee the fighting. The Israeli government says that its military goals in southern Lebanon are to push back Hezbollah and return 60,000 Israelis displaced from its northern border towns to their homes.\n\nOn the border with Israel, Rmeish is the only Lebanese town that has not been directly ordered to leave. While neither side has directly threatened the residents of Rmeish during the conflict, they have had their loyalty to Lebanon questioned. \u201cThere\u2019s been voices under the table spreading rumours that our presence here is evidence of our collaboration with Israel, the enemy. We completely reject this,\u201d says Father al-Ameel. It is a message reiterated by Rmeish\u2019s mayor, Milad al-Alam. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no guarantees of safety from any side,\u201d he says. \u201cOur town is peaceful, and our only cause is to stay for our identity and our country.\u201d\n\nJiries al-Alam says essential supplies are running out in Rmeish\n\nUntil the start of Israel\u2019s ground invasion, a Lebanese army unit had stayed in Rmeish and helped organise movement in and out of the town. But as Israeli forces moved to cross the border, the Lebanese army \u2013 which is not directly involved in the war \u2013 decided to pull out of Rmeish, much to the distress of locals. The Lebanese army said it rejected the description that they have \u2018withdrawn\u2019 from border locations, referring the BBC to a statement that the army is \u201crepositioning\u201d a number of military units in the south. Then at the end of October, the main route out of Rmeish itself was hit \u2013 leaving residents feeling further isolated and vulnerable. Since then, just one aid convoy has reached the town with the coordination of UN peacekeeping forces, the Unifil mission said. \u201cWe have needs for fuel, foods and medicines, there was a delivery coming from Tyre that had to turn around,\u201d says Father al-Ameel. \u201cIf someone is hurt, there\u2019s no hospital for serious medical care.\u201d Mayor Al-Alam tells us he is optimistic that the route out of town will be regularly usable again soon, so they can fill up their fuel reserves, even if the route through an active warzone is dangerous. Others in the town remain anxious. \u201cThe situation is really bad. There are no goods, no food or fuel coming through. We\u2019re starting to see items going missing from the shelves,\u201d says Jiries al-Alam, the town undertaker. \u201cBut we\u2019ll find a way through. Now is the olive season and in the worst case we can just eat olives. We want to stay in our homes and so we will die in our homes if we have to.\u201d",

    "Harris set to give speech after congratulating Trump on win\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nKamala Harris is preparing to speak to the US public later on Wednesday after calling Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory. The defeated Democrat spoke to her rival on Wednesday afternoon and they discussed \"the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans\", a Harris aide told journalists. Harris cancelled her expected election night appearance at Howard University in Washington DC, as her prospects of victory began to recede. The current vice-president is now expected to speak at the venue at 16:00 EST (21:00 GMT).\n\nShe did not concede on election night, despite it becoming clear by the early hours of Wednesday that her Republican rival had secured enough votes in key swing states to win. Trump has now won enough key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin, to secure the presidency, with several states left to declare. Trump is also beating Harris in the popular vote - the first Republican to lead nationally since George W Bush in 2004. In a statement, Trump described his victory as one \"our country has never seen before\". \"I will fight for you, for your family, and your future. Every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body,\" he told voters. He vowed to \"unlock America's glorious destiny\" and promised his presidency would deliver \"the golden age of America\". As expected, Trump stormed to victory in conservative strongholds across the US, while Harris won liberal states from New York to California.\n\nHarris saw a surge in popularity after she became the Democratic Party's nominee in June following Joe Biden's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate. Her team sought to strike a more optimistic vision than the portrait of American decay presented by Trump, focusing heavily on securing abortion rights. Trump, by contrast, frequently targeted Harris with highly personal attacks during the campaign, variously calling the vice-president \"stupid\", \"lazy\", and \"dumb as a rock\". He also questioned her racial identity during the early stages of the campaign. In a message to staff, Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillion, said losing the election was \"unfathomably hard\" and will take a \"long time to process\". \"But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump presidency starts now,\" she said in an email obtained by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. \"I know the vice president isn\u2019t finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. How swing state voters in Georgia felt on election day\n\nThe former California senator was running to become the first woman, black woman and South Asian-American to win the presidency. Exit poll data suggests that the Democratic nominee may have under-performed with women. Some 54% of female voters cast their ballots for her, below the 57% of women Joe Biden won in 2020. Black and Latino voters also appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, exit poll data suggested. The campaign faced criticism at times for its failure to expand on a clear economic message, an issue which was extremely important to Americans who have faced several years of rising inflation.\n\nAbout 86 million voters cast their ballots early during one of the most turbulent campaigns in recent American history. The Republican party enjoyed a resurgence across the country, winning a number of key congressional battles in key states and taking back control of the Senate. The Republicans wrested two seats in West Virginia and Ohio from the Democrats and saw off a stiff challenge in Texas. Neither party seemed to have an overall edge in the House, which Republicans narrowly control. If the party does regain control of both chambers, it would make it easier for Trump to push through his agenda - which includes mass deportations of illegal migrants and sweeping tax cuts.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

    "An Iranian response to Israel's attack would further escalate a volatile situation in the Middle East\n\nThe US and Israel \"will definitely receive a crushing response\", Iran's supreme leader has said, following an Israeli attack on Iran a week ago. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the comments while speaking to students on Saturday ahead of the 45th anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the US embassy in Tehran. The threat comes as Iran assesses whether and how to respond to Israel's attack last month, that Iran said killed four soldiers, which was in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack against Israel earlier in October. The Iranian attack came in response to the killings of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas - Iranian-backed armed groups fighting Israel - and a senior Iranian commander.\n\nKhamenei said Iran's enemies, including Israel and the US, \"will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran, the Iranian people, and the resistance front\". Iran's so-called \"axis of resistance\" is an alliance of Tehran-backed groups that include Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states. Israel is said to have inflicted severe damage on Iranian air defences and missile capacities in its 26 October attack, even though Iran has not admitted this. Israel sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks which killed about 1,200 people on 7 October last year. More than 250 were also taken into the Gaza Strip as hostages. Since then, Israel has launched a major operation in Gaza, during which more than 43,300 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel also went on the offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon in September, after almost a year of cross-border fighting and rocket fire, which Hezbollah had launched in support of Palestinians the day after the Hamas attacks. Israel said it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents from northern Israel displaced by the conflict. More than 2,800 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, and 1.2 million others displaced, according to Lebanese authorities. Israeli authorities say more than 60 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket, drone, and missile attacks in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. Relations between the US and Iran have not properly stabilised since 4 November 1979, when Iranian protesters seized more than 50 US diplomats and embassy staff, triggering a hostage drama that lasted 444 days.",
