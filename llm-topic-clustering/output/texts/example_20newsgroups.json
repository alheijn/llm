It's been done so much, that it \nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.

I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\n\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\n\nDean again:\n\n\"You made an ass of yourself\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\n\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\n\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\n\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\nthe basis of one insult after another.",

    "from Dean:\n\nYes, you're right. After going home and reading the paper, I got the\nfull details. That's what I get for making a post based on WDUQ's news.\nI should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong.",
    "\nQuestion:\nIf a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-\nby 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally\nvaluable as a player who plays in all of them.\n\n\nSince the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how \n\"transferable\" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average\nstandard deviation in the league be used?\n\nI am interested in seeing each method.\nBut I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.",
    "Distribution: usa\nReply-To: lihan@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu\n\nWhile I'm on the net bugging everyone, is there such a thing as a chip\nor chipset to decode Code 39 barcode?  I ask for a couple of reasons --\nmainly I want a reasonably compact encoding scheme to write information\non magstripe cards and Code 39 appears to be about right.  (If the 'right'\nway to do it is something else, and it's reasonably easy, can someone let\nme know?)\n\nI might not get a chance to reply too quickly to this or my earlier post,\nbut I'll get to them within a couple days, I think ..",
    "\n\tTrue (especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature).\n\n\n\n\tLow power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE\nhave significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice\nwhile wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity\nis available in other crystal types, which unfortunately\nare larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more\nbattery power.  \n\n\tProgrammable timers might be less accurate, but they\nare more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.",

    "# 74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n# \tpower consumption.

(My part was slow & parallel, whew.) The mild-mannered designer\nworking on the fast (serial) stuff cussed & swore at 74F all the time.\nIt was the Harry Reams of TTL. One ultra-tiny power line glitch, one\nhickup, one eyeblink across the board, and bang - the F had\ntoggled/counted/whatevered.  At times he swore it would count even\nwithout any 5 volt supply ;-} You can guess what the \"F\" stood for....\n\nThey would do anything to push S or work around it to avoid using F. I\ndon't think I'd consider using F to replace S unless the consequences\nwere *fully* understood.......",
    "\nNever was?  Probably.  Is not now?  Debatable.  What other valid test can\nyou think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner?  What\ndo you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football?  What a\njoke!\n\n\nIf I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't\nall that bad a hockey player.\n\nBut let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years:\n\n??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle-\nton, so I'll call this one a +.\n\nBarry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks).  +++.  Any questions?\n\nGreg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers). ++.  Didja see that one Rosie\nroofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?\n\nCourtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender,\nRanford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always\nseems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall\nas a defensive liability?\n\nKen Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?\n\nJanney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and\na personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?\n\nSo,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who \nelse (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes\nout on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not\nin spite of him.\n\nBTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet \nthey finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:\nPittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if\nthese five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.\n\nIn summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I\nsuspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be\nthat team that Lindros didn't want to play for.\n\n\n-- \nDan Lyddy    daniell@cory.berkeley.edu    University of California at Berkeley",
    "Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of\nCivil Rights.
