    "Trump revellers gather in Florida to await his arrival\n\nMusk has been campaigning hard for Trump in Pennsylvania, where polls suggest Trump is in a tie with his Democratic rival\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man, planned to spend election night with Donald Trump in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago resort, he said on X/Twitter. Mr Musk, the owner of Tesla and X, has aggressively campaigned for the Republican candidate in swing states across the country. Trump's campaign is also hosting a watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center for thousands of supporters. The tech billionaire has emerged as one of the most important backers of Trump and donated more than $119m (\u00a391.6m) this election cycle to America PAC - a political action committee he created to support the former president.\n\nMr Musk announced his support for the former president earlier this year, despite saying in 2022 that \"it's time for Trump to hang up his hat and sail into the sunset\". He posted a photo of himself on Tuesday saying he voted in Cameron County, Texas - where some of his companies are headquartered - before heading to Florida. Later in the evening, he wrote on X, \"Game, set and match\". The campaign was feeling confident late on Tuesday as supporters gathered at Trump's headquarters in the Palm Beach convention centre to wait for results. At one point, the crowd broke into a dance celebration to YMCA. Huge cheers erupted in the crowd as the state of Florida was projected as a win for Trump, albeit a win that was never in doubt. Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard arrived at the party, after previously attending Trump's more exclusive watch party at Mar-a-Lago. \"There's a lot of really excited people there\" who were \"cautiously optimistic\", she told the BBC. Steve Witkoff, a close friend of Trump, was also with him at Mar-a-Lago. There was \"a strong feeling of excitement and purpose\", he said.\n\nThe crowd included Blake Marnell, who often wore a brick-patterned suit to Trump events in support of Trump's as-yet unfounded promise to build a wall along the southern border. He said he was feeling very optimistic about his candidate's chances. Sergio Ramirez, a businessman originally from El Salvador, claimed Trump could only lose if the Democrats \"cheated... I don\u2019t see how she can win \u2014 Kamala wasn\u2019t a popular candidate.\" Michael, dressed in a \u201cBlacks for Trump 2024\u201d T-shirt. \u201cWe outnumbered them in early voting and we outnumber them now\u201d, he claims. At a formalwear event next door in the Hilton hotel, Iowa Republican delegate Deborah Yanna said it felt like \"Christmas morning\". \"When President Trump takes the White House back, he\u2019s going to make America sparkle again,\" she said. Elsewhere, Steve Bannon, former chief strategist of the Trump White House, plans to hold an election watch party tonight at the Willard Hotel - the five-star Washington DC hotel that served as the \"command centre\" for Trump loyalists seeking to overturn the 2020 election results. Bannon was released from federal prison one week ago, after serving four months behind bars for contempt of the US Congress. Kamala Harris will spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater and a historically black university in Washington DC.",
    "Lando Norris has won in Miami, the Netherlands and Singapore so far this season\n\nLando Norris says he and McLaren will be able to call 2024 a success even if they do not succeed in beating Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen to the title. Norris heads into this weekend's United States Grand Prix, the first of the final six races of the season, 52 points adrift of Verstappen. Briton Norris won the previous race in Singapore four weeks ago with Verstappen second. Norris said: \"We\u2019re fighting against the best of the best but no matter what it has still been a successful season.\" The gap between Verstappen and Norris equates to an average of nearly nine points a race - more than the gap between first and second places. It has narrowed from 78 points following the Belgian Grand Prix, four races ago.\n\nNorris said: \"If I finish second it\u2019s because Red Bull and Max have done a better job. \"We started (the season) a long way behind. Everyone thought Max was going to have an easy win. \"For that not to be the case after the gap they had after race one, it\u2019s still a year to be proud of. \"But as the season goes on, you always reevaluate what are our expectations and now we are a top team and fighting for drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championships. \"I\u2019ve been doing a good job. I have been happy with the job I have been doing and what we are doing as a team and confident if we keep our heads down and keep pushing, we can close the gap. \"It\u2019s not easy, we need more than me first and Max second but I can\u2019t change that, just keep my head down and focus on myself.\" Verstappen has won seven races this season to Norris' three but has not taken the chequered flag first since the Spanish Grand Prix in June. Speaking in Austin on Thursday, the Dutchman said: \"It\u2019s 50-50 - yes or no. There is a lot that can go well or go wrong in these six races, plus sprint races as well. Nothing is guaranteed from both sides. I prefer not to think too much and live weekend to weekend. From now on, every weekend is crucial.\" Norris said McLaren\u2019s belief changed after he took his maiden F1 victory in Miami in early May, but he acknowledged that he and the team had made some mistakes that had stopped them narrowing the gap quicker. \"(There are) races we kind of regret not winning, probably Silverstone being the main one that didn\u2019t go our way when it should have done,\" he said. \"And we look back on that with a bit of regret that we didn\u2019t end up in better positions than we did. \"From Silverstone there was more focus from everyone, including the mechanics and engineers, because it became more and more real that we were in a position we had worked very hard to be in. \"I\u2019m loving it... there is more pressure and a few more nerves but I am still very relaxed and chilled about it.\"",
    "Why there is silence on Ten Hag's Man Utd future\n\nErik ten Hag has been Manchester United manager since 2022\n\nManchester United held a monthly board meeting in central London on Tuesday which the BBC reported as being significant in determining the immediate future of United manager Erik ten Hag. The meeting lasted around six hours, with footage of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe arriving and leaving published by some media. After the big build-up, silence. We don't know the outcome because no-one is saying. Last summer, United took just over two weeks from their FA Cup final win over Manchester City to confirm Ten Hag would continue in his job, after days of speculation before and after the game that the Dutchman would be sacked. The BBC reported that United were considering other managers as part of that review. When Ineos decided to stick with Ten Hag, they triggered the option for an additional year on his contract, which now runs to 2026.\n\nIn addition, significant elements of Ten Hag's backroom team were changed, including the exits of assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag and coach Steve McClaren. To add to the sense of change, in July Dan Ashworth and Omar Berrada finally came off respective periods of gardening leave to take up the sporting director and chief executive roles. This created the structures which Ineos felt United had lacked prior to Ratcliffe's part purchase of the club, which had been announced on 24 December the previous year. After an eighth-place finish, the club's worst of the Premier League era, optimism was high around Old Trafford about a significant improvement. On 29 September, United were hammered 3-0 at home by Tottenham. Questions began to be posed again about Ten Hag's tenure. On 30 September, officials at United let it be known that Ten Hag would stay in his job for the forthcoming games against Porto and Aston Villa. It was not stated the situation would be reassessed after those games, but that was an interpretation some made externally.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Friday, when asked directly in an on-camera interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan whether he \"had faith\" in Ten Hag, Ratcliffe replied: \"I don't want to answer that question. I like Erik. I think he's a very good coach but at the end of the day, it's not my call, it's the management team that's running Manchester United that have to decide how best we run the team in many different respects. \"They've not been there a long time, so they need to take stock and make some sensible decisions. \"Our objective is very clear \u2013 we want to take Manchester United back to where it should be, and it's not there yet, obviously \u2013 that's very clear.\" Ratcliffe's words made headlines - but were also interpreted by some as an indication some kind of decision would be reached after the Villa game. Ratcliffe, Berrada and Ashworth were part of the United delegation at Villa Park, who were all pictured sat together - alongside former manager Sir Alex Ferguson - at the top of the main stand for the 0-0 draw, which dropped United to 14th in the Premier League. Eight points from their opening seven games is United's worst return since the 1989-90 campaign.\n\nSo, after a week featuring two draws in very different styles - a chaotic 3-3 in Porto and a dour 0-0 at Villa - I asked Ten Hag two questions in his post-match news conference, firstly about the external noise and secondly if he felt the owners were still behind him. \"Simon, you said it very good, external noise,\" he replied. \"Internally we are disappointed and we know we have to do better.\u201d And on support from the ownership: \"I don't have any idea it is different because they should have told me. We communicate very open and very transparent.\" By Monday, some sort of clarification was expected from the club, which didn't come. Ratcliffe and co-chairman Joel Glazer were pictured going into Old Trafford. Glazer, it transpired, was attending a meeting of the club's Fan's Advisory Board. Club officials did communicate it was likely the performance of the team would be discussed at the board meeting in London the following day. Attendees were captured arriving and leaving but since then, nothing. Those at United whose responsibility it is to communicate messaging have questioned why they should offer guidance around this board meeting when they never do at any other point. As far as official statements go, there has been nothing. I approached United board member and Ineos Sport chief executive Jean-Claude Blanc for a comment at the European Clubs' Association meeting in Athens he is attending on his club's behalf. He politely declined. For now, Ten Hag remains in his job and he is having a few days away from the club as is customary during an international break. So unless the situation changes, he will return to begin preparations for the Premier League game with Brentford at Old Trafford on 19 October.",
    "A retired police officer is under a criminal investigation over the wrongful conviction of Andy Malkinson for a rape he did not commit, the police watchdog has said. The former Greater Manchester Police officer is being investigated for allegedly perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office in relation to Mr Malkinson\u2019s trial 20 years ago, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said. The former officer and three other officers, who are also retired, are also being investigated for alleged gross misconduct. Mr Malkinson was exonerated last year after suffering the longest miscarriage of justice of the 21st century.\n\nMr Malkinson protested his innocence throughout his 17 years in jail\n\nMr Malkinson said he felt vindicated by the IOPC investigation but he would \"not be satisfied until officers face real consequences\". \"If Greater Manchester Police get away with what they did to me, they'll keep doing it. It's as simple as that,\" he said. Judges at the Court of Appeal were told of long-undisclosed DNA evidence that showed another man must have been the rapist in an attack on a woman in 2003. No forensic evidence ever linked Mr Malkinson to the victim and he did not bear a facial injury that she had inflicted upon her attacker as she fought to defend herself. He did not look like her initial description of the rapist and there was no evidence to link him to the secluded scene of the crime, near Bolton. Mr Malkinson spent 17 years in jail protesting his innocence and a major judge-led inquiry is continuing into how the wrong man was convicted. The decision to investigate the four officers comes after the IOPC took over a review into how GMP had itself handled complaints from Mr Malkinson. An IOPC statement said that it was looking at how GMP came to identify Mr Malkinson as the key suspect and whether witnesses had been offered incentives to pick him out.\n\nThe watchdog said it was also investigating whether there had been a failure to disclose information that may have helped Mr Malkinson at his trial and it was also looking at whether officers followed the \u201cappropriate processes\u201d in how Mr Malkinson had been identified. The watchdog said it was also investigating how GMP handled and disposed of evidence. During Mr Malkinson\u2019s successful appeal last year, it emerged that the original DNA samples recovered from the victim and her clothing had been destroyed. Catherine Bates, IOPC Regional Director, said: \u201cMr Malkinson is a victim of one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history. \u201cFollowing a detailed review of evidence spanning a period of more than 20 years, we have now informed four retired GMP officers that they are under investigation for potential gross misconduct. \u201cOne of the officers has also been notified that they are under criminal investigation for potential misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice in relation to their actions during the police investigation and subsequent trial. \u201cWe will continue to keep Mr Malkinson and GMP updated on our progress.\u201d Emily Bolton, Mr Malkinson's lawyer at the legal charity APPEAL, welcomed the IOPC\u2019s decision to continue its investigation. \"Andy's wrongful imprisonment was not an unavoidable accident,\u201d she said. \u201cPolice accountability isn't optional - it's essential. Andy, his family, and the rape victim in this case all deserve justice.\"",
    "Israeli strikes on Iran kill four soldiers, Iran says\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Projectiles seen in sky over Tehran as Israel hits Iranian targets\n\nIsraeli strikes on Iran, in retaliation for Iran's missile attacks earlier this month, have killed four Iranian soldiers, Iran's army said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted missile factories and other sites near Tehran and western Iran early on Saturday. Iran's Foreign Ministry said it has a responsibility to defend itself, but added that Iran \"recognises its responsibilities towards regional peace and security,\" a statement viewed as relatively conciliatory. Israeli retaliation for an Iranian barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October had been widely expected for weeks.\n\nTehran had said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July. Many missiles were shot down by Israel and its allies but a small number struck central and southern Israel. Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were attacked. The military claimed that the attacks had been successfully countered, although there was \"limited damage\" in some locations. Following the Israeli strikes, Iranian state media carried footage showing traffic flowing normally in several cities, while school and sports activities were reportedly being held as scheduled. The Israeli military announced Saturday's operation shortly after explosions were reported in Iran. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the military had demonstrated its preparedness \"to defend the state of Israel\". He also warned if Iran started a new round of escalation, Israel would be \"obliged to respond\".\n\nThe US and Britain have both urged Iran not to strike back following the latest strikes, with President Joe Biden's administration calling for an end to the cycle of violence. Senior US administration officials said the US was informed of Israel's strikes beforehand, and that Washington had no involvement in them. The attacks did not include Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities - targets the Biden administration had urged Israel not to hit - an official said. The official said the US had encouraged Israel for weeks to conduct a response that was \"targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm\" and suggested that was \"precisely what transpired\" on Saturday evening. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying Israel chose its targets \"in accordance with its national interests, and not according to American dictates\". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself against \"Iranian aggression\" and echoed calls for Iran to avoid retaliation, saying the UK would work to \"de-escalate the situation across the region\". But Russia and other countries in the region, including US allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, accused Israel of escalating the conflict. Qatar expressed \"deep concern about the serious repercussions that may result from this escalation\", while Jordan described the attack as a \"dangerous escalation\". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said \"what is needed is to stop provoking Iran to retaliate, and to get out of the spiral of uncontrollable escalation\". The extent of the Israeli strikes and their precise targets were still unclear on Saturday morning. Iran's aviation authority briefly suspended flights but announced that they would restart from 09:00 local time (06:30 BST). Hooman, a 42-year-old factory employee, was working in Tehran when he heard the blasts, he told news agency AFP. \"It was an echoing sound... terrible and horrifying,\" the agency quoted him as saying. \"Now that there is war in the Middle East, we are afraid that we will be dragged into it.\" Israeli air strikes also targeted sites in central and southern Syria, Syrian state media reported. Following the Israeli strikes, Hezbollah fired 80 projectiles across the border into Israel on Saturday afternoon, according to the IDF. Later, AFP news agency reported the Iran-backed group fired a series of rockets at five residential areas in northern Israel, including the outskirts of Krayot near Haifa.\n\nTehran at sunrise on Saturday morning, following Israeli strikes on sites around the Iranian capital",

    "Russian cash-for-votes flows into Moldova as nation heads to polls\n\nIlan Shor - pictured here while running for election in 2019 - fled the country before being sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement\n\nThe sniffer dogs at Chisinau Airport have been working extra hard in recent months, searching for money that might be evidence of Russian meddling in Moldovan politics. Ami, a black retriever, gives every suitcase that rolls in on the baggage claim belts a good sniff on all sides. If she detects cash, she will freeze. Back in May she was doing that a lot. That is when customs officers began finding large amounts of money on passengers arriving via connecting flights from Moscow. People who had never left Moldova before were returning from a few days in Russia with wads of notes. \u201cAlmost everyone had money: 2,000, 3,000, 7,000 euros\u201d, the head of customs at Chisinau Airport, Ruslan Alexandrov, remembers. The amounts themselves were not illegal but the patterns were suspicious. \u201cThere were certain flights: Moscow-Istanbul-Chisinau, Moscow-Yerevan-Chisinau,\u201d the customs chief explains. \u201cNormally people don\u2019t come in with that much money. Not from Moscow.\u201d\n\nSo police and prosecutors began seizing the cash. In one day alone they say they scooped $1.5m (\u00a31.2m). No-one ever asked for their money back. The authorities believe the cash mules were part of a major and ongoing operation to buy political influence run by a fugitive Moldovan oligarch named Ilan Shor. Convicted of major fraud in Chisinau, he is now resident in Russia which will not extradite him. Ahead of two key votes this weekend, the capital\u2019s airport is on alert. Flights from all \"high risk\" routes are met by sniffer dogs and at least half the passengers are pulled over for extra baggage scans.\n\u2022 None Explained: Decision time for two countries on future role in Europe On Sunday, President Maia Sandu is running for re-election on a staunchly pro-EU platform, challenged by 10 other candidates. Many are openly sympathetic to Moscow; some see Moldova as a \"bridge\". Voters will also get to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether to enshrine Moldova\u2019s goal of EU accession in the constitution. In fact, membership talks have already begun but the country has been in a battle over its political direction for decades, ever since Moldova gained independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union fell apart. That East-West tug has intensified since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Sandu \u2013 a former World Bank economist first elected on a promise to clean up corruption \u2013 then steered Moldova much more sharply towards the West. She began to openly identify Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia as a major security threat. The Kremlin denies playing any role in Chisinau politics, but officials here accuse Russia of operating via proxies to disrupt and destabilise the country.\n\nPresident Maia Sandu (right) is running for re-election\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anywhere else where we\u2019ve seen such a brazen and open attempt to corrupt an election,\u201d Moldova\u2019s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, Veronica Dragalin, told me this week in her office in Chisinau. Born in Moldova, she spent most of her life in the US \u2013 most recently as a prosecutor in Los Angeles \u2013 before returning to the country and a job in a small office on the fifth floor of a Soviet-era block with a broken lift. What her team say they have uncovered, working with police, is a pyramid payments scheme openly run from Russia by Ilan Shor and his group. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a foreign country sending money in an attempt to influence the election,\u201d Ms Dragalin spells it out. She details evidence gained through wiretaps, police infiltrators and witnesses \u2013 some of which her office has made public. \u201cAt the start they tried to make it look legitimate. Now it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re flagrantly flaunting all the laws\u2026 [and] openly influencing the decision to vote,\u201d the prosecutor says. \u201cThe primary goal is to have the referendum fail.\u201d According to her team, once the cash couriers were detected at the airport and that route made more difficult, payments began to be channelled via a sanctioned Russian bank, PSB. By early October as many as 130,000 voters had received payment through this scheme - about 10% of the active electorate, according to Viorel Cernauteanu, the chief of police. \u201cIn September alone, $15m (\u00a312m) was transferred,\u201d he told me, explaining how they could trace funds and recipients because they gave personal data to open a bank account. Offering money or goods in return for votes is a crime with a possible five-year jail sentence. Last month, a new law made it an administrative offence to accept money, too. But in one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries it is not hard to find willing recipients of cash.\n\nMoldovan investigators admit they cannot identify the source of funds paid into PSB bank \u2013 whether it is Russian state money, private capital or the cash Ilan Shor was convicted of stealing in Moldova. But he himself is very open about his actions and aims. In a typical recent post on TikTok, Shor called for a \u201cfirm NO\u201d to the EU. He then urged followers to choose \u201cthe president I decide on, as someone I can work with\u201d. In return he promised monthly top-up payments of 5,000 Moldovan lei to pensioners, or about \u00a3200. Shor fled Moldova in 2019 and was later sentenced in absentia for money laundering and embezzlement. Last year, his party was banned and he is also under Western sanctions, accused of \"malign influence campaigns\" for Russia. Media companies linked to him, Telegram channels and various political groupings have all been blocked. But his message \u2013 anti-EU, sympathetic to Moscow \u2013 still seeps through. Some remain receptive to that, as well as the cash.\n\nDeputy governor of Gagauzia spoke openly of his scorn for the EU\n\nThe deputy governor of Gagauzia, a small autonomous region of southern Moldova, also happens to respect Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tells me that is because he likes strong leaders who he thinks \"put their country first\". Russia\u2019s war on neighbouring Ukraine changed nothing on that score. He admires former US President Donald Trump for the same reason, whilst his scorn for the EU \u2013 which recently placed him under sanctions for \"destabilising activities\" \u2013 mainly focuses on LGBT rights, which he opposes virulently. Later, when I ask passers-by in the regional capital Comrat about the EU referendum, several reply that they\u2019ll vote \"no\" in order to keep \"gay parades\" from their town.\n\nA sign for the pro-Russian Victory party in Comrat, Gagauzia\n\nPro-Russian views and Kremlin-led narratives have always been strong in Gagauzia, where many still watch Russian state TV channels despite a national ban. Lately, Shor has been investing heavily here. The deputy governor repeatedly refers to him as \u201cour political leader\u201d and shrugs off the criminal conviction as if it were political. \u201cTry and say a bad word here about Ilan Shor and people will spit at you!\u201d, Uzun declares as we drive down Lenin Street past a statue of the Russian revolutionary, a little grubby but still intact. Many shop signs, those not in the local Gagauz language, are in Russian. I hear how Shor pays top-up pensions to 30,000 people in the region as well as re-tarmacking some 50 km (31 miles) of roads between remote villages, which we see. \u201cAll he does is for the people,\u201d Uzun enthuses.\n\nThe anti-corruption prosecutor later clarifies that using donations for social spending is not a crime. But channelling Shor\u2019s funds to political parties is an offence \u2013 and Uzun\u2019s boss, regional governor Evghenia Gutul, has been charged with that. After a while we roll up to a children\u2019s fairground. \u201cLook at Gagauziyaland, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Uzun beams, leading the way beneath a giant rainbow into a deserted but brand-new park.\n\nGagauziyaland, a children's playground, was almost deserted during our visit\n\nThe wind is bitterly cold and the mini dragon roller-coaster and merry-go-round we are looking at both stand empty and still. But Uzun insists people in Gagauzia will vote \u201chow Shor tells them\u201d - not for money, but because they trust him. \u201cAll the talk, that he\u2019s an arm of the Kremlin, destabilising Moldova: that\u2019s absolutely not true. This is the truth: what you see here,\u201d he waves towards the frozen fairground.\n\nWomen in traditional Moldovan dress welcomed President Maia Sandu at a campaign event on Friday\n\nOn Friday, Moldova\u2019s election campaign reached its climax. Maia Sandu was met for her own final rally in the small town of Telenesti, where women in traditional dress sang and supporters clapped as she passed. She has not taken part in election debates and did not want to speak to the BBC. But addressing a couple of hundred people through a microphone, Sandu urged Moldovans to vote for her and for the EU as the best path to peace. \u201cThis has been a very difficult campaign with a lot of lies and dirty money,\u201d she told them, asking voters to \u201cput our country out of harm\u2019s way\u201d and prevent her opponents \u201cderailing Moldova from its European path\u201d. That path has been a bumpy one for many years, with multiple diversions. Still, Moldova had already made its choice and opened accession talks with the EU. Now a referendum that Sandu initiated in an attempt to reinforce that goal and bolster her own support has turned into a risky political move. It looks like the presidential ballot is not the only vote she has to worry about on Sunday.",
    "Flies, rats and offers of hush money - the price of living next to a \u2018monster\u2019 incinerator\n\nGeorge and Mandy are among the residents who refused to sign an NDA agreement and can speak about the Runcorn incinerator\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with flies, rats, smell, noise. It's just been horrendous,\u201d says Mandy Royle, who lives in the closest home to the UK\u2019s biggest waste incinerator at Runcorn in Cheshire. The facility generates electricity from burning nearly a million tonnes of household rubbish every year - but much of that waste doesn't come from Ms Royle's local area. Like many incinerators, deliveries come from hundreds of miles away. BBC analysis suggests the burden of the UK's waste is disproportionately falling on deprived areas such as Runcorn, which are 10 times more likely to have an energy-from-waste incinerator in their midst than in the wealthiest areas.\n\nMany families nearby shared a \u00a31m settlement after 180 of them launched a legal action over the pollution and disturbances from the Runcorn incinerator, the BBC can reveal. But Ms Royle was one of a handful of people who did not sign the agreement, allowing her to speak out about life in the shadow of one of the UK's giant waste plants. \u201cI\u2019m just stuck in this little corner with a big monster staring at me and throwing what it does over me,\u201d she says. The others who took the cash, worth about \u00a34,500 per family after legal costs, had to sign a strict non-disclosure agreement (NDA). \u201cWell, I think they\u2019re being unfair in what they're paying, and completely unfair in what they are doing,\u201d says George Parker, who runs a local garage and also refused to sign the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a million-pound hush fund and a gagging order. That's why they're doing it, they\u2019re keeping everybody quiet.\u201d\n\nViridor, which runs the Runcorn plant, said it would not comment on the settlement or on the non-disclosure agreement. It said that noise and odour remained within permitted levels - regulated by the Environment Agency - and any complaints were fully investigated with feedback provided to residents.\n\nEnergy-from-waste incinerators have boomed over the past decade as local councils have faced higher charges to bury rubbish in landfill sites. This shift, though, has come at a big cost to the environment, with a BBC investigation showing that these plants now produce as much carbon per unit of energy than as if they were burning coal. It also comes at a cost to those who live near them, say Ms Royle and Mr Parker. \u201cThey put them in deprived areas, so people won\u2019t complain because they know the majority of the people are in such a state they don\u2019t know how to complain basically,\u201d Mr Parker says.\n\nOur investigation found breaches of air quality controls increased both at Runcorn and across incinerators in England between 2019 and 2023. These controls restrict the levels of gases such as carbon monoxide that can be emitted. The number of these permit breaches has risen from an average of 3.4 in 2019 to 5.5 per incinerator in 2023. Last year 73% of facilities in England reported transgressions. Runcorn\u2019s energy-from-waste site breached its permit 17 times in the past five years. \u201cThe Runcorn Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) operates within a strict Environmental Permit and is heavily regulated by the Environment Agency, meaning it must comply with all the necessary regulations and permit conditions,\u201d Viridor said in a statement. \u201cShould a permit limit be exceeded, a full and thorough investigation into the cause is carried out.\u201d Household waste is also being sent hundreds of miles across the country to be burned, or even sent abroad, BBC analysis of UK council data showed.\n\nResidents who live near the Runcorn incinerator have been psychologically impacted, says food bank manager Eddie Thompson\n\nIn one of the worst examples, waste from Derby City Council and Derbyshire Council ended up at 19 different incinerators in one year - from Milton Keynes to North Yorkshire. The increased movement of waste by train and lorry is producing even more carbon emissions and worsening local air pollution. A spokesperson for Derby City Council and Derbyshire County Council said the councils had signed a new contract which will reduce this number to 13, and that \u201creducing waste miles is a key part of our strategy.\u201d In another case, County Durham sent 1,300 tonnes of waste last year to an undisclosed incinerator facility in Cyprus, even though there are incinerators nearby in north-west England. The council said it was \"standard industry practice to divert waste from landfill through energy-from-waste facilities\".\n\nWhile Runcorn is home to the UK\u2019s biggest incinerator, a significant proportion of the town\u2019s local rubbish is not burned at the site. Instead, some of the waste from the borough of Halton, where Runcorn is located, and from other Merseyside towns, is sent by train about 150 miles across the country to the east coast, to be burned on Teesside. This whole area along the River Tees has emerged as a UK hotspot for energy-from-waste. The region is now home to three active incinerators, with three more in various stages of planning. \u201cWe have become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s rubbish by stealth,\u201d says an independent councillor in Redcar, Dr Tristan Learoyd. He says that incinerators in the area are tied into long-term contracts with councils across the country, which he believes will see large amounts of carbon emitted every year for decades to come. \u201cThere's a potential here for the number of incinerators to be in double figures,\u201d he says. \u201cFor my hometown, which has suffered a massive decline over the years, it's just another kick in the face. We're becoming the rubbish backyard of England.\u201d Linda Martin lives on the nearest street to the Wilton 11 incinerator in Billingham, Teesside, which burns more than 400,000 tonnes of rubbish every year. She questions whether people in the locality are seeing any direct economic benefit from the facility.\n\nDo you ever think about what happens to your rubbish after it\u2019s been taken away? Most of what we chuck in the bin is actually being burnt for energy. The BBC has found there's been a rapid rise in the burning of rubbish across the UK in recent years with major implications for the environment. For the 5 Questions On podcast, science reporter Esme Stallard explains.\n\n\u201cThis is our home and our area. Why should we have to put up with everything that we're putting up with?\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, we hear the noise constantly. We've got double glazing in, but it don't work. You still hear the noise!\u201d For Eddie Thompson MBE, who runs a busy food bank in Runcorn, the psychological impact of locating large-scale incinerators in poor areas is very important. \u201cMentally, people feel as though, in some cases, they are worthless. They have no sense of a future that they can see ahead of them. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Viridor, but are we getting it right?

    "Flood fears as Storm Bert heads into second day\n\nDrivers are being advised to be aware of surface water on the roads\n\nParts of Scotland are bracing for a second day of disruption with high winds and localised flooding after Storm Bert swept heavy snow and rain across the country. The central belt was hit by more snow than anticipated early on Saturday, causing widespread problems on the roads. The M8 saw long traffic jams and two of the main routes south - the M74 and A68 - were closed for a time due to accidents. Regional flood alerts have also been issued for parts of Dumfries and Galloway, west Borders, Central, Tayside, Aberdeenshire, Dundee and Angus regions. A yellow weather warning for wind in the Highlands and Argyll and Bute will come into place from 12:00.\n\nFlood warnings, external urging people to \"act now\" are also in place for four areas including the Churchill Barriers in Orkney, Strath Oykel in Sutherland and at the Carse of Lennoch and Crieff in Tayside.\n\nTraffic was diverted to the Forth Road Bridge from the Queensferry Crossing\n\nIn an unusual move, the Queensferry Crossing across the Firth of Forth was closed due to the threat of falling ice on Saturday. Traffic in the area was diverted via the Forth Road Bridge. The diversion remained in place until 01:00 on Sunday. David Bishop from the national road maintenance body Bear Scotland said the closure was due to concerns that ice sticking to the bridge's 70km of cable stays could fall and cause a \"significant road traffic incident\". It is the first time since 2021 the bridge has closed. All 700 buses in the Lothian Buses fleet ground to a halt for much of Saturday due to tough road conditions. The company announced services were back to normal early on Saturday evening. Edinburgh sightseeing buses were cancelled and there was disruption on Citylink, McGill's and First services. A dramatic image shared on social media showed a bus which had left the road at Buchlyvie, a village in the Stirling area.\n\nThere were accidents across the road network as drivers struggled with the poor conditions\n\nGeorge Henry, head of road safety and road policy for Transport Scotland, said the conditions had been \"challenging\". He said: \"We have been treating our roads around the clock, our operating companies have been out and we have used over 240 gritters. \"Unfortunately there has been some impacts with various vehicles being stuck due to some vehicles losing traction at various location and we\u2019ve tried to treat that as quickly as we can to minimise the disruption to the motoring public.\"\n\nMr Henry said particular incidents had impacted the M8 near Livingston and the M74 at various points on Saturday. He added attention is now turning to the risk of localised flooding caused by the temperature rising and snow melting. \"There will be lots of surface water so we urge the motoring public when they are returning to the roads to please take care and drive to the conditions they are faced with,\" he added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA total of 11 SPFL games were called off with kick-off times delayed on another three, including two in the Premiership. One of those called off was a league two match between Cove Rangers and Stenhousemuir, after the away team's bus got stuck in snow at Broxden Services outside Perth. Over 3,000 homes in England and Wales are without power. Scotland has not been hit as hard, with both Scottish Power and SSE reporting just a few localised faults. The Met Office has warned a rapid thaw and subsequent rain may cause further disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain and snow remained in place for most of Scotland until 09:00 on Sunday. The Highlands and Argyll and Bute will see winds of up to 65mph on Sunday, with a yellow warning in place from 12:00 until 00:00.

    "Tony Chambers, pictured with members of his legal team, did not contact the police for almost a year after first being made aware of concerns about Lucy Letby\n\nThe former chief executive of the hospital where Lucy Letby murdered seven babies said the father of the serial killer \"made threats\" in \"angry meetings\". Tony Chambers was in charge at the Countess of Chester hospital during 2015 and 2016, when the nurse also attempted to murder seven other infants. Mr Chambers told the public inquiry into the circumstances around Letby's offending that he and his fellow board members \"simply didn't see\" what was behind the rising death rate amongst babies on the neonatal unit. He also apologised to the families of Letby's victims \"for the pain that may have been prolonged by any decisions or actions that I took in good faith\".\n\nNicholas de la Poer KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Chambers about meetings he held with Letby and her family in December 2016. This came after managers upheld a grievance she had lodged with the hospital in September that year, about being removed from the neonatal unit and placed onto clerical duties due to accusations against her by senior consultants.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Telling Letby 'we've got your back' was 'clumsy' says ex-hospital boss\n\nThe Thirlwall Inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall heard that during that meeting, Mr Chambers told Letby she would be returning to the unit and accepted saying to her: \"For your resilience Lucy, you astound me.\u201d He said Letby's father, John Letby, wanted to report the consultants who accused his daughter of harming babies to the regulator the General Medical Council (GMC). \"Letby\u2019s father was very angry, he was making threats,\" he said. \"He was making threats that would have made an already difficult situation even worse by threatening GMC referrals for the doctors. \"He was threatening guns to my head.\"\n\nJohn and Susan Letby, the parents of Lucy Letby, demanded action against the doctors who suspected the serial killer of harming babies\n\nMr Chambers said he felt he had \"perhaps\" not handled that meeting well but said he was trying to \"take the heat out\u201d of the situation with Letby\u2019s father. At one meeting, Letby demanded any mention of her being taken off the unit be removed from her personnel file, and said she wanted \"four apologies\" from the consultants who had raised suspicions about her. Mr de la Poer asked: \"Would you agree that this was deeply manipulative behaviour?\" Mr Chambers replied: \"I didn\u2019t feel that I was being manipulated at the time.... \"It was the father who seemed to be pulling the strings rather than Letby herself.\" He accepted he told her \"don't worry Lucy, we've got your back\", which he said in hindsight was \"clumsy language\".\n\nWeekly updates from the public inquiry examining the murders committed by Lucy Letby\n\nHe also told her a review of neonatal mortality by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in September 2016 had \"vindicated\" her. Mr Chambers told the inquiry he accepts the RCPCH review did not vindicate Letby because it had not investigated any link between her and the deaths - although he said it did not indicate anything suspicious. \"I was very conscious to try as much as possible to avoid further escalation particularly from her father\", he said. Mr de la Poer asked: \"If it was an attempt by Lucy Letby to take control and get what she wanted, and go on the offensive, she succeeded in recruiting you to that. Mr Chambers said: \"No I don\u2019t think so at all\", adding that he believed Letby just wanted to \"get back to the job she loved\".\n\nLucy Letby was allowed to work on the unit for one more day after chief executive Tony Chambers first learned of concerns about her\n\nEarlier the inquiry heard that Mr Chambers held a meeting with consultant paediatricians on 29 June 2016, which, he said, was the first time he had been told there were concerns about Letby's links to unexplained deaths and collapses of babies. He told the inquiry the concerns about Letby were \"very shocking\" to hear, but that \"we wouldn't jump to criminality as the causal factor\". Mr Chambers said: \"There was strong rebuttal to the proposition that this one nurse was deliberately causing harm. \"There was a very strong level of support for this individual.\" Letby was due to go on leave for a fortnight after 30 June and afterwards was placed onto clerical duties, never returning to the unit. Mr de la Poer asked about a meeting on 27 March 2017, when consultant Dr Stephen Brearey told Mr Chambers the police should be called in. Mr Chambers said that at that meeting the agreement was made to contact police, but he did not write to the chief constable of Cheshire Constabulary until 2 May, after consulting with criminal barrister Simon Medland QC. However, Mr de la Poer suggested that, in his initial contact with the police, Mr Chambers \"did not present the case at its highest\" and was trying to \"discourage\" an investigation. Mr Chambers responded \"absolutely not\", and said the hospital \"shared with police very openly and candidly what we genuinely believed to be the position as we understood it at the time\".",

    "Alleged spy 'talked about going to Iran for training', court hears\n\nA former British army soldier who is accused of being a spy for Iran and escaping from Wandsworth Prison last year offered to go for training in Iran, a court heard. The jury at his Woolwich Crown Court trial heard the recording of a conversation that the prosecution said was between Daniel Khalife and two Iranian contacts in November 2021. Mr Khalife, now 23, is accused of gathering information for Iran, compiling a list of special forces soldiers, perpetrating a bomb hoax and escaping prison. He denies all the charges.\n\nIn the recording, Mr Khalife apparently discusses with the two men whether he should travel to Iran or to Lebanon. One of the men, who seems to be the more senior, suggests that Lebanon is the better option. Mr Khalife then says: \"I wanted to have some training from you guys, and I think the best training for me is inside of Iran.\" But the man, speaking with a strong Iranian accent, says Lebanon is better: \"Yes, there we can train you and because we have a safe place there - yes.\" \"Your safety and healthiness is much important for us,\" he says. The man adds: \"We don\u2019t want any dangers for you and the planning for Lebanon. If this is better, if this is good we can plan a safe meeting here.\" Mr Khalife says he is about to have a month\u2019s holiday starting in mid-December. His Iranian contact asks: \"This is not sensitive for you travelling to Lebanon?\" Mr Khalife says: \"It is sensitive. I have to plan. I can\u2019t pay with my credit card. So what I have to do is pay in cash. I will use the money that you gave me.\" The prosecution said the recording of the conversation was recovered from Mr Khalife\u2019s own iPad. There is no evidence that Mr Khalife ever travelled to Iran or Lebanon. Earlier, the jury were read transcripts of two conversations Mr Khalife had with MI5 call handlers after he phoned their publicly available phone number. In the first call, he said he had been approached by an Iranian man and that he had started sending them fabricated documents. He said that he had collected a sum of money in \u00a320 notes in a dog poo bag from Mill Hill Park in North London, and said a year later he had collected \u00a31,000 pounds from under a pot in a cemetery in Kensal Green in West London. In the next call, he questions why he has not received a call back.\n\nIn court yesterday, prosecutors said Mr Khalife - whose role in the Royal Corps of Signals gave him access to highly sensitive information - had offered to work as an agent for Iran in messages to Iranian intelligence handlers. The court also heard that he won a cup for Best Junior Soldier in his squadron, and was recommended for promotion to Lance Corporal aged just 20.\n\nThe jury has heard that Mr Khalife was first arrested in January 2022, and charged in January 2023. He is alleged to have escaped from Wandsworth prison eight months later by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery van before being recaptured after three days.",

    "Salmond's body to be brought home on private flight\n\nA private individual is paying for a charter flight to bring Alex Salmond\u2019s body back to Scotland from North Macedonia. The former first minister died suddenly from a heart attack in the Balkan country on Saturday at the age of 69. There had been calls for an RAF flight to repatriate his body, but it is now confirmed a private charter flight - paid for independently - will fly to Aberdeen. A private family funeral will be held for the Alba Party leader, followed by a public memorial event at a later date.\n\nNo timeline for Salmond's repatriation has been publicly announced but the Alba Party said details would be made available in due course.\n\nActing Alba Party leader Kenny MacAskill said Salmond\u2019s family were \u201cgrateful\u201d to the private citizen who had chartered the flight. He said: \u201cIt brings a great deal of comfort to Moira and other members of the family to know that he will soon be home with them. \"The family have asked that their privacy be respected at this time and will be making an announcement in due course about the funeral arrangements and a memorial service to honour the life of Alex Salmond.\" The statement also thanked the North Macedonian government for expediting the process of releasing his body and both the Scottish and UK governments for their \u201cendeavours\u201d to put plans in place. The Scottish government said it had been a \"complex\" process. A spokesperson said: \u201cOver the last few days the Scottish government and UK government have been engaging with Alex Salmond\u2018s family and working closely together in accordance with their wishes, to ensure the swift and dignified repatriation of the former first minister to Scotland. \u201cHaving explored a number of options, the family have now made arrangements for this to take place with the support of a private citizen.\"\n\nThere is a book of condolence at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh\n\nFriends of Salmond, including the Conservative MP David Davis, had been lobbying the UK government to allow the RAF to fly his body to Scotland. Such arrangements are usually reserved for members of the Royal Family. Chris McEleny, general secretary of the Alba Party, had called on the UK government to allow Salmond's body to be flown directly back to Scotland as it would be quicker than using a commercial flight. He told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"For all that he\u2019s done for Scotland, I think it\u2019s the least that we can do for him.\" Salmond had been attending an Academy for Cultural Diplomacy (ACD) event in Ohrid on Saturday when he took unwell.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nACD director Mark Donfried said he had returned to North Macedonia from his home in Germany to help ensure Salmond was repatriated as soon as possible. He told BBC Scotland News: \"I was taught as a I grew up you don't leave any man behind and, here, I definitely feel a responsibility to make sure that everything goes perfectly with the highest level of respect.\" Tributes have been paid to former SNP leader Salmond from across the political spectrum in recent days. During Prime Ministers' Questions, Sir Keir Starmer described him as a \"monumental figure in Scottish and UK politics\". Tory leader Rishi Sunak and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey also paid tribute in the Commons. Scotland football fans held a minute's applause before Tuesday's match against Portugal at Hampden.",
    "Emma and James Richardson say they found themselves \"haemorrhaging money\" after buying a holiday home\n\nWhen James and Emma Richardson bought a \u00a3110,000 caravan at a holiday park in Lincolnshire, they hoped it would benefit their whole family. The couple, from Cleethorpes, used money left to Mrs Richardson by her parents \u2013 who died in 2017 and 2018 \u2013 to put down a \u00a325,000 deposit and entered into a finance agreement to pay for the rest. They wanted to let relatives use the caravan at Tattershall Lakes for free holidays and also rent it out to the public to offset the cost. Mrs Richardson, 43, said: \"I wanted to do something for the family. It was my way of being able to have them gain from me inheriting. \u201cMum and Dad were very hard-working, very loving. Family was everything.\"\n\nThe Richardsons said a Tattershall Lakes salesperson assured them they would make enough income from hiring out their caravan to cover their monthly finance repayments of \u00a31,269. Away Resorts, which runs the park and manages rentals, denies any such promise was made. A spokesperson told the BBC the company was clear with caravan owners that \"there are no guarantees\" about subletting income. The Richardsons said they found themselves \"haemorrhaging money\" after buying their caravan. \u201cWe had months where we were taking \u00a31,200 in rental costs, but we would only receive \u00a3200 of that because of linen charges, [visitor] passes, cleaning fees,\u201d said Mr Richardson, 46. \u201cWe were so far short of what we were sold.\u201d\n\nEmma and James Richardson lost more than \u00a350,000 over two years\n\nThe couple soon decided to cut their losses and offered to sell their caravan back to the park. After this offer was rejected, the Richardsons paid \u00a320,000 and handed over their caravan to get out of their third-party finance agreement. \"We lost, over a period of two years, in excess of \u00a350,000, which has just crippled us,\" Mr Richardson said. \u201cI'm still paying credit cards off now. We've lost that inheritance that our parents worked all their lives for.\u201d Mrs Richardson said losing the money her parents had left was a \u201cbitter pill to swallow\u201d. She added: \u201cIf it was just my money it would be completely different, but because it\u2019s what my parents worked for\u2026 I felt like I\u2019d let them down.\"\n\nSkipsea in East Yorkshire is home to hundreds of holiday caravans\n\nSince a boom in the 1960s, caravan holidays at Britain's seaside resorts and rural beauty spots have been a popular choice among families looking for an affordable getaway. Today there are more than 3,000 parks across the UK. Caravan and camping holidays brought \u00a37.2bn into the economy last year, according to industry figures. The British Holiday and Home Parks Association (BHHPA), the national trade body for the sector, says these sites bring \"vital tourism\" and investment \"to some of the UK\u2019s most economically challenged areas\". The National Caravans Council (NCC), which also represents the industry, said there were \"many thousands of happy holiday caravan owners across the UK\". But the Richardsons are not the only family to feel they have been left out of pocket by the dream of owning a holiday home. Dozens of people have told the BBC they lost significant sums of money \u2013 some of them their life savings, pensions or inheritance \u2013 after buying a static caravan. The founder of a group set up to support caravan owners said it was \"scandalous\" that \"people's lives are being ruined\".\n\nAndrew and Sue Dawson bought a static caravan at a holiday park on the East Yorkshire coast in 2022, they planned to spend their retirement whiling away weekends at the seaside with their daughters and grandchildren. Then they received some devastating news. In February this year, Mr Dawson, 59, was diagnosed with incurable cancer. \"The doctors gave me between six months and \u2013 as they described it \u2013 a few short years,\" he said. \"Obviously we started talking about the future. It completely changed everything.\" The couple, from Leeds, began getting their affairs in order and decided to sell their caravan at Parkdean's Skipsea Sands resort. But they were in for another shock. The three-bedroom caravan with decking, for which they had paid \u00a362,400 in 2022, was worth just \u00a317,000 two years later. \u201cWe were gobsmacked,\u201d said Mr Dawson. \u201cNo one ever told us we\u2019d face that level of depreciation. \"The salesman sold us the dream, but didn't sell us the reality.\"\n\nAndrew and Sue Dawson enjoyed spending time with their granddaughters at Skipsea Sands\n\nParkdean\u2019s website states that \u201cbuying a holiday home isn't considered a financial investment, as holiday homes depreciate in value with age\u201d. But Mr Dawson said a Skipsea Sands salesperson told him caravans \"pretty much hold their value\". Only when the Dawsons came to sell, following the cancer diagnosis, did they realise they could recoup only a fraction of their expenditure. The couple reluctantly agreed to sell their caravan back to the park for \u00a317,000 after negotiating with the sales team. But on the day the Dawsons cleared out their caravan to finalise the sale, Parkdean cut the price they were willing to pay to \u00a316,000.\n\nAndrew Dawson was diagnosed with stage four cancer in February\n\nMr Dawson said his dealings with the park had been \"dreadful\". \"The amount of money we've lost and the way we\u2019ve been treated, in my opinion is very underhanded and lacking in transparency,\" he added. He said he felt there had been \"a complete lack of empathy, really, knowing my condition, knowing why were selling \u2013 that we didn't really have a lot of choice\". \"We feel they let us down very badly.\"\n\nThe Dawsons paid \u00a362,000 for their caravan with additional decking\n\nAfter the BBC contacted Parkdean, a Skipsea Sands manager called Mr Dawson and offered to pay him \u00a31,000 to resolve the dispute. A Parkdean spokesperson said the company was \"aware of and sympathetic to Andrew\u2019s situation\" and had contacted Mr Dawson \"to agree a suitable offer and settle the matter\". But Mr Dawson said it was \"never about the money,\" adding: \"It doesn't change my view on Parkdean and it doesn't change my view on the industry.\"\n\nSally Nicholls, 70, from Sheffield, used her entire pension pot and a small loan to buy a \u00a369,000 static caravan at Tattershall Lakes in 2021. She said she told a salesperson she planned to live off the rental income in her retirement and was given figures indicating what she could expect to make. \u201cAt the time, it looked like a good proposition,\" she added. Ms Nicholls did make a small profit from her caravan in her first year as an owner, but her takings quickly dried up after repeated increases in park charges, which she was forced to pass on to customers. She then found herself in competition with the park itself, which was able to offer more favourable rates, including free access to facilities, to prospective guests. \"That more or less put a complete halt to the bookings coming in,\" Ms Nicholls said.\n\nSally Nicholls sold her house after losing money on a caravan purchase\n\nMs Nicholls decided to sell her caravan but, like the Dawsons, was shocked at how little it was now worth. After Tattershall Lakes declined to buy it back, she ended up selling to an outside trader for \u00a317,500. \u201cIt came as quite a shock to realise that I wasn\u2019t going to get my pension back to live on in old age,\" said Ms Nicholls, who has since sold her house to free up funds for her retirement and moved to a smaller property in Bolsover. \"I had to consider what I was going to live on,\" she added. \"The only option for me was to sell my home.\" Away Resorts said it provided all prospective buyers with \u201ccomprehensive information, including detailed terms and conditions\u201d to ensure they had \u201cfull awareness of the potential risks and rewards\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cWhile subletting a holiday home can be a way for some owners to generate additional income, we make it clear that there are no guarantees in relation to this, as various factors \u2013 including seasonal demand and wider economic conditions \u2013 can influence returns.\u201d\n\nIbraheem Dulmeer, a barrister who specialises in holiday park law, said caravan buyers were not always fully informed about the agreements they were signing. He said it was \"really, really essential\" buyers did \"due diligence\" and got any promises from salespeople in writing. \u201cMany people from the outset are not provided with any legal advice or don\u2019t obtain any legal advice, they simply go through shaking hands, handing over large sums of money,\" Mr Dulmeer added. \"And what seems to happen is that, as a result of that, they aren\u2019t actually afforded the opportunity to review the terms, review the conditions, and see whether it fits for them. And that\u2019s where most of the problems really stem from.\"\n\nThe BHHPA, which represents holiday parks, said it was important consumers \"read the small print\" and \"fully understand the sales contract\" before committing to buying a caravan. A spokesperson for the NCC, the trade organisation for the industry, said holiday caravan ownership was \"a significant purchase decision\" and potential buyers should conduct their own research to \"fully understand what they are buying\". They added: \"We work with our member parks to remind them of their obligations and responsibilities to help consumers understand clearly what they are buying, when and how they can use their holiday caravan or lodge, and that they treat all customers fairly and honestly using simple language and following best practice.\" Caravan owners are protected by consumer rights laws, which are enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and local Trading Standards offices. The CMA, a government regulator, told the BBC it could not comment on specific cases, but said businesses must not mislead their customers and any claims about products \"must be honest and transparent\".\n\nLast year, a petition signed by more than 27,000 people, which called for protections to be strengthened, was rejected by the Conservative government. The petition was started by the Holiday Park Action Group, which has more than 66,000 members in a Facebook group in which caravan buyers voice complaints. Its founder Carole Keeble said consumers were \"consistently misled in respect of the true value of the caravans they are buying\" and claimed the CMA was failing to act. She told the BBC it was a \"national scandal that people are losing their pensions, inheritance or having to sell their own homes to cover the losses they are incurring\". Meanwhile, Ms Nicholls said she wanted a regulator to \"step up and take control\" of the sector. She added: \"It's had a devastating impact on me.

    "Online fraudsters are selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies, the Daily Express reports\n\nThe build-up to next week's budget continues to lead many of the papers. The Daily Telegraph, external says Chancellor Rachel Reeves' plan to change the government's fiscal rules will \"unleash a borrowing spree of up to \u00a350bn\". The Daily Mail s, externalays the figure equates to \u00a31,750 per household. The shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is quoted saying the plan risks pushing up interest rates and \"punishing families with mortgages\". Writing in the Financial Times, external, Reeves says \"guardrails\" will be in place to ensure prudent spending. There's also a warning for Reeves at the prospect of imposing national insurance on employers' pension contributions - a policy that could raise \u00a315bn. In a letter to the Times, external, former work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett describes the potential measure as \"very worrying\" because it could lead to employers reducing pension contributions. That would come at a time when the government's own figures show four in ten private sector workers are not saving enough for an adequate income in retirement. The proposed ban on smoking in pub gardens is, according to the Sun, external, \"running out of puff\" and on the verge of being dropped. The paper says smoking is now only to be prohibited outside schools and hospitals. The Guardian reports, external that there was \"fierce opposition from the hospitality trade\" to the plan. No 10 officials also privately believe banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is an \"unserious policy\" and not backed by good evidence to show non-smokers are harmed. \"Time to listen\", is the message from the Daily Mirror, external on the subject of the UK paying reparations for its role in the slave trade. But the Daily Telegraph's editorial , externalsays there is \"no case\" for Britain to answer - and such demands for cash \"stand on shaky moral ground\". The Daily Mail's, external editorial takes aim at the prime minister's handling of the row. It says \"canny politicians\" from elsewhere in the Commonwealth - who are \"astute at spotting the weakest link\" - appear to have outsmarted him by securing a debate on reparations.\n\nAn investigation by the Daily Express, external has found online fraudsters are ripping off the Royal British Legion's annual appeal by selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies. One website reportedly bragged that its produce was \"suitable for Remembrance Day activities... to honour the lives and memories of fallen soldiers\". The shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, has described the rip off merchants as \"disgraceful\". The Royal British Legion has urged people to only buy poppies from its trusted sellers.

    "The government has ordered a review of physician associates (PA) and anaesthesia associates (AA) in England after mounting concern about their use in the NHS. The number of PAs and AAs, who help doctors, are in the process of being rapidly expanded. But the British Medical Association has voiced concerns they are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and the lines with doctors are getting blurred. Announcing the review, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said there were legitimate concerns that needed looking at but he also criticised the \"toxic nature of the debate\", saying it had left PAs feeling demoralised.\n\nThe review will look at how they are being deployed and what safeguards are needed going forward. Streeting said: \"Many physician associates are providing great care and freeing up doctors to do the things only doctors can do. \"But there are legitimate concerns over transparency for patients, scope of practice, and the substituting of doctors. \"These concerns have been ignored for too long, leading to a toxic debate where physicians feel ignored and PAs feel demoralised.\" He said he hoped the review would \"take the heat out of the issue\" and make sure \"we get the right people, in the right place, doing the right thing\u201d. The review will be led by Prof Gillian Leng, a former chief executive of the NHS drugs advisory body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It will report back early next year to inform the government\u2019s new 10-year plan for the NHS.\n\nThe current NHS workforce plan sees PAs and AAs as a crucial part of the staffing mix in the health service. The numbers have been gradually increasing in recent years, but the plan, published last year, called for a rapid expansion from just over 3,000 to 12,000 by 2036. PAs can work in GP surgeries and hospitals. They are not authorised to prescribe, but they can order some scans, take medical histories and conduct physical examinations. AAs, which support surgery teams, are a much smaller group - there are only about 100 in the NHS. Both PAs and AAs have to complete a two-year master\u2019s degree. They usually need a bioscience-related first degree, but that is not a prerequisite. British Medical Association leader Dr Phil Banfield called for the rollout of new PAs to be paused while the review takes place. And he added: \"The NHS must tell us how they are going to keep patients safe while this review is carried out. \u201cYou do not fly a plane under safety review, you ground it.\" Last week the BBC reported on the death of 77-year-old Susan Pollitt who died in 2023 at Royal Oldham Hospital after a drain was mistakenly left in her abdomen for too long. The inquest into her death concluded it had been caused by an \"unnecessary medical procedure contributed to by neglect\". She received treatment from a PA alongside other staff. Following Mrs Pollitt\u2019s inquest, North Manchester coroner Joanne Kearsley warned about the use of PAs. She said there was a lack of regulation and national framework covering training, supervision and competency, and limited understanding and awareness about the role among both patients and other NHS staff. She also said the lack of a distinct uniform and the title \"physician\" was giving rise to confusion as to whether the practitioner is a doctor.\n\nThe issue of regulation should be addressed next month when the General Medical Council starts regulating PAs and AAs. In September, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which has been broadly supportive of the expansion of the role, accepted a review was needed given the concerns being expressed. But the academy was critical of the \"increasingly acrimonious and destructive debate\" which it said had been fuelled by unsubstantiated comments on social media and was damaging teamwork across the health service. Stephen Nash, head of United Medical Associate Professionals, which represents PAs, said the review would be a chance to \"shine a real light\" on what is going on and provided much needed evidence in a \"very one-sided debate\". Louise Ansari, head of patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said she welcomed the review too. She said patients had reported \"very positive\" interactions with PAs, but she had particular concerns about the fact patients were not always told or made aware they were being seen by a PA.\n\nAre you a PA, AA or a doctor who has been affected?

    "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk. Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said. Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.\n\nThere are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand. Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended. \"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\". Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\". The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\". It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high. However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year. Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024. For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can. But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.\n\nStellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it. Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary. Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection. Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans. Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation. It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton. But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\". \u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said. Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932. At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued. Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.\n\nFactory workers in the engine production line at the Vauxhall car plant in Luton in 1954\n\nNissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\". Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs. The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable. Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\". The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\". The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\".\n\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?",

    "Workers could get right to strike for a year\n\nThe government is considering giving workers twice as long to strike. Under existing legislation, if workers vote to take industrial action, the mandate expires after six months and unions are required to hold another ballot to extend it. But a consultation document produced by the government said the mandate could be extended to a year. It said due to unions being \"very likely'' win a second ballot, keeping the six-month rule would ''add administrative costs'' to them.\n\nRailway staff, train drivers, doctors and teachers are just some of the groups that have staged walk outs in recent times. The walk outs across different sectors and industries over the past couple of years have resulted in more than 5.7 million working days have been lost, the highest number for more than 30 years, according to official figures. Ministers argue that by making it easier for unions to organise, it would lead to a more co-operative relationship with employers and lessen the need for industrial action. The government is proposing to also abolish the requirement that 50% of a workforce turns out to vote. It is looking to get rid of the rule that for \"important public services\" such as the NHS, some 40% of the workforce must have voted in favour of industrial action for it to go ahead. The BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment over the proposals. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, said the government's policies under the Employment Rights Bill were aimed at \"repealing the anti-worker, anti-union laws, and turning the page on industrial relations\". The Employment Rights Bill is a major shake-up of workers' rights, but the reforms proposed are still being worked out and it is still unclear how some will work in practice. Conservative Shadow Business Secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, has urged the government to withdraw the Employment Rights Bill and \"think again\". He said the proposed legislation created \"existential crisis of a magnitude not seen since the pandemic\" for jobs and business people. The government's own analysis released earlier this week said Labour's plans to upgrade workers' rights would cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year to implement.\n\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the union welcomed the government's \"commitment to introduce a modern framework for industrial relations\". Under the bill, the government plans to make to easier for unions to be recognised by employers and companies. A main function of a union is to represent workers in negotiations with their employers over pay and working conditions. At present, 10% of a workforce must be union members for an application to be made to get recognition, but it has been proposed this could be lowered to 2%. Under existing rules, 40% of a workforce must vote in favour of recognition, but under the government's new proposals, that threshold would be abolished. Trade unions have argued that it is too easy for companies to employ extra employees to make it harder for them to reach the required thresholds to be recognised. In July, the GMB trade union lost a vote for recognition at the Amazon Fulfilment Centre in Coventry by 28 votes. The union accused the company of packing out the warehouse with surplus workers in an effort to thwart their bid for recognition. Amazon denied doing so and said it recruited the workers as part of normal business planning.",
    "What happens to Trump\u2019s convictions and legal cases after election win?\n\nTrump is the first person with a felony conviction to serve as president\n\nDonald Trump will be the first president to take office while several criminal cases against him are pending. His ascent to the highest office in the US while facing dozens of criminal charges has left the country in uncharted territory. Many of his legal problems will go away when he steps into the White House. Discussions already have started between Trump's team and the office overseeing federal cases about how to wind those down, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Here's a look at what could happen with each of the four legal challenges he faces.\n\nDonald Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May in New York. A jury of New Yorkers found him guilty of all counts in connection with a hush-money payment made to an adult film star. Judge Juan Merchan pushed back Trump's sentencing from September to 26 November, after the election. He could still go forward with the sentencing as planned despite Trump's win, said former Brooklyn prosecutor Julie Rendelman. But legal experts said it is unlikely that Trump would be sentenced to prison as an older, first-time offender. If he was, his lawyers would appeal the sentence immediately, arguing that jail time would prevent him from conducting official duties and that he should remain free pending the appeal, Ms Rendelman said. \"The appellate process in that scenario could go on for years,\" she said.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith filed criminal charges against Trump last year over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The case has been in legal limbo since the Supreme Court ruled this summer that Trump was partially immune from criminal prosecution over official acts committed while in office. Smith has since refiled his case, arguing Trump's attempts to overturn the election were not related to his official duties. This is one of the cases which could be wound down under current discussions.\n\nAs president-elect, Trump's criminal problems from the case now \"go away\", according to former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. \"It's well established that a sitting president can't be prosecuted, so the election fraud case in DC District Court will be dismissed,\" he said. Mr Rahmani said that if Smith refuses to dismiss the case, Trump can simply get rid of him, as he has pledged to do already. \"I would fire him within two seconds,\" Trump said during a radio interview in October.\n\nSmith also is leading a case against Trump over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House, charges Trump denies. He is accused of storing sensitive documents in his Mar-a-Lago home and obstructing Justice Department efforts to retrieve the files. The judge assigned to the case, Trump-appointee Aileen Cannon, dismissed the charges in July, arguing Smith was improperly appointed by the Justice Department to lead the case. Smith appealed the ruling, but with Trump set to take office, talks are now underway about ending the case. Mr Rahmani said he expects the classified documents case will meet the same fate as the election case. \"The DOJ will abandon its Eleventh Circuit appeal of the dismissal of the classified documents case,\" he said.\n\nTrump is also facing criminal charges in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state. That case has faced a number of hurdles, including efforts to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis over her relationship with a lawyer she hired to work on the case. An appeals court is in the process of weighing whether Willis should be allowed to stay on the case. But now that Trump is the next president, the case could face even more delays, or possibly dismissal. It is expected to be paused during Trump's time in office, according to legal experts. Trump's lawyer Steve Sadow said as much when asked by the judge if Trump could still stand trial if elected. \"The answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\" he said.\n\nIn theory, yes. A president has never pardoned himself before, so the move would be unprecedented. But presidential pardons only apply to federal cases. Trump has only been convicted of 34 state felony charges, so he would not be able to pardon himself in the New York hush-money case.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

She then rang the Department for Infrastructure's (DfI) flood incident helpline to ask for sandbags. \"I made them aware of the situation in the street, the water was coming up the manholes,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\nSarah Kirkwood says she was talking to her neighbours from their upstairs windows while they were stuck inside their houses\n\nMs Kirkwood explained that the area was prone to flooding, but the water had never entered her home before. \"It comes about halfway up the street every year and they've been doing works... so we thought it was all in hand,\" she added. After leaving to get sandbags, Ms Kirkwood arrived back to find her property had flooded, which left her frustrated. Despite the turn of events, Ms Kirkwood said she is \"fortunate\" to have family she can stay with while the damage in her home is dealt with.

The earlier heavy rain combined with snow melt has led to flooding in many areas as rivers burst their banks. Flooding will continue to be a hazard as snow melt feeds down into the river network. According to the Met Office: \"Strong south-westerly winds are expected to develop during Sunday morning across Northern Ireland. \"Gusts of 45-55 mph are expected widely with gusts of up 65 mph possible over hills and exposed locations around the coast.\" The top wind gusts will be similar to those of Saturday and therefore could cause some further damage and disruption.",
    "Met faces service cuts without more cash, says chief\n\nThe boss of the UK's largest police force has warned it faces \"eye-watering cuts\" to services unless ministers increase its funding. Met commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told the BBC he was \"deeply troubled\" by talks so far on its annual settlement for next year. He added that the force was in a \"precarious position\" because previously used options to \"prop up\" its budget were no longer available. The government has said it plans to increase the overall policing budget next year - although allocations by force are still to be negotiated.\n\nThe Met's budget for this year is just over \u00a33.5bn, a 3.5% increase from 2023/24, comprising \u00a32.6bn from central government and \u00a3956m from local taxes. Sir Mark said conversations over its funding allocation from next April - which would normally be expected to be announced in December or January - were still \"ongoing\" with the government and City Hall. But, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, he said he was \"deeply troubled by the situation we appear to be heading towards\". Policing a global capital such as London came with an \"extra set of challenges\", he said, adding that spending per person was lower than in other cities such as New York and Sydney. He said that the \"cumulative effect of decisions over the last decade or so\" had put the force in a \"more and more precarious position\", and some of its buildings would be \"unusable\" in a few years without further investment. \u201cSome of the things that successive [police] commissioners and mayors have used to balance the books - like selling police stations and using reserves - all of those things have run out,\" he added. \u201cThe chancellor has been very clear - it's a difficult public sector context.\"\n\n\"You add all those things together, and you get a dramatic change in budgets of a scale that's never going to be absorbed by efficiencies, and is going to require some pretty eye-watering cuts to the services we provide to London.\" He added that he was not going to get into detail at this stage on the \"tough choices\" the force would face without an increase in resources. But he said he planned to specify \"10 or 20 things we're going to do differently\" before Christmas. He added that the implications for policing in the capital would \"become more public\" in the coming weeks. The budget for the Home Office is set to shrink by 3.3% next year in real terms, with the bulk of this coming from assumed savings on asylum support. At last month's Budget, the government said it planned to \"increase the core government grant for police forces,\" although it did not specify whether this would be in cash terms or taking account of inflation.

    "UK will not pay out over slavery, says Reeves\n\nRachel Reeves echoed comments by the prime minister, saying that there needed to be a focus on the present and not the past\n\nThe UK is \"not going to be paying out\" reparations for the transatlantic slave trade, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC. Her comments come as diplomatic sources told the BBC that the Commonwealth heads of government are preparing to begin a \"meaningful conversation\" about an issue which could potentially mean the UK owing billions of pounds. The chancellor said she understood why Commonwealth leaders would be making such demands, but it was not something the UK government would commit to. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is attending the summit, said he wanted to discuss current challenges, especially climate change, rather than issues of the past.\n\n\"That's where I'm going to put my focus - rather than what will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations,\" he said. \u201cOf course slavery is abhorrent to everybody; the trade and the practice, there's no question about that. But I think from my point of view\u2026 I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work... on the current future-facing challenges.\u201d\n\u2022 None No UK apology over slavery at Commonwealth summit\n\nThe chancellor reiterated that message in an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We\u2019re not going to be paying out the reparations that some countries are speaking about. \"I understand why they make those demands but that\u2019s not something that this government is doing.\" Commonwealth leaders at the Samoa summit are expected to defy the UK and debate ways of securing reparations for historical slavery. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation. Downing Street insists the issue is not on the agenda for the summit of 56 Commonwealth countries. King Charles is in Samoa for a four-day visit and is due to formally open the summit later with a speech paying tribute to his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the role the Commonwealth played in her life. The King will say how \"all nations are equal in this unique and voluntary association\" which \"is committed to developing free and democratic societies\", and will also speak of the \"existential threat\" of climate change and its impact on Commonwealth nations. He will say that the Commonwealth, thanks to its scale and diversity - representing a third of humanity - can \"discuss the most challenging issues with openness and respect\", and also speak to the importance of recognising and understanding the path of history, and where that may have given rise to contemporary challenges.\n\u2022 None What form could reparations for slavery take?\n\nIn the run-up to this year's summit, there have been growing calls from Commonwealth leaders for the UK to apologise and make reparations worth for the country\u2019s historic role in the slave trade. A report published last year by the University of West Indies - backed by Patrick Robinson, a judge who sits on the International Court of Justice - concluded the UK owed more than \u00a318tn in reparations for its role in slavery in 14 Caribbean countries. Frederick Mitchell, foreign minister of the Bahamas, believes the UK could change its stance and he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \u201cOnce you broach the subject it may take a while for people to come around but come around they will.\" Reparatory justice for slavery can come in many forms, including financial reparations, debt relief, an official apology, educational programmes, building museums, economic support, and public health assistance. On a visit to Kenya last year, the King expressed the \"greatest sorrow and regret\" over the \"wrongdoings\" of the colonial era, but stopped short of issuing an apology, which would have required the agreement of ministers.\n\u2022 None King and Queen arrive in Samoa to red carpet welcome\n\nMr Mitchell told the Commonwealth gathering: \"It\u2019s a simple matter \u2013 it can be done, one sentence, one line.\" He said to the BBC: \"The word is apologise, that\u2019s the word.\" Asked how much reparations should amount to, he said it was not just a matter of money but of \u201crespect, acknowledging the past was a wrong that needs to be corrected\u201d. He said member countries \"want the conversation to start\" but \"there appears to be even a reluctance to have the conversation\". Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said: \u201cReparations are not on the agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. The government\u2019s position has not changed \u2013 we do not pay reparations. \"We are focused on using the summit at [the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] to discuss the shared opportunities which we can unlock across the Commonwealth \u2013 including securing more economic growth.\u201d It is understood the Downing Street position \u2013 that reparatory justice is not on the agenda \u2013 while technically correct, has angered some Caribbean ministers when it was obvious the issue would be discussed at the summit.\n\nSome non-Caribbean countries are not unsympathetic towards the British position and want the summit to focus more on existing challenges - such as climate change, which is adversely affecting many Commonwealth countries, about half of whom are small island states. But all three candidates hoping to be elected this weekend as the next secretary general of the Commonwealth - Shirley Botchwey of Ghana, Joshua Setipa of Lesotho and Mamadou Tangara of Gambia - have made clear they support reparatory justice.\n\u2022 None What form could reparations for slavery take?",
    "Billions at stake in court battle over North Sea oil\n\nProtesters from Greenpeace and Uplift gathered outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh at the start of the case\n\nHow much oil - and how much profit - remain beneath the waters that buffet the British Isles? Going by the number of lawyers packed into the Court of Session in Edinburgh this week, it must be a decent amount. Seven advocates squeezed into the front row of courtroom number one where environmental campaigners are challenging the government's approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields. Behind them, a further three rows were also packed with lawyers, tapping on laptops and scribbling in notebooks. Such an army obviously does not come cheap. Remarkably they all agree on one basic fact - the Rosebank oil field in the Atlantic and the Jackdaw gas development in the North Sea were approved unlawfully. However, the lawyers disagree sharply about what, if anything, should be done about it.\n\nThe person who must decide is Andrew Stewart, better known by his judicial title, Lord Ericht, who is presiding over this judicial review of the UK government's decisions to approve the fields. The previous Conservative administration and the oil and gas regulator consented to Jackdaw in summer 2022, with its owner Shell saying the field would be able to provide gas to 1.4 million British homes.\n\nRosebank, located west of Shetland and estimated to contain between 300 and 500 million barrels of oil, was given the green light the following autumn. Operated by Norwegian state energy giant Equinor and Aberdeen-based Ithaca Energy, it is believed to be the largest untapped field in UK waters and its oil is to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland. Among many other requirements, consent was granted on the basis of environmental impact statements submitted by the companies. As was standard practice at the time, these assessed the climate impact of emissions caused by the process of extracting oil and gas but did not assess the impact of the greenhouse gases which would be released when the fossil fuels were eventually burned, known as downstream emissions. Consent in hand, the owners of the fields raced ahead with work to get ready for drilling, striking deals with suppliers and hiring staff. All week the court has heard repeated references to the vast sums of money that are being spent on the two projects.\n\nEquinor says it will invest \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank and provide employment for 4,000 people\n\nCounsel for Equinor said it was investing \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank, providing employment for 4,000 people. Shell's lawyer said it was investing \u00a31.1bn in the Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea, employing \"at least 1,000\" people between 2023 and 2025. Production is scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27. But this June a victory for climate campaigners in the UK Supreme Court sent a shiver through all three firms and the wider industry. In Finch v Surrey County Council, which involved a dispute about drilling oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the court ruled that an environmental impact assessment must include downstream emissions.\n\nOn the eve of the judicial review, Sarah Finch, the environmental campaigner after whom the Surrey case is named, told me that \"the exact same thing happened at Rosebank.\u201d \u201cIt was granted permission with no assessment of the impact of burning the oil or gas to come out of it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo, a much bigger site, but exactly the same argument.\" The three companies involved in the Court of Session accept the Finch ruling means that, in retrospect, their licences were granted unlawfully. However, they insist they provided all the environmental information required at the time of their applications; they were told by the industry regulator not to assess downstream emissions; and they should not be \"punished\" for a Supreme Court decision which they say they could not have foreseen. Lord Ericht appeared to sum up their position succinctly on Friday, when he suggested it amounted to them asking him to say: \"I accept this decision is unlawful but I give it lawful effect.\" The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift strongly object to any such idea. They disagree that the decision in Finch could not have been predicted with one lawyer suggesting the oil companies had simply lost a bet.\n\nBoth groups now want the judge to pause work on Rosebank and Jackdaw while the fields' downstream emissions are assessed. Then, they argue, the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, and the government's North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), could make a fresh decision about the fields\u2019 licences, armed with a fuller understanding of their contribution to climate change. Even then, there may be a snag. Lawyers for the government, who were also in court, say that in certain circumstances they have doubts that Mr Miliband would have the necessary legal power to revisit the decisions at all. If Mr Miliband does have the power, and if it does come to the crunch, it is not clear what he would do. In court, the UK government's lawyer was reluctant to be drawn on the matter. At times he sounded as if ministers very much wished the whole affair would simply go away. After all, in campaigning against the Tories in the general election this summer, Labour had carefully crafted a policy which appeared designed to minimise controversy, and to avoid becoming dragged into the debate about Rosebank. It went like this - Labour was committed to tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also recognised the importance of the oil and gas industry. As such it would not grant any new exploration licences in UK waters but it would allow existing projects - including Rosebank and Jackdaw - to continue. Ministers spoke of domestic energy production as critical for keeping bills down; helping to ensure the nation's energy security; generating taxes; and for assisting with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Many of those claims are contested by environmentalists.\n\nCampaigners hope Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will be able to make a fresh decision on licensing, but he may not have the legal authority to do so\n\nTessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said 80% of the UK's oil was exported. \"There's no world in which you could have a robust environmental assessment that takes into account those downstream emissions and decide that those environmental impacts are acceptable,\" she told me. In Aberdeen though, the heart of the UK's energy industry, there is a great deal of nervousness about the potential impact of the decision in this case, and about the wider impact of government policy on the sector. Just last week, one US oil firm said it would end all North Sea operations by the end of 2029 because of high levels of taxation.\n\nNow, the eyes of climate campaigners, politicians, and oil companies alike are on Lord Ericht. Perhaps he will find a compromise, for example by allowing the oil firms to proceed with preparatory works - as long as they don\u2019t extract any oil and gas - while at the same time requiring them to provide the government with information on downstream emissions to enable them to revisit the decision. The companies\u2019 lawyers bridled at the suggestion that they were in the business of gambling but, in such a case, maybe they would have little choice but to bet that the politics of pulling the plug would be too painful for Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government. Late on Friday afternoon, the judge retired to consider his decision, a process which could take several weeks or even months. Thanking the many lawyers for their \"excellent contributions,\" he concluded the hearing by saying: \"It's a very difficult matter and it's a very important matter,\" adding, \"I shall issue my judgment in due course.\"",
    "Police in Laos have detained eight members of staff at a backpacker hostel following the deaths of six tourists from suspected methanol poisoning last week. According to local media, those detained include workers and management from the Nana Backpacker Hostel in the town of Vang Vieng, where several of the tourists who later died had stayed. It is unclear how many other people were taken ill and an investigation into the deaths is continuing. The owners of the hostel, which is now closed, have previously denied serving illicit alcohol.\n\nIt is not the first time that police have detained staff from the hostel. The manager was among a number of people who were questioned by police last week. He earlier told the Associated Press, external news agency that 19-year-old Australians Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles were the only people staying at the hostel to have become unwell after drinking free shots before heading out for the night. The pair died days later - after being admitted to hospital in neighbouring Thailand. Theirs were the first deaths suspected to be caused by methanol - a toxic, flavourless and colourless substance commonly added to bootleg alcohol. Two Danish women and a 57-year-old American man, who were also staying at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, died at around the same time. The two young Danes - Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, and Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21 - were found unconscious in their hostel bedroom on 13 November. That was the same day that the Australian women were taken to hospital after going out to a bar in the city the night before, local media reported. They were sent to a hospital in the capital Vientiane, but died in the middle of the night. The medical team said the cause of death was sudden heart failure. Also on 13 November, hostel staff noticed that the American tourist - named as James Louis Hutson - had not come out of his room. When they went to check on him, he was found lying dead on the bed, with several empty drinks glasses nearby. There were no bruises or wounds on his body, local media reported.\n\nSimone White, a 28-year-old London lawyer, also died after she was believed to have ingested methanol while staying in Vang Vieng.\n\u2022 None What is methanol and how does it affect the body? The tourists' deaths have cast a spotlight on the popular backpacking town and spooked tourists, especially women, as five of the six who died were female travellers. Governments including New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, have warned their citizens about drinking spirits in Laos. Some travellers in Vang Vieng are steering clear of the once-popular free shots and alcohol buckets offered to tourists, telling the BBC that they felt concerned about their safety. Methanol poisoning is the most prevalent in Asia, mostly affecting poorer communities and places with weak food regulations and enforcement. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on Tuesday that another Australian, a dual national, may also have become ill from methanol poisoning. A New Zealander who had fallen ill from suspected methanol poisoning in the country has now returned home, authorities have confirmed.",

    "UK reveals father and son at heart of Evil Corp hackers\n\nMaksim Yabubets, his father Viktor and brother Artem are accused of running Evil Corp\n\nThe UK, US and Australia have announced sanctions against 16 people authorities accuse of being part of the most wanted cyber crime gang in the world. Russia-based Evil Corp is accused of stealing around $300m in nearly ten years of hacking. The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) says it can now reveal the gang\u2019s notorious leader, Maksim Yakubets, has been supported by his father Viktor Yakubets - something he had denied when interviewed by the BBC in 2021. The information has been released as part of a large, multinational operation to disrupt Evil Corp and another notorious hacking group called LockBit. Known for their mafia-style of operation, Evil Corp has waged a campaign of destructive cyber-attacks worldwide for over a decade. In 2019, Maksim Yakubets was sanctioned and a $5m bounty was put up for his arrest, along with another man called Igor Turashev. Other Russian individuals, including Yakubets' brother Artem, were also named as part of the US sanctions and designations. In 2021 the BBC travelled to Russia to search for and interview members of the gang to get their side of the story. At a former home of Maksim Yakubets we found his father, who gave an impassioned defence of his son while claiming he was personally innocent. But now the NCA says that Yakubets senior was a major part of the cyber-crime group, accusing him of aiding the gang in laundering some of its stolen funds.\n\nMaksim Yakubets lived what's been described as a playboy lifestyle in Moscow\n\nAs well as the Yakubets family members, Maksim's father-in-law was also sanctioned for helping to protect and coordinate the group with his connections to the Russian security services. Western authorities have now officially linked Eduard Benderskiy, a former high-ranking FSB official, to Evil Corp. \"Maksim Yakubets and his Evil Corp gang has for years lived the archetypal Russian hacker playboy lifestyle seemingly untouchable to law enforcement but today\u2019s announcement shows that we are still watching, digging and determined to disrupt them and bring them to justice,\" said Will Lyne, Head of Cyber Intelligence at the NCA.\n\nAnother of those sanctioned is Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, described by the NCA as the younger Yakubets\u2019 right-hand man, and an affiliate of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit. It's the first time that a member of Evil Corp has been linked to another major gang and indicates that hackers are working across groups to carry out attacks. As well as the sanctions, four arrests were made, including two in the UK. In August, the NCA executed a number of search warrants in the south of England and arrested a 46-year-old male who is suspected of being linked to a LockBit affiliate. A 50-year-old female was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences. They too were interviewed and later released under investigation whilst the criminal investigation continues. Both individuals were identified through the analysis and enrichment of data acquired during the course of Operation Cronos - the international police operation that brought down LockBit's internal infrastructure. \u201cThe action announced today has taken place in conjunction with extensive and complex investigations by the NCA into two of the most harmful cybercrime groups of all time,\" said James Babbage, Director General for Threats at the NCA. The NCA said Evil Corp's links to the Russian links to the Russian state had been exposed. \"Today's sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem,\" said foreign secretary David Lammy.",

    "Maori haka in NZ parliament to protest at bill to reinterpret founding treaty\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNew Zealand's parliament was brought to a temporary halt by MPs performing a haka, amid anger over a controversial bill seeking to reinterpret the country's founding treaty with M\u0101ori people. Opposition party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional ceremonial group dance after being asked whether her party supported the bill, which faced its first vote on Thursday. Meanwhile, a h\u012bkoi - or peaceful protest march - organised by a M\u0101ori rights group, is continuing to make its way towards the capital, Wellington. Thousands have already joined the nine-day march against the bill, which reached Auckland on Wednesday, having begun in the far north of New Zealand on Monday.\n\nThe country is often considered a leader in indigenous rights, but opponents of the bill fear those same rights are being put at risk by this bill. Act, the political party that introduced the bill, argues there is a need to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which has been fundamental to race relations in New Zealand. The core values of the treaty have, over time, been woven into New Zealand's laws in an effort to redress the wrong done to M\u0101ori during colonisation.\n\nThe protest march against the bill made its way through Auckland on Wednesday\n\nBut Act - a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition - say this has resulted in the country being divided by race, and the bill will allow the treaty to be interpreted more fairly through parliament, rather than the courts. The party's leader, David Seymour, has dismissed opponents as wanting to \"stir up\" fear and division. Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling of much-needed support for many M\u0101ori. The first reading passed on Thursday after a 30-minute break, backed by all parties from the ruling coalition. Maipi-Clarke was suspended from the house. It is unlikely to pass a second reading, as Act's coalition partners have indicated they will not support it. But this has not placated those worried about the bill, and its impact, with the hikoi still making progress along its 1,000km (621-mile) route.\n\nDanielle Moreau (centre) took part in the march as it passed through Auckland with her sons Bobby and Teddy\n\nIn Auckland, it took an estimated 5,000 marchers two hours to cross the harbour bridge. Officials had closed two lanes, the New Zealand Herald reported, external, to allow them to continue along the route. Danielle Moreau, who is M\u0101ori, walked over the Harbour Bridge with her two sons, Bobby and Teddy, and told the BBC she \"was hoping it [the h\u012bkoi] would be big but it was much more epic than I expected\". \"I marched to make the point that Te Tiriti [the Treaty of Waitangi] is very important to our national identity,\" said Winston Pond, who also took part in the march on Wednesday. \"We are a multi-cultural society built on a bicultural base - something that cannot be altered.\"\n\nJuliet Tainui-Hernandez (left), with her partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez (right) and daughter Paloma (centre)\n\nJuliet Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez, from the M\u0101ori tribe Ng\u0101i Tahu, and her Puerto Rican partner Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, brought their daughter Paloma to the h\u012bkoi. Ms Tainui-Hern\u00e1ndez said those who turned out in support did so \"for the respectful and inclusive nation we want Aotearoa [New Zealand] to be for our tamariki mokopuna - our children and grandchildren\". Kiriana O\u2019Connell, who is also M\u0101ori, said that the current treaty principles were already a compromise for her people, and she would not support a \"rewrite\". Under the proposed legislation, the treaty principles that would be defined in law are:\n\u2022 None that the government has a right to govern and that parliament has the full right to make laws\n\u2022 None that the rights of M\u0101ori are respected by the Crown\n\u2022 None that everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to equal protection under it. Act leader Seymour - who is also New Zealand's associate justice minister - argues that because the principles have never been properly defined legally, the courts \"have been able to develop principles that have been used to justify actions that are contrary to the principle of equal rights\". He says these include \"ethnic quotas in public institutions\" that go against the spirit of fairness for all New Zealanders. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, however, has called the bill \"divisive\" - despite being part of the same coalition.\n\nAct Party leader David Seymour will become deputy prime minister next year under a role-sharing agreement\n\nMeanwhile, the Waitangi Tribunal, which was set up in 1975 to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, notes the bill \"purposefully excluded any consultation with M\u0101ori, breaching the principle of partnership, the Crown\u2019s good-faith obligations, and the Crown\u2019s duty to actively protect M\u0101ori rights and interests\". It also said that the principles of the bill misinterpreted the Treaty of Waitangi and that this \"caused significant prejudice to M\u0101ori\". The tabling of the Treaty Principles Bill comes following a series of measures introduced by the government that have affected M\u0101ori. They include the closure of the M\u0101ori Health Authority, which was set up under Jacinda Ardern's Labour government to help create health equity, and reprioritising English over M\u0101ori when it comes to the official naming of government organisations, for example. While roughly 18% of New Zealand's population consider themselves to be M\u0101ori, according to the most recent census, many remain disadvantaged compared with the general population when assessed through markers such as health outcomes, household income, education levels and incarceration and mortality rates. There remains a seven-year gap in life expectancy. The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement between the British and many, but not all, M\u0101ori tribes, which was signed in 1840. It is contentious as it was written in both English and M\u0101ori - which had only been a spoken language until colonisation - and the two versions contain fundamental differences when it comes to issues such as sovereignty. While the treaty itself is not enshrined in law, its principles have been adopted over time into various pieces of legislation. The bill will now be sent to a select committee for a six-month public hearing process.",
    "The sprint finish to the start line is on. It is not the sprint finish to the finish line, but the sprint finish to the starting blocks. The next leader of the Conservative Party will be selected by Conservative Party members, but they will only get to choose from the final two candidates picked by Conservative MPs on Wednesday afternoon. Right now, there is: Intrigue, plotting, phone calls, quiet chats, guesswork and claims of underhand tactics. \u201cWe are pushing towards quite the season finale,\u201d one Conservative MP said to me. I know what you might be thinking: pull yourself together, this is a vote to determine the final two candidates to become the Leader of the Opposition next month. It is not exactly the race to the White House. But it is, nonetheless, a crunch moment.\n\nThere are three candidates left - James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch - but just two golden tickets. You can read more about the three still in the running here. The standout development in Tuesday\u2019s round of voting was James Cleverly propelling himself not just into the lead, but being miles in front. He managed 39 votes, a number even some in his own camp acknowledge was a bit higher than they were expecting. His performance is put down to making the most of his conference speech last week and the efficient hoovering up of quite a lot of MPs who had previously backed the former cabinet minister Mel Stride. In a race with 121 votes available in total, if every Conservative MP votes, 41 is sufficient to guarantee a place in the final two, since both rivals cannot outpoll you. (Incidentally, I am told that outgoing leader Rishi Sunak did not vote, meaning there was actually an electorate of 120).\n\nEither way, Cleverly is very nearly there, assuming he does not go backwards. The working assumption of all of the campaigns is that he is going to make the final pair. And so it is now a tussle between Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick for second place. Jenrick came second in this latest round of voting, with 31 votes \u2013 but managed to lose two votes from the previous round. Badenoch came third with 30, just one vote behind, but did gain two votes. And there are now 20 votes looking for a new home after the widely expected elimination of the former security minister Tom Tugendhat. It may not seem like a big number, but 20 is one heck of a lot in an electorate of 121. \u201cJames is an irrelevance now. It\u2019s all now a battle between us and Kemi\u2019s team,\u201d said a Team Jenrick insider. \u201cTom\u2019s supporters are closer to our side than hers,\u201d they added. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ahead in the end.\u201d It is a characteristic blast of confidence from Jenrick\u2019s camp, who have exuded plenty of it throughout. But there is no shortage of psychology in all of this too - and you might need a splash of outward confidence when you have just been knocked off top spot and managed to go backwards.\n\nSupporters of Badenoch acknowledge they would have liked to have seen her do better in the latest round. But they think there is a clump of Tugendhat supporters who really didn't like Jenrick\u2019s claim last week that British special forces are \u201ckilling rather than capturing terrorists\u201d because of the European Convention on Human Rights. They particularly disliked his use in a campaign video, external of footage of a comrade of Tugendhat\u2019s from his military days, who later died. \u201cRob is in trouble,\u201d one MP predicts \u2013 or hopes. So things are: Uncertain, mighty competitive and close. Tory MPs have to decide who they really do not want to be their leader and weigh up how party members might vote depending on the different potential pairings. The website ConservativeHome reckons, external that as things stand, James Cleverly could beat Robert Jenrick among the members, but Kemi Badenoch could beat James Cleverly. \u201cAccordingly, if MPs want to stop Cleverly from winning, backing Badenoch seems their best. \"And if they want to stop Badenoch, a vote for Jenrick beckons,\" as the ConservativeHome puts it. It is enough to make your head spin. Little wonder rumours are rife that all sorts of jiggery pokery has been going on - and could still be going on. Team Badenoch are playing hardball with an argument about her seeming popularity with party members. But they do so knowing some MPs really do not want her as leader. \u201cWhat will members say if they have to vote for two people they didn\u2019t want?\u201d says one. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like Liz and Rishi all over again, when the members wanted Penny vs Kemi,\u201d they add, in reference to Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt in the contest in 2022 and the prospect of a Cleverly-Jenrick run off. It leaves me pondering how the party would react if Badenoch is rejected by MPs. So, the stakes are high \u2013 as the Conservative Party approaches its biggest single moment yet since its calamitous election defeat in July.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Watch the moment Bianca Williams is taken out of a car and handcuffed by police\n\nTwo former Metropolitan Police officers have been handed their jobs back and will receive back-pay after winning an appeal against their dismissal following their stop and search of two athletes. Met PCs Jonathan Clapham and Sam Franks were fired in October 2023 after their search of the Olympic sprinters Bianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos. The two men won their appeal against a ruling which found they lied by saying they could smell cannabis during the stop and search in west London in July 2020. Mr Dos Santos described the appeal decision as \"disappointing\" and said he and Ms Williams would challenge it in the civil courts.\n\nDuring the incident, the couple were pulled over by the officers and searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons, but nothing was found. The officers had followed Ms Williams and her partner Mr Dos Santos as they drove home from training with their baby, who was then three months old. Mr Clapham and Mr Franks were dismissed after a disciplinary panel found they had lied about smelling cannabis when they pulled over the athletes. Their dismissal was overturned by the Police Appeals Tribunal, which found the panel's decision was \"irrational\" and \"inconsistent\".\n\nBianca Williams and Ricardo Dos Santos said they would challenge the appeal decision\n\nThe dismissed PCs were \"dedicated, hard-working and much respected officers\" whose reputations had been \"ruined\" by the original findings, Appeals Tribunal chairman Damien Moore said. \"Both officers did not lie. Both officers will now be reinstated to the Met Police. They should receive back-pay,\" he said. \"Being a police officer in London brings about its own set of unique challenges,\" Mr Moore added. He wished Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos \"all good fortune\". Hugh Davies, representing Mr Clapham, said the officers had \"every reason to suspect criminality\" when they pulled Dos Santos over. Mr Davies said another officer at the scene had smelled cannabis, but was not found to have lied.\n\nIn response to the appeal ruling, Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jon Savell said: \u201cWe know this has been an overly lengthy and horrendous process for PC Clapham and PC Franks, as well as their families and colleagues.\" He added that the case had been \"hard on all involved\" and re-emphasised a previous apology from the force to Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos over the stop and search. \"Ultimately, the evidence has shown that the stop and search and the actions of the officers did not amount to misconduct,\" Mr Savell said. \"However, stop and search is most effective when used with the trust and confidence of Londoners.\" He added the new \"stop-and-search charter\" would help rebuild trust.\n\nIn a statement following the tribunal decision, Mr Dos Santos maintained that the \"actions and allegations\" by the officers had been \"completely unacceptable\". \"Our drive home from training in 2020, with our baby, should never have turned into a violent incident where we were wrongly accused of smelling of drugs,\" he said. \"We are professional athletes; we pride ourselves on not doing drugs.\" He added: \"We shall challenge today's outcome in the civil courts. Jules Carey, of the law firm Bindmans, which represents the couple, said the complaints system had \"failed again\" and it \"will be for the civil courts to address this result\".\n\nRick Prior, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the officers had been \"fully exonerated and their reputations have rightly been restored\". \"Justice has been served. Why it ever got to this point, however, remains an absolute mystery,\" he said. Mr Prior said the reinstatements were \"yet another damning indictment\" of the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which referred the officers to the misconduct tribunal. \"Our colleagues have been dragged through hell and back for four years, for doing nothing more or less than the job the public of London expect us to do,\" he added. An IOPC spokesperson said: \"We note the outcome today of the officers' appeal and await the written decision by the Police Appeals Tribunal.\"\n\nMs Williams won silver at the Paris Olympics as part of the relay team\n\nMs Williams had alleged that racial profiling played a factor in the officers' conduct, but this was not upheld in the original misconduct tribunal. At the Paris Olympics this summer, she competed as part of the women's 4x100m quartet that qualified for the final and went on to win a silver medal.",
    "Surgeon operated with penknife he uses to cut up lunch\n\nPolice are looking into at least 105 cases of alleged medical negligence at the NHS trust\n\nA surgeon at a crisis-hit NHS trust used a Swiss Army penknife to open up the chest of a patient because he claimed he could not find a sterile scalpel. University Hospitals Sussex has said the operation was an emergency, but the surgeon\u2019s actions were \u201coutside normal procedures and should not have been necessary\u201d. Prof Graeme Poston, an expert witness on clinical negligence and a former consultant surgeon, told the BBC: \u201cIt surprises me and appals me. Firstly, a penknife is not sterile. Secondly it is not an operating instrument. And thirdly all the kit [must have been] there.\" Police are separately looking into at least 105 cases of alleged medical negligence at the trust and considering gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges.\n\nThe surgeon in the penknife case, who the BBC is not naming, was operating on a patient at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton when he struggled to find a scalpel. Instead he used a Swiss Army knife which he normally used to cut fruit for his lunch. The patient survived but internal documents show the surgeon\u2019s colleagues felt his behaviour was \u201cquestionable\u201d and were \u201cvery surprised\u201d he was unable to find a scalpel. The BBC has also discovered the same surgeon carried out three supposedly low-risk operations in two months where all three patients died soon after.\n\nThe BBC has previously reported that:\n\u2022 None Four whistleblowers said patients had died unnecessarily and been \u201ceffectively maimed\u201d at the trust\n\u2022 None A former surgeon claimed a \u201cgang culture\u201d existed in the neurosurgery department. The same doctor alleged one surgeon had disproportionate deaths and a second did complex operations without adequate training\n\u2022 None An internal review conceded doctors could have saved the life of student Melissa Zoglie had they acted sooner\n\u2022 None Sussex Police has recruited extra staff as part of its manslaughter probe concerning the trust\n\u2022 None A Royal College of Surgeons review found a \u201cculture of fear\u201d at the trust and suggested senior managers may need to be replaced\n\u2022 None The trust lost a nine-month legal battle with the BBC and The Times to block access to and redact documents in two employment tribunal cases\n\nThe trust launched a series of internal investigations into the three patients who died - and concluded that they had experienced \u201cpoor care\u201d. It also conceded one woman who died \u201cwould have survived if there were no post-operative complications\u201d. The woman\u2019s daughter, who asked not to be identified, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand how mum died. No one seemed to know why the operation was not successful. \u201cThere needs to be a thorough investigation into these deaths, not just an action plan. That\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nPolice say the trust is cooperating fully with the investigation\n\nHealth watchdog the Care Quality Commission looked at the deaths and concluded there had been no breach of regulations. University Hospitals Sussex said: \u201cOur investigations did not raise concerns about the surgeries themselves but did identify common themes for improvement, which we acted on immediately to ensure our services are as safe as possible. \u201cThese included better communication with patients before and after surgery, improved training for end-of-life care, and strengthened processes especially when care is transferred from one site to another.\u201d Prof Poston said these operations usually had a 1% chance of ending in death. After reviewing the surgeon\u2019s employment record, which included a long wait to become a consultant, Prof Poston said: \"I do not know this individual, but you would be concerned that there were problems during the course of that training and progression through training.\u201d\n\nShortly before the deaths, the operations had temporarily been moved to Worthing Hospital from a bigger site in nearby Brighton against some clinical advice. Trust chief executive George Findlay was told by colleagues they had safety concerns about moving the location of the operations. The trust\u2019s position did not change. University Hospitals Sussex said the decision to move the surgeries had included \u201ca thorough process\u2026 with oversight from the executive team\u201d. In response to the wider police investigation of the trust, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of concerning reports currently under investigation by Sussex Police and our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones. \u201cIt is vital police officers are given the space and support to properly investigate these matters. \"Sussex Police has confirmed University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust is cooperating fully with this investigation.\u201d\n\nDr Findlay said: \u201cI want to reassure all of our patients and staff that in each of the cases outlined in this report, thorough investigations took place, and action was taken whenever necessary to ensure lessons were learnt. \u201cWe were in touch with these families to express our sincere sympathies for their loss. \u201cIf we ever fall short of the standards people have a right to expect, then we are open, honest, and move swiftly to make improvements.\" He said the trust faced a number of long-standing challenges, and its teams were working hard to address them. \u201cI am proud of the progress they have made and they will be supported to make the further improvements we know are necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?",
    "Trudeau says the cuts to Canada's immigration targets will pause population growth over the next two years\n\nCanada has announced a sharp cut in the number of immigrants it allows into the country in an effort to \"pause population growth\", marking a notable shift in policy for the Justin Trudeau government. As part of the changes, Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents in 2025 from a previous target of 500,000 to 395,000 - a 21% drop. Prime Minister Trudeau said his government \"didn't get the balance quite right\" when it bolstered immigration post-pandemic to address labour shortages. Public support for immigration in Canada has been waning, with opinion polls suggesting rising concern over the growing numbers and its impact on housing and social services.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of already announced reduced targets for both international students and temporary foreign workers. On Thursday, Trudeau and Canada's immigration minister Marc Miller announced further cuts, this time to the number of new permanent residents. The goal, Miller said, is to set a smaller target of 365,000 new permanent residents by 2027. This reduction will pause population growth in Canada over the next two years, Trudeau said, giving provinces time to catch up on bolstering their healthcare programmes and housing stock. The prime minister said that \"Canadians are justifiably proud\" of their welcoming immigration system, which he said had helped bolster the country's economy and build diverse communities. \u201cOur immigration system has always been responsible and it has always been flexible,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe are acting today because of the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn\u2019t get the balance quite right.\u201d The vast majority of Canada\u2019s population growth last year - about 97% - was driven by immigration, according to federal data. At the same time, Canada\u2019s unemployment rate has increased to 6.5% and stands at over 14% for young people. The move marks a departure from decades of open immigration policies in Canada, which has relied on newcomers to meet population targets and to fill labour gaps. Since Trudeau was elected in 2015, his government has raised annual permanent resident targets from 272,000 to 485,000 this year. The biggest jump was seen in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic. Trudeau and his government have been criticised for increasing immigration without bolstering services or housing construction, and economists have warned that Canada's rapidly growing population has put a strain on housing and public services like healthcare. Earlier this month, a poll by the Environics Institute, which has tracked Canadians' attitudes towards immigration since 1977, revealed that 58% of Canadians now feel that immigration levels were too high. The institute said the findings suggest that public opinion on immigration levels has \"effectively flipped from being acceptable (if not valuable) to problematic\". The cuts to immigration targets have been criticised by advocacy groups like the Migrant Rights Network, who wrote in an open letter to Trudeau and Miller that migrants are being unfairly blamed for Canada's affordability crisis. \"Migrants are not responsible for Canada\u2019s housing crisis, lack of jobs, or inadequate healthcare or other public services,\" they said. The group added that these issues are rather a result of \"decades of federal and provincial policies that have underfunded and privatized public services\".",

In a statement, police said they discovered Payne's body after an emergency crew responded to an call in the upscale neighbourhood of Palermo on Wednesday. On Thursday, police in Buenos Aires said a preliminary autopsy suggests Liam Payne died from external and internal bleeding injuries. The police inspected the area where Payne fell, and found items including alcohol and a phone. Medication was found in his room. Payne had risen to global fame as part of the much-loved boyband created on the X Factor TV show in 2010, along with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik.\n\nAccording to police in Buenos Aires, officers at the scene were initially responding to reports \"of an aggressive man who may have been under the effects of drugs and alcohol\". When they arrived at the hotel, officials were told a loud sound had been heard in an interior courtyard. Soon after, they discovered the body there. A police investigation was then launched. Emergency medical services director Alberto Crescenti told local media that Payne had suffered \"serious injuries\" and that an autopsy will be carried out. Mr Crescenti declined to answer questions about the circumstances of Payne's fall from the balcony. The star's body has been transferred to a morgue in the city.\n\nWatch now on iPlayer (UK only)\n\nPolice in Buenos Aires confirmed on Thursday that an inspection of the scene where Payne fell has been carried out on the hotel\u2019s ground floor. They said that a bottle of whiskey, a lighter, and a mobile phone were found. Police said \"everything indicates that the musician was alone when the fall happened\", and that he had died at the scene and there were no injuries that suggested a third party had been involved. In the hotel room where Payne was staying, staff found \u201ctotal disorder\u201d including \u201cvarious items broken.\u201d They said this included several packets of medication, including Clonazepam, external, as well as over-the-counter medications. A notebook and passport were also found at the scene.\n\nEvidence and finger prints have been collected and the room\u2019s balcony has also been inspected to establish access to it. Five witness statements were taken by the police on the night, three from hotel employees and two from women who had been in the room with Payne earlier on, but were not there at the time of the fall. Payne posted on Snapchat just hours before the incident, saying: \"It's a lovely day here in Argentina\" but the video was from earlier in the week where he had spent time with his girlfriend Kate Cassidy.\n\u2022 None Boy band star who had the X factor\n\u2022 None The former One Direction star's life in pictures\n\nThe UK Foreign Office confirmed it was in touch with authorities in Argentina \"regarding reports of the death of a British man\". No further details were given. Once news of his death broke, fans began gathering outside the Buenos Aires hotel where the death took place, prompting police to cordon off the entrance. Some lit candles in his memory. \"I was in my living room and my sister told me Liam died,\" a young fan named Violeta Antier told Reuters news agency. \"We couldn't believe it. We came here directly to confirm it was true.\" Ms Antier said she saw Payne at the Niall Horan concert just two weeks ago. Another woman cried as she explained why she had come to the hotel, telling Reuters in Spanish: \"This is the only way I have to say goodbye to him\". One Direction had global success with hits such as What Makes You Beautiful and Story of My Life, while Payne also enjoyed some solo success after the band announced in 2015 that they were going on hiatus the following year.\n\nFans gathered outside the Buenos Aires hotel where Liam Payne was found dead\n\nIn August this year, Payne was announced as a judge on a new Netflix talent show alongside former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland and The Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger. Payne, who was born in Wolverhampton in the UK, first tried for stardom when he auditioned for ITV talent show The X Factor in 2008 \u2013 but judge Simon Cowell told him to \"come back in two years\". He did, impressing the judges more in 2010, and was put together with four other solo hopefuls at the boot camp stage and One Direction were born. The group had four UK number one albums and four number one singles as well as topping charts around the world, before Zayn Malik left in 2015, prompting the band's hiatus. In 2017, Payne's debut solo single Strip That Down, which peaked at number three on the Official UK Chart, and his collaboration with Rita Ora on the song For You - from the Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack \u2013 also reached the top 10. He began a relationship with Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy in 2016 and they had a son, Bear, the following year. The couple split in 2018. The BBC has seen a cease and desist letter against the singer earlier this week from another of Payne's former partners, Maya Henry. She had posted on social media accusing him of repeatedly contacting her. Payne did not respond to the accusations.",

Crash that killed four teens was avoidable, inquest hears\n\nA crash that killed four teenage boys when they drowned in an overturned car could have been avoided, an inquest has heard. Hugo Morris, 18, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Jevon Hirst, 16, all from Shrewsbury, died when their car left a rural road while they were on a camping trip last November. It flipped on to its roof in a flooded ditch, leaving the four A-level students trapped. A conclusion of road traffic collision was recorded by the senior coroner for North West Wales.\n\nThe teenagers had been visiting Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, when they set off from Harlech on 19 November to spend the night camping. But the Ford Fiesta being driven by Hugo left the A4085 road near the villages of Garreg and Llanfrothen. The crashed car could not be seen from the road and led to a massive two day search to find the boys. The inquest was told that a passing refuse recycling truck spotted the upturned car while on its round on the Tuesday morning.\n\nAll four students were found dead in the car. The inquest was told that post-mortem examinations revealed none of them had any internal or external injuries, and had died as a result of drowning. Giving evidence to the hearing, crash investigators for North Wales Police said there were \"no catastrophic mechanical failures\" with the car. However, both rear tyres were only half the required inflated pressure for carrying four people.\n\nMr Thompson said, in his view, Hugo had driven into a bend on the road too fast, causing the vehicle to come off the road. He said he calculated the maximum theoretical speed around the bend was 38mph. But he added: \"Having driven the bend myself the fastest speed I felt comfortable negotiating the bend was 26mph.\" He said the Ford Fiesta had entered that bend at a speed that was in excess of the limit to negotiate it, even though that may well have been below the road's 60mph limit. Mr Thompson said the actions of Hugo Morris needed to be considered in the accident. While it had been raining heavily, with leaf cover on the road, the investigator said he did not consider weather conditions played a role in the collision. But he said in his view, the crash \"was avoidable\".\n\nDelivering her conclusion, senior coroner Kate Robertson noted that there had been inadequate signage on the approach to the bend. She said she will also be writing to Cyngor Gwynedd and the landowner by the crash site about the need for fencing or barriers at the location. The coroner will also write to the UK government, raising her own concerns over newly qualified drivers being able to carry passengers. \"Having considered and heard the evidence I do have a concern,\" she said.\n\u2022 None A town in mourning for boys 'so full of promise'\n\nTributes were read out to all the boys by the coroner. Harvey's mother Crystal said he was \"perfect from the minute he came into the world and continued to be until he was tragically taken from us\". \"Harvey had the biggest, warmest smile that radiated love and calmness and a contagious positive energy,\" she said.\n\nHarvey Owen \"always had a soft spot for people who he knew were struggling to fit in or felt they were having a bad time,\" said his mother Crystal\n\nShe said \"every parent's worst nightmare came true\" last November and Harvey's family now faced \"a lifetime of grieving the life he should be living, the time we should have had with him and the memories we should be creating\".\n\nHeather Sanderson, Wilf's mother, said she was \"very proud\" of her son, who was \"so kind and had a lovely sense of humour\". \"I will miss him for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe car carrying the four teens came off the A4085\n\nIn a statement the mother of Jevon said he was \"happiest when he was at home with his family\". \"He was really close to his family and was loved,\" said Melanie Hirst.\n\nThe parents of Hugo said their son had a \"thirst for life\". \"No words can express our loss,\" said Dominic and Sarah Morris. \"Our world is shattered, bent and cracked. He is impossible to forget.\"\n\nHarvey's mother, Ms Owen, said the death of her son and his friends has led to her launching a campaign to change the law for younger drivers. She has started an online petition calling for the introduction of a graduated driving licence. It would require new learners to have at least six months training before being able to apply for a test. It would also ban newly-qualified drivers from carrying passengers under the age of 25 for the first six months, without an older adult present. Speaking outside the coroner's court, Ms Owen said she was \"very happy\" with the outcome but the government still needed to act. She said: \"My son was able to get in the back of a car driven by a young, inexperienced driver and be driven on an unfamiliar rural road without my knowledge. He was let down by an outdated driving licence system.\"",

    "Striking Boeing workers are set to vote on a new offer from the aviation giant, which includes a 38% pay rise over the next four years. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union, which represents more than 30,000 striking workers, has endorsed the offer and says it will hold a ballot of its members on Monday. The walkout started on 13 September, leading to a dramatic slowdown in production and deepening a crisis at the firm. The union had previously called for a 40% pay increase and workers have rejected two previous offers, including the last offer of a 35% rise.\n\nAs well as the proposed pay rise, the latest offer includes a $12,000 (\u00a39,300) bonus for the workers if a deal is reached, up from $7,000. \"It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,\" an IAM social media post said. \"We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success.\" Boeing said the offer would see average annual pay rise to $119,309 over the next four years. \"We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4,\" Boeing said in a statement. The new offer also includes changes to workers' retirement plans.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2.7% in extended trading in New York after the proposed deal was announced.

Last week, its commercial aircraft business reported operating losses of $4bn for the three months to the end of September. The company also launched a share sale to raise more than $20bn earlier this week. It came after warnings that a prolonged strike could lead to downgrades to Boeing's credit rating, which would make it more expensive for it to borrow money. The firm is also moving ahead with plans to lay off around 17,000 workers, with the first redundancy notices expected to be issued in mid-November. The latest crisis at Boeing erupted in January with a dramatic mid-air blowout of a piece of one of its passenger planes. Its space business also suffered a reputational hit after its Starliner vessel was forced to return to Earth without carrying astronauts.",
    "It has been a matter of 'when' not 'if' Joe Root would beat Sir Alastair Cook's England Test run-scoring record. This air of inevitability has been looming for the past 10 years and finally, with a century in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan, he cruised past with plenty left in the tank. I first bowled properly at Joe Root at the old stadium in Ahmedabad in 2012, before the massive Narendra Modi Stadium was built. He was a 21-year-old on his first England tour and I had been in the England side for more than two years. This was the famous series when we beat India 2-1 - the last time they lost at home. I had torn my quad on the first day of a warm-up game in Mumbai and was making my way back to fitness, building up my workload in the nets. The recovery was going well. I was just about up to full pace and decided to pick a ball that would reverse swing as a confidence booster, to take a few wickets and get the bounce in my run-up going. I always felt as though I attacked the crease and committed to the motion of bowling much better when the ball was reversing. I would predominantly swing the ball away from right-handers when the ball was reverse-swinging, to drag them and their head across their crease and to threaten the outside edge, then bowl an effort-ball inswinger when the batter was least expecting it. At the time I was capable of bowling upwards of 90mph and could rush some of the best players in the world. I was dragging Root across the crease, moving his head outside off stump and then tried my first inswinger. He played it with perfect balance, eyes level, under his nose to mid-on as though he had telepathically read what I was trying to do. For such a young player, he just felt different.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWe continued this battle for the rest of the net. I would try to hide the ball, switching it in my hand as I was loading up. I may have even tried marginally over-stepping to try to beat him for pace. It didn't matter. He played me serenely for the rest of the net. This isn't to say playing me bowling well is a litmus test for being a good batter, far from it. But, from a bowler's point of view, you get a real sense of how good a batter is when you're bowling at them in the nets. It is a tight, enclosed space. More balls are bowled in a shorter space of time than during a game. It can be intense. A bowler gets an inclination of when a batter is a good player and Root certainly stood out from any other young batter I had bowled to at the time. Root arrived into a successful team. We won the Ashes in Australia and had been ranked number one in the world. There were some big names in there: Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Matt Prior. He was not overawed. Instead, he was immediately cheeky. The Joe Root grin we have seen so often throughout the past 12 years was there every day of his first tour. He played pranks and got stuck into the environment as though he was someone who was going to be in that dressing room for a long time. The only time that smile evaded him was towards the end of his captaincy tenure. Thankfully it returned straight after.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA sign of how good a person Root is, is how he settled back into the ranks once his great mate Ben Stokes took over the captaincy. Even though it was clear he wanted to carry on as skipper after the West Indies series of 2022, Root doubled down on the style of play Stokes wanted. The message that sent to the dressing room would have been huge and one of the reasons the changeover of captaincy was so seamless. Root has always had an ability to adapt and evolve. He is never satisfied and never stands still. For everything which comes naturally to him, like the straight-bat punch off the back foot through backward point, there are other things he has had to work at in order to survive and excel, especially in foreign conditions: rotating the strike from spin off both front and back foot, becoming so selective about how and when he plays his sweeps (not to be confused with reverse scoops). It is not a stretch to say he is renowned as the best batter in the world in sub-continental conditions for visiting teams from outside Asia. Root has an insatiable hunger for runs. When he gets an opportunity to go big, he will rarely throw it away. He had troubles early in his career converting fifties to hundreds. Those experiences have made him realise the opportunity to score centuries doesn't just grow on trees. You can see the concentration and determination in his eyes when he is not willing to leave any runs out there. In his first 97 Tests he scored 17 hundreds and 49 fifties. In the 49 Tests up to this series he scored 17 hundreds and 15 fifties. A quite remarkable conversion rate. The next statistical aim for Root is Sachin Tendulkar's all-time Test run-scoring record of 15,921. Root is only 33 and at his current rate of scoring it would take him 38 Tests to overhaul 'The Little Master'. It is not inconceivable this feat could be completed within three years. Root has been bullish about not being close to satisfied at merely surpassing Cook, and that he has many more Test runs in his sights. It is a comforting thought for England fans. Psychologically, he may consider a stack of runs in a successful away Ashes series win as the prize to top off a magnificent career. In Australia, Root averages 35.68 with no hundreds. He has played in some horror shows of series down under and might be grateful to catch Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins well into their 30s next winter. England's greatest ever batter has two more peaks to conquer. He isn't done yet.\n\u2022 None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "P&O owner to attend summit despite row over minister's comments\n\nP&O Ferries owner, DP World, will now attend the UK's investment summit on Monday, despite a row over a minister's criticism of the firm. It had been feared they might pull out from the summit - where they were expected to announce a \u00a31bn investment - after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh criticised the ferry firm and urged consumers to boycott the company. An expansion of the firm's London Gateway port, in Essex, is likely to go ahead, with an announcement expected by some in the coming days. Whitehall sources said on Saturday that there had been \"warm engagement\" between senior figures in the firm and the government since Sir Keir Starmer distanced himself from his minister's remarks.\n\nThe government is hosting the International Investment Summit, where it hopes to attract billions of pounds of investment. A Downing Street spokesperson said the summit would \"show Britain is open for business\" as it looks to enable economic growth. Later, a government source said the prime minister had confidence in Haigh. A government spokesperson said: \"DP World\u2019s investment in Britain is a vote of confidence in the stability and seriousness of the government. We welcome the jobs and opportunities it will create.\" They added that the government was unlocking the UK's \"potential and ambition\" by working in partnership with businesses and investors around the world. DP World has said the expansion of the London Gateway port would bring Thurrock hundreds of jobs. The United Arab Emirates-based company also owns the container port in Southampton. It has yet to comment publicly on the latest developments. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast on Friday, Sir Keir said Haigh's comments were \"not the view of the government\". The prime minister is understood not to have been directly involved in talks with DP World, nor has he personally spoken to Haigh about her remarks.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. P&O criticism 'not view of the government', says Starmer\n\nThe row started after Haigh described P&O as a \"rogue operator\" in an interview with ITV on Wednesday, after it sacked nearly 800 seafarers in 2022 and replaced them with cheaper workers. Asked whether she used the ferry service, she said: \"I've been boycotting P&O Ferries for two-and-a-half years and I would encourage consumers to do the same.\" DP World insisted the move was needed for the survival of the ferry operator and to secure thousands of jobs. Haigh's comments in the interview coincided with the Department for Transport announcing new legislation aimed at protecting seafarers' jobs from so-called \"fire and rehire\" practices of \"rogue employers\". In that announcement, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner was quoted calling P&O Ferries' prior actions \"outrageous\". But senior government figures have since told the BBC that they were incensed by the specific suggestion that consumers boycott the ferry firm. Haigh's comments also attracted criticism from the Conservatives, with shadow business secretary Kevin Hollinrake arguing Labour \"don't understand business\". However, the Labour chair of the House of Commons Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, defended Haigh. She had been \"absolutely right to say that the behaviour of P&O, owned by DP World, in the past has been completely unacceptable\", he said. The row has exposed a tension between the new government's desire to attract business and strengthen workers' rights.",
    "Standing on a podium in a Florida convention centre on the night of the election, a row of American flags behind him and a jubilant crowd looking on, Donald Trump declared: \u201cMany people have told me that God spared my life for a reason, and that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\u201d\n\nThis was one of the most striking themes of his election campaign - that he had been chosen by God.

Additionally, a number of rail services were cancelled from the new Grand Central Station due to \"operational reasons\". In a post on X, formerly Twitter, the transport operator said some bus services in and out of the city centre are experiencing delays of approximately 35 minutes. \"Apologies for any delay and inconvenience,\" it said. The transport provider also issued warnings to commuters on Thursday evening as a result of heavy traffic in and out of Belfast city centre.\n\nDigital signage informed commuters that some services have been delayed or cancelled due to roadworks\n\nOn the rail network, the 18:04 BST Portadown to Belfast Grand Central service was cancelled. Translink said the 18:43 Belfast Grand Central to Lisburn service was also cancelled. A number of other trains, including the Enterprise service between Belfast and Dublin, and the Bangor to Belfast line, faced delays. \"Due to operational reasons, we have disruption to train services this evening,\" Translink posted on X, adding a further apology for the inconvenience.

It said that on Thursday afternoon, there were a number of collisions across the city, including an eight-vehicle crash on the M1 southbound between Broadway and Stockmans Lane. This brought traffic to a standstill. The DfI said the crash resulted in long delays back long the M1 and Westlink and onto the M3 and M2. \"The recovery operation took quite some time and again traffic was brought to a standstill at peak rush hour,\" the DfI said. During this recovery operation, another collision happened on the M3's Lagan Bridge east-bound. This caused delays for traffic approaching from the Westlink and M2. \"Both incidents occurred during the peak rush hour period and the time required to ensure that emergency services could attend, and the vehicles could be recovered also had a knock-on effect on some public transport services,\" the DfI said. The Department said it understands that traffic delays are \"frustrating\" and urged commuters to consider using public transport.\n\nOn Friday, Hospitality Ulster and Retail NI called for a return of a pre-Christmas moratorium on city centre roadworks. In a joint statement, the two organisations said the call \"comes admist further traffic congestion in the city... causing major disruption\". The organisations' chief executives have written to the DfI to seek a meeting with Minister for Infrastructure John O'Dowd to discuss the possible move. Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster and Glyn Roberts from Retail NI said: \"For weeks now we have seen bad traffic congestion in the city centre associated with the roadworks, but as seen yesterday, one accident can turn bad congestion into a complete standstill.\" \"If traffic and public transport congestion continues as is and worsens the closer, we get to Christmas, people simply won't come to the city centre.\"\n\nInfrastructure Minister John O\u2019Dowd earlier this week urged people to use public transport\n\nEarlier this week, John O\u2019Dowd, who oversees bus and rail services in Northern Ireland, urged commuters to consider public transport, instead of driving. A year-long closure of Durham Street, a busy road in central Belfast, has led to fears of more congestion in the city. O'Dowd had hoped the start of rail services on Sunday from the new Grand Central Station in the city would encourage more people to use public transport. However, the redevelopment of the area surrounding the new station is blamed by many drivers for causing the traffic problems in the first place.",
    "BBC presenter Paddy McGuinness will start his ultra-endurance challenge later\n\nTV presenter Paddy McGuinness has said Sir Chris Hoy pushed him to his \"absolute limits\" when they trained together ahead of his ultra-endurance cycling challenge for BBC Children in Need. McGuinness, 51, is set to ride nearly 300 miles (483km) when he sets off from Wrexham in Wales later, before aiming to arrive at the finish line on Friday in Glasgow, Scotland. \"Chris Hoy has been absolutely, as you can imagine with someone like him, outstanding, first class, brilliant with his advice,\" McGuinness said. \"When I go on a bike ride with Chris, I really know about it, because he pushes me to my absolute limits,\" he added.\n\nPaddy McGuinness said Sir Chris Hoy had been \"brilliant with his advice\"\n\nMcGuinness, who hosts a Sunday morning show on BBC Radio 2, will cycle through three nations and eight counties on a modified Raleigh Chopper bike.

    "Sara Sharif's body was found at her home in Woking on 10 August last year\n\nThe father of 10-year-old Sara Sharif called police from Pakistan and admitted he killed her at their Surrey home, a court heard. Urfan Sharif made the confession in an eight minute-call about an hour after his family\u2019s flight had landed in Islamabad on 10 August last year, before Sara's body was found. Mr Sharif, 42, Sara's stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, and her uncle Faisal Malik, 29, have denied murdering the girl at the Old Bailey. Jurors were told Mr Sharif's case was that Ms Batool was responsible for Sara's death and his confession on the phone call and also in a note was false to protect her.\n\nProsecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC told the court Sara had been the victim of violent assaults for \u201cweeks and weeks, at least\u201d, before he listed a series of injuries she had suffered. He said Sara had external and internal injuries, including extensive bruising, burns and broken bones, old and new. She had burns to her buttocks, caused by a domestic iron, and six \u201cprobable human bite marks\u201d to her arms and legs, the prosecution said. Dental impressions ruled out that the bite marks had been caused by the male defendants, but Ms Batool had refused to provide the impressions, the court heard. Sara also suffered injuries to her ribs, shoulder blades, fingers and 11 separate fractures to her spine, as well as signs of a traumatic brain injury, the prosecution added.\n\nUrfan Sharif, Beinash Batool and Faisal Malik are each facing two charges relating to the death of Sara Sharif\n\nMr Sharif called Surrey Police from Pakistan where the family had fled before her body was found and told the operator that he killed his daughter. The prosecutor said that in the call, which lasted eight minutes and 34 seconds, Mr Sharif told the operator that he \u201clegally punished her\u201d and she died. Later in the call to police, Sara\u2019s father was said to have told the operator that Sara had been naughty and that he then beat her up, jurors heard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much\u201d, the prosecutor said Mr Sharif went on to tell the operator.\n\nHowever, Mr Emlyn Jones KC added: \u201cSara had not just been beaten up. Her treatment, certainly in the last few weeks of her life, had been appalling and brutal.\u201d The court also heard that next to Sara\u2019s body was a note in Urfan Sharif\u2019s handwriting. Mr Emlyn Jones KC said it read: \u201cWhoever see this note it\u2019s me Urfan Sharif who killed my daughter by beating. I am running away because I am scared but I promise I will hand over myself and take punishment. \u201cI swear to God that my intention was not to kill her but I lost it.\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC added: \u201cAs in the 999 call, on the face of it, the note appears to be a confession to having caused Sara\u2019s death by beating her up.\u201d\n\nJurors also heard that police found Sara\u2019s body on a bottom bunkbed under covers as if she was asleep. \u201cBut she was not asleep, she was dead,\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC told the jury. The three defendants, who lived with Sara before her death in August last year, are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they deny. Mr Emlyn Jones KC added that each defendant was seeking to \u201cdeflect the blame\u201d onto one or both of the others. The prosecution said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that any of the adults could have carried out the abuse \u201cwithout the complicity, participation, assistance and encouragement of the others\u201d. \u201cNone of them ever reported Sara\u2019s abuse to any outside agency, who could have intervened,\u201d Mr Emlyn Jones KC added.\n\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external and X, external.

    "Joe Freeman with James and Arthur Dunley, who all took part in the contest\n\nThey came in their flat caps, waistcoats and with an ice-cool stare - all hoping to be crowned the best lookalike of Peaky Blinders' Tommy Shelby. The contest took place on Saturday in Birmingham city centre and follows the craze of celebrity doppelganger competitions currently sweeping the globe. Over 100 spectators gathered outside the Bullring to watch participants step forward with their best impression of Cillian Murphy's character. Based on levels of applause and a judges' opinions, 66-year-old Derek Brennan was named the winner.\n\nDerek Brennan said he thought he'd be too old to be crowned the winner\n\n\"My looks and my personality won me the competition, I can't help but be the best,\" Mr Brennan joked. Speaking to the BBC, he said he thought of himself as too old to be called a lookalike but friends had always said he resembled the hero of Steven Knight's hit series. \"People would tell me I look like him [Cillian Murphy] but I always thought I'd be too old so I joke and say I could be his dad.\"\n\nStudent Joe Freeman braved the rain and donned a suit after hearing about the contest on Instagram. He was so committed he got his hair cut the day before. \"I really love the Peaky Blinders and my auntie who is American always says I look like Thomas Shelby - I was going all out and here to win.\"\n\nA prize of a \u00a3500 shopping spree was up for grabs\n\nJames Dunley, 22, and his dad Arthur travelled from Telford, Shropshire, to take part. James said being amongst fans made the event exciting. \"I'm Irish so I share that connection with Cillian and I'm told that I have similar features as him as well,\" he said. \"I'm more here for the fans, the excitement and just meeting everybody. \"I became a huge fan of the show after people kept telling me I looked like Tommy.\" The series, which ran from 2013 to 2022, followed the escapades of a Birmingham crime gang in the years after World War One.

    "No one can doubt Israel\u2019s determination to defend its people, helped enormously by the might of the United States. It is clear though, that the war has shown that nobody can fool themselves that Palestinians will accept lives lived forever under an Israeli military occupation, without proper civil rights, freedom of movement and independence.\n\nAfter generations of conflict Israelis and Palestinians are used to confronting each other. But they are also used to living alongside each other, however uncomfortably. When a ceasefire comes, and with a new generation of leaders, there will be chances to push again for peace.\n\nBut that is a more distant future. The rest of the year and into 2025, with a new president in the White House, are uncertain and full of danger.\n\nFor months after Hamas attacked Israel, the fear was that the war would spread, and get worse. Slowly, and then very quickly, it happened, after Israel\u2019s devastating attacks on Hezbollah and Lebanon.\n\nIt is too late to say the Middle East is on the brink. Israel is facing off against Iran. The warring parties have plunged over it, and countries not yet directly involved are desperate not to be dragged over the edge.\n\nAs I write Israel has still not retaliated for Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. It has indicated that it intends to inflict a severe punishment. President Biden and his administration, Israel\u2019s constant supplier of weapons and diplomatic support, are trying to calibrate a response that might offer Iran a way to stop the accelerating climb up the ladder of escalation, a phrase strategists use to describe the way wars speed from crisis to disaster.\n\nThe proximity of the US elections, along with Joe Biden\u2019s steadfast support for Israel, despite his misgivings about the way it has been fighting, do not induce much optimism that the US will somehow finesse a way out.\n\nThe signals from Israel indicate that Netanyahu, Gallant, the generals of the IDF and the intelligence agencies believe they have the upper hand. October 7th was a disaster for them. All the major security and military chiefs, except the prime minister, apologised and some resigned. They had not planned for a war with Hamas. But planning for the war with Hezbollah started after the last one ended in 2006 in a humiliating stalemate for Israel. Hezbollah has suffered blows from which it might never recover.\n\nSo far Israel\u2019s victories are tactical. To get to a strategic victory it would need to coerce its enemies into changing their behaviour. Hezbollah, even in its reduced state, is showing that it wants to fight on. Taking on Israeli infantry and tanks now that south Lebanon has once more been invaded might negate some of Israel\u2019s advantages in air power and intelligence.\n\nIf Iran answers Israel\u2019s retaliation with another wave of ballistic missiles other countries might get pulled in. In Iraq, Iran\u2019s client militias could attack American interests. Two Israeli soldiers were killed by a drone that came from Iraq.\n\nSaudi Arabia is also looking on nervously. Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman has made clear his view of the future. He would contemplate recognising Israel, but only if the Palestinians get a state in return and Saudi Arabia gets a security pact with the United States.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s role, simultaneously trying to restrain Israel while supporting it with weapons, diplomacy and carrier strike groups, exposes the Americans to getting involved in a wider war with Iran. They don\u2019t want that to happen, but Biden has pledged that he will come to Israel\u2019s aid if it becomes necessary.\n\nIsrael\u2019s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, and the damage done to Iran\u2019s strategy and its \u201caxis of resistance\u201d is fostering a new set of illusions among some in Israel and the United States. The dangerous idea is that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the Middle East by force, imposing order and neutering Israel\u2019s enemies. Joe Biden \u2013 and his successor \u2013 should be wary of that.\n\nThe last time that restructuring the Middle East by force was contemplated seriously was after al-Qaeda\u2019s 9/11 attacks on America, when US President George W Bush and Tony Blair, the UK\u2019s prime minister, were getting ready to invade Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq did not purge the Middle East of violent extremism. It made matters worse.\n\nThe priority for those who want to stop this war should be a ceasefire in Gaza. It is the only chance to cool matters and to create a space for diplomacy. This year of war started in Gaza. Perhaps it can end there too.",
    "MP Chris Webb said he was not injured in the attack in the capital\n\nLabour MP Chris Webb has described being mugged in London by a gang who stole his mobile phone. Writing on X, external, the member for Blackpool South said he was attacked as he returned from parliament along Lambeth Walk to his flat in the capital at about 22:00 GMT on Monday night. The Labour MP said that while he is \"not an easy target\" as a \"big guy\" of 6ft 2in, a \"stealthy\" group on bikes clad in balaclavas managed to catch him off-guard. \"Luckily I have no injuries and I am ok,\" he said.\n\nDowning Street said Sir Keir Starmer's thoughts were with Mr Webb. A spokesman for the prime minister said there had been a shocking rise in people snatching bags and phones, and more must be done. Mr Webb told how he was mugged: \"I was walking to the shop. I was on the phone to my wife. \"I then literally said I think I jinxed myself, that I better get off my phone. I don't know this area and it's a bit dark. \"Got to the shop, said that and, as I'm walking away, went to reach into my pocket to get my phone to phone my wife back, and that's when they grab me. \"They grab my arm to stop me and then off they went,\" he said.\n\nThe MP was targeted in the robbery in central London on Monday\n\nThe gang made a quick getaway on their bikes, he added. Webb said he then locked his iPhone using his smartwatch and when police came, he helped them to track the phone to a location where a suspect was caught with a bag of phones and arrested. However, the MP's phone was not recovered. He added: \"I wasn't on the phone at the time and I didn't hear them, which is remarkable in itself, of how stealthy they are, because these are on bikes,\" he added. \"So the fact that, you know, and I'm normally pretty aware of my surroundings, I've got pretty decent reflexes and things like that from training and boxing training. \"And I'm just surprised, because if I grabbed hold of one of them, they would have gone flying on the bike, because I wouldn't have let go. So I'm kind of surprised how they managed to get so close to me without me realising.\"\n\nHe said his first instinct was to chase the group but he quickly realised he should instead get the phone tracked and locked and call the police. \"I don't think I was targeted as an MP,\" he continued. \"While I was in a suit and shirt and tie, they would not have known I was a member of parliament.\" He said the police went \"above and beyond\" to help him. The Metropolitan Police said officers were called at 21:55 GMT on Monday. \"The victim was approached by a group of men who stole his phone from his hand. Inquiries remain ongoing,\" the force said.\n\u2022 None MP sworn in at Commons after by-election win",
    "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTasha Ghouri was in tears on Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday night as she opened up about the negative reaction she has experienced online due to her disability. The former Love Island star, 26, and dancer partner Aljaz Skorjanec impressed the judges and got a joint series high score of 39 as they performed to What About Us by Pink. But before the dance, Ghouri, who was born deaf and uses a cochlear implant, became visibly emotional as she told viewers about online trolls who made videos about the way she speaks. She revealed that after her stint on dating show Love Island in 2022, she received an onslaught of cruel comments, leaving her feeling like she had let down \"the whole deaf community\".\n\nThe model, author and podcaster, from North Yorkshire, became Love Island's first deaf contestant when she appeared on the ITV show, eventually finishing joint fourth with boyfriend Andrew Le Page, who she is still in a relationship with. Ghouri said she joined the show to find love, as well as to raise awareness for the deaf community, but instead found herself the victim of online hate. \"When I left the show, I remember my dad sat me down and he looked at me straight and said 'Tash, there is a lot of horrific stuff that was written about you, especially on social media,'\" she said. \"There are videos made about my voice and the way I speak, it became a trend at one point.\"\n\nGhouri said the experience made her hit \"rock bottom\". \"Because I wanted to go on for representation and I feel like I failed, not just myself but, the whole deaf community,\" she said. But she insisted she would not let the trolls win. \"I'm going to use my platform and educate people,\" she said.\n\nToday, Ghouri has more than 2.2 million followers across her social media platforms. She has worked with Number 10 Downing Street and the Department for Education to champion issues on behalf of people who are deaf. Speaking ahead of the start of this year's Strictly series, Ghouri admitted how much the moment meant to her. \u201cI can't believe I'm going to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I\u2019ve been watching the show since I was little and it's a firm Ghouri family favourite, so this is a total dream come true,\" she said. Her appearance comes three years after Rose Ayling-Ellis became Strictly's first deaf contestant, and went on to win.\n\nJB Gill performed with Lauren Oakley, as Amy Dowden watched from the studio\n\nThe remaining 10 celebrities and their professional dance partners took to the ballroom floor on Saturday evening as part of Strictly Come Dancing's inaugural icons week. Taylor Swift and Beyonce were among the stars who were honoured during the show. JLS singer JB Gill and stand-in professional partner Lauren Oakley joined Ghouri and Skorjanec at the top of the leaderboard, scoring the joint highest number of points of this year's series. Professional dancer Amy Dowden, who is partnered with Gill, was forced to miss last Sunday's results programme after being taken to hospital as a \"precaution\" after she began \"feeling unwell\". Oakley stood in for her, performing a Bruno Mars medley with Gill on Saturday's show, which gave the pair a score of 39. The celebration of icons continues on Sunday night, when the professional dancers will perform a Beyonce medley with Johannes Radebe channelling the singer's alter-ego, Sasha Fierce.",
    "New Paddington film charming but slow, critics say\n\nThe nation's favourite bear is back for another adventure\n\nThe much-anticipated new Paddington in Peru film has had mixed reviews over its opening weekend, with critics calling it \"charming-enough\", but some agreeing the film struggles to reach the heights of its predecessors. The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy. The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November. Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.\n\nOf the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian, external that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\". In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote, external that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\". Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, external, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\". He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".\n\nBen Whishaw returns to voice the bear for the third time\n\nThe Telegraph's Tim Robey, external was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant. Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire, external: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears. \"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\" Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, external, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love. \"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"\n\nColman brings a musical charm to the film as the Reverend Mother\n\nThe director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton. Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, external, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\". Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, external, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\". She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\" Away from the big screen, a new Paddington musical is being developed for the stage, with McFly's Tom Fletcher set to write the music and lyrics. On November 7 the cast of the upcoming film unveiled special livery on a Great Western Railway (GWR) train that will travel through Devon and Cornwall.",
    "The city's roads have been blocked with shipping containers to stop the march reaching the centre\n\nSupporters of jailed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan have been pushed back by security forces after reaching the heart of the heavily-barricaded capital earlier on Tuesday. The convoy of opposition protesters has been marching towards Islamabad's D Chowk - or Democracy Square - since the weekend, demanding Khan's release, among other things. At least six people were killed - four paramilitary soldiers, and two protesters - as the march moved through the city, clashing with security forces at points. A number of protesters did make it as far as D Chowk however, and were seen scrambling over shipping containers placed to block their way.\n\nBut hours after protesters reached the square, security forces successfully cleared the area. As darkness fell, the lights were switched off - only police officers and paramilitary soldiers left behind. A police officer nearby said that some protesters had made it beyond the three-tier stack of shipping containers, but only a few hundred metres before they were pushed back. However, thousands of Khan supporters remain in the area - to keep warm in the biting cold, protesters have started burning paper and other materials inside rubbish bins. Many have even resorted to burning grass and bushes on the footpaths and greenbelts, where people are gathered. Muhammad Shahid, who came with his family all the way from Punjab province, says they\u2019re here because of Imran Khan\u2019s message: \u201cHe says we must fight for our rights.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand up for our fundamental rights. Imran Khan has been illegally arrested, and we will fight to make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nKhan, who has been in prison for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated, has urged his supporters not to give up - encouraging people to continue towards D Chowk. \"My message to my team is to fight till the end, we will not back down,\" the former prime minister said on X. Even from behind bars, the former cricket star has proved a powerful player in Pakistan politics. During elections in February, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which had been banned from standing and was forced to run candidates as independents, emerged as the single largest bloc. However, they fell short of the majority and their rivals united to form a new government. As a result, protesters are also calling for the overturning of election results they say were rigged - a claim disputed by the government. It was Khan who called on his supporters to take to the streets at the weekend, issuing a \"final call\" and asking them to stay in the capital until their demands are met.\n\nThe government - which had already introduced a ban on public gatherings -responded by blocking Islamabad's streets with shipping containers, and bussing in police from across the country. Restrictions also appear to have been brought in on some internet services, while schools and colleges have been shut because of fears of violence. Pakistan's interior minister said the protesters had been offered an alternative venue for their protest but had refused. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who blamed the protesters for the deaths of four soldiers on Tuesday, dismissed the march as \"extremism\". \"These disruptive elements do not seek revolution but bloodshed,\" he said in a statement. Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party, told news agency Reuters at least two protesters had been killed - one shot, and one run over by a vehicle. At least 50 people have been injured.\n\nAdditional reporting by Farhat Javed, Malik Mudassir and Fakhir Munir in Islamabad",
    "Bianca Gascoigne has alleged that she was groomed and sexually assaulted by former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed when she worked at the department store as a teenager. The TV personality, who is the adopted daughter of ex-England footballer Paul Gascoigne, was 16-years-old at the time, and said Al Fayed would grope her and force her to kiss him. She told Sky News, external that she did not speak out sooner because she did not want to bring \"embarrassment and shame\". Gascoigne's comments come after Harrods confirmed to the BBC on Monday that more than 250 people were now in its process to settle compensation claims brought by women who allege historical sexual misconduct again Al Fayed.\n\nWarning: this story contains details some may find distressing The 37-year-old reality TV star and DJ told the broadcaster she used to visit the luxury department store with her parents when she was growing up, and described Fayed as \"charming\" and \"personable\", saying he used to bring the family gifts. \"He used to tell me how much of a bad father my dad was, because he used to come into the store drunk,\" she said. \"He used to tell me that he was an embarrassment, that I should look to him as a father figure.\" She added she felt a \"false sense of security with him early doors\". Gascoigne joined Harrods as a shop floor worker but was later promoted to her \"dream \" job of becoming a fashion buyer. But she said Al Fayed would grope her and force her to kiss him during their weekly meetings.\n\nOn one occasion, Gascoigne was offered the opportunity to stay in the Harrods Park Lane apartment before an early morning work flight. But when Al Fayed turned up at the apartment, she said she was \"gobsmacked\", \"shell-shocked\" and did not know what to do. \"He came in, and then he sat me down on the sofa and was obviously very forceful with the touching and the kissing,\" she said. \"He got his privates out and got my hand and was trying to manoeuvre it on his parts, and when that didn't work, he was trying to force my head on his lap.\" She said she managed to \"wiggle away\" and the encounter was \"horrific\". She thinks Al Fayed knowing who her parents were was what saved her in the moment. \"He was doing all these things to me and I was close to people that he knew, and I felt like I couldn't even tell them either because I didn't want to bring embarrassment and shame,\" she said, adding that not even her mum and dad knew what was going on. Gascoigne said she was also scared of losing her job, and that Al Fayed had warned her that she would if she said anything.\n\nGascoigne, who gave birth to a daughter last year, said she was compelled to talk about her experience after several victims went public with their stories of abuse at the hands of Al Fayed. \"I feel like I have to do this, I want to do this, and I want to stand for the women and just hopefully make any kind of change (so) that in the future, my daughter wouldn't have to go through something like this,\" she said. Lawyers from the Justice for Harrods Survivors group, who represent the accusers of the former Harrods boss, have praised Gascoigne for her bravery, adding they are \"proud to represent her and our other survivors as we move forward together in our quest for justice\". The BBC has approached Gascoigne for further comment. Al Fayed, who died last year aged 94, is accused of sexual misconduct by several women who worked for him - many of whom felt unable to report what had happened until recently. At the time of many of the alleged attacks, the billionaire businessman was the owner of Harrods, the Ritz Paris hotel and football club Fulham FC. The BBC heard testimony from more than 20 female ex-employees at Harrods during its investigation for the documentary and podcast - Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods. The documentary, which aired last month, claimed that during Fayed's ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene but helped cover up abuse allegations. Responding to the investigation, Harrods' current owners said they were \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the allegations and that his victims had been failed - for which the store sincerely apologised.

    "A man was found with a gunshot wound on Linton Road in Barking, said police\n\nA murder investigation has been launched after a man was fatally shot in east London. The Metropolitan Police was called to reports of a man injured in Linton Road, Barking, at about 04:35 BST on Sunday. Officers and the London Ambulance Service found a man, believed to be in his 30s, with a gunshot injury. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

    "How a woman murdered her parents and hid the secret for four years\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"You caught the bad guy\": McCullough's confession was captured on police bodycam footage\n\nVirginia McCullough knew why the police had smashed through her front door, but part of her wondered why it took them so long to discover she had murdered her parents. \"Cheer up, at least you've caught the bad guy,\" she calmly told the officers handcuffing her. Neighbours thought John and Lois McCullough had retired to the seaside, but the reality was they were callously poisoned by their daughter. Why did she do it? The goings-on inside the McCullough family home in Great Baddow near Chelmsford, Essex, were becoming increasingly secretive in 2019. Relatives were asked to stay away and friends were told Mr and Mrs McCullough had retired to the Clacton area on Essex's sunshine coast. The gruesome reality was very different. It would be four years before anyone found out the horrors that took place behind closed doors on Pump Hill. John McCullough, a retired business studies lecturer, had been fatally poisoned and the 70-year-old's body was hidden in a crudely-built tomb made out of breeze blocks and blankets. The corpse of his 71-year-old wife, Lois, was stashed behind sleeping bags and duvets in an upstairs wardrobe. Mrs McCullough had been battered with a hammer and stabbed, but she too had also been poisoned with prescription medication administered by her daughter. Virginia McCullough, 36, was handed a life sentence at Chelmsford Crown Court for their murders, to serve a minimum of 36 years, on Friday.\n\n\"The curtains were always drawn and you couldn't see if anybody was in the house,\" said Phil Sargeant, who lived next door to the McCulloughs for 20 years. \"They were just like shadows, they'd move very quickly from A to B.\" Mr Sargeant now knows why there was such secrecy at his neighbours' house. \"I find it quite difficult even to say that Virginia murdered her parents or killed her parents,\" he added. \"She\u2019d come across as quite pleasant; she was funny, she was irreverent as well. She had a dark sense of humour.\"\n\nIn September 2023, Essex Police took a call from Essex County Council's safeguarding team. A GP at Mr and Mrs McCullough's registered practice had raised a concern for their welfare, having not seen them for some time.\n\nThe corpses of Mr and Mrs McCullough lay inside the family home for four years\n\nJohn McCullough's body was hidden in a makeshift tomb, covered with blankets and paintings\n\nTheir absences had been explained by their daughter, who offered a range of excuses for each appointment she cancelled on her parents' behalf. Conveniently for her, the country had been in Covid-enforced lockdowns for a large period of time they had not been seen. But when police spoke to McCullough, it became clear something was not adding up - why were her parents always out of the area? Alan Thomson, who rented a television to the McCulloughs, also had his suspicions. It followed a phone call from McCullough, abruptly cancelling the rental on her parents' behalf. When Mr Thomson's staff arrived at the family home to pick it up, they were told they could not enter the property - and the TV was already prepared by the front door. \"I got the feeling perhaps she was a bit of a fantasist, but no way would I have thought she\u2019d be a murderer,\" he said.\n\nWhen police raided the property, it was not the first time they had visited. Weeks prior to the discovery of the bodies, McCullough invited officers inside to discuss an allegation of an assault against her. Only she knew the intent of this call, but some believed she was testing the water. Ultimately, the assault allegation came to nothing.\n\nPost-mortem examinations found Mrs McCullough died of stab wounds and her husband was fatally poisoned, although both had been poisoned\n\nMcCullough was more forthcoming when officers returned in September 2023. \"I did know that this day would come eventually,\" she confessed. \"I deserve to get what's coming, sentence-wise, because that's the right thing to do and then that might give me a bit of peace.\" Documents recovered inside the property painted a picture of a woman desperately trying to keep her parents from discovering a financial black hole she had dug. Abusing their goodwill, she had been living rent free, spending their money and racking up large credit card debts in their names. Forged letters showed McCullough had been tricking her parents into thinking they had lost money through scams. In reality, it was money \"frittered away\" by their daughter.\n\nVirginia McCullough continued to spend her parents' pensions after murdering them\n\nTo them, she was well-qualified, suitably employed and working hard towards becoming an artist - a future she claimed would also bring financial benefits for her parents. Instead, she was reaping the financial rewards of manipulating, abusing and taking advantage of her parents' kindness. In total, McCullough benefited from \u00a3149,697 as a result of murdering her parents - combined from their pensions and spending on their credit cards, as well as selling assets. The court also heard she spent \u00a321,000 on online gambling between 2019 and 2023. Her lies - and the fear of being exposed - ultimately led to her cruelly killing her parents.\n\nThe McCullough family home has since been blocked up with metal security barriers\n\nPaul Hastings, a greengrocer at the Vineyards shopping centre near their home, had also noticed their disappearance. He was told by McCullough that her parents, who used to purchase goods from his shop, were no longer living in Great Baddow. Mr Hastings said her peculiar nature meant she could say things without arousing much suspicion. \"She came in to the shop and said 'The police are after me, they think I killed my mum and dad',\" Mr Hastings said. \"I thought 'That\u2019s a bit odd' but didn\u2019t think anything else of it, I just thought it was her eccentric nature.\" He explained McCullough would sometimes visit his shop four times a day, before disappearing for the next fortnight.\n\nVirginia McCullough was \"clearly taking advantage of her parents\u2019 goodwill\", Det Supt Rob Kirby said\n\nDebbie Pollard said McCullough would visit the flower shop she ran and bombard her with food and presents. \"We knew she was odd but I would never have dreamt she would ever be capable of doing what she actually did,\" she said. \"She\u2019s actually lived in that house all those years with her mum and dad\u2019s remains in there - that horrifies me. Horrifies me.\" Both Mr Hastings and Ms Pollard said McCullough had also pretended to be pregnant, even creating a fake bump under her clothing.\n\nDet Supt Rob Kirby said: \"The details of this case shock and horrify even the most experienced of murder detectives.\"\n\nThroughout her sentencing on Friday, McCullough stared at the floor, emotionless. It was only when she listened back to her interview with police, describing how she murdered her mother, that she began to weep. \"She looked so innocent; she was just sat there listening to the radio,\" McCullough told the officers. \"I did go in three times to build up some gumption but I knew I had to get it done and can\u2019t hesitate. \"She was just staring at me in disbelief.\"\n\nVirginia McCullough was jailed for life on Friday, to serve a minimum of 36 years behind bars\n\nDet Supt Rob Kirby, from Essex Police, said her otherwise composed reaction in court was typical of the \"considered, meticulous\" murderer she was. \"Throughout the course of our investigation, we have built a picture of the vast levels of deceit, betrayal and fraud she engaged in,\" he said. \"It was on a shocking and monumental scale. \"McCullough lied about almost every aspect of her life, maintaining a charade to deceive everyone close to her and clearly taking advantage of her parents\u2019 good will. \u201cShe is an intelligent and adept manipulator who chose to kill her parents callously and without a thought for them or those who continue to suffer as a result of their loss.\"\n\nDo you have a story suggestion for Essex?",
    "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it \u201cAmerica First\u201d. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington\u2019s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\n\nNato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.\n\u2022 None What Chinese people want from the US The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

    "David Cameron has urged the UK to consider sanctioning two Israeli ministers as a way of \"putting pressure\" on the country to act within international law. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, the former Conservative foreign secretary said before the election he had been \"working up\" plans to put sanctions on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. He described the two men as \"extremist\" and said using sanctions would send a message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that \"this is not good enough and has to stop\". The BBC has contacted Smotrich and Ben-Gvir for a response.\n\nLord Cameron said both men had \"said things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into Gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the West Bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out\". Earlier this year, Smotrich suggested it might be \"justified and moral\" to starve Gazans and has called for Palestinian residents to leave and make way for Israelis who could \"make the desert bloom\". Asked why the planned sanctions did not go ahead, Lord Cameron, who was foreign secretary between 2023 and 2024, said he had been advised that it would have been \"too much of a political act\" during the election. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned comments by the Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as \"entirely unacceptable\". Speaking at a Labour conference event, external last month, he said: \"We are very worried about escalatory behaviour, about inflamed tensions. \"I\u2019m absolutely clear, if we have to act, we will act. I\u2019m in discussions with G7 partners, particularly European partners, on that. I\u2019m not announcing further sanctions today but that is kept under close review.\" Asked in Parliament about sanctioning the Be-Gvir and Smotrich, Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said that the government kept its sanctions regime \"closely under review\" and would announce any changes.\n\nItamar Ben-Gvir (L) and Bezalel Smotrich (R) are part of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition in the Israeli parliament\n\nWhitehall sources have told the BBC that Lord Cameron's plan to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on both men had been well advanced and ready to go. The imposition of sanctions requires a detailed and legally binding case which takes time to compile. But they said the decision was put on hold for fear of inflaming political tensions during campaigning for the general election. There were concerns about triggering violence in constituencies where views about the Middle East were polarised. It is also understood the United States at the time opposed sanctioning Mr Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The UK tends to impose sanctions alongside US and the European Union to maximise their impact. The Foreign Office never comments on or predicts future sanctions decisions; however, some sources said any decision on sanctioning the two Israeli ministers might be delayed until after the US election. They also said that with such little UK leverage over Israel, domestic political factors may play a bigger part in any decision. Labour has already restricted UK arms sales to Israel, refunded the UN agency helping Palestinians, and lifted opposition to the International Criminal Court having the right to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.\n\nAnother decision against the Israeli government might be seen as one step too far. The sources also said there was the risk UK sanctions could be seen as a badge of honour by the two ministers. Tom Keatinge, from the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told the BBC that putting sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would be a \"significant move\" aimed at sending a \"major political message\" to Israel. He also said there was \"not a precedent\" for the UK government sanctioning elements of an ally country. He added that there were \"practical issues\" as sanctions required \"a lot of work\" and that the Foreign Office's sanctions director was already \"heavily overworked\" due to issues related to Russia. On Tuesday, the Foreign Office announced new sanctions targeted at illegal settler outposts and four organisations it said had \"supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank\". The three settler outposts hit by the financial restrictions are Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost, Meitarim Outpost, and Shuvi Eretz Outpost. The four organisations targeted are Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva, a religious school; Hashomer Yosh, a non-governmental organisation that provides volunteers for illegal outposts; Torat Lechima, an Israeli charity and Amana, a construction company that has overseen the establishment of outposts. The announcement follows previous sanctions announced in February, external and May., external The foreign secretary said the measures would \"help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights\".\n\nLord Cameron argued the UK government should seek to influence Israel by putting restrictions on some of its ministers instead of pursuing the \"wrong path\" of suspending arms exports. Last month, the UK government restricted arms sales to Israel saying there was a \"clear risk\" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law. But Lord Cameron said restricting arms sales to Israel while simultaneously helping to protect the country from Iranian attacks \"made no sense\". The former PM said everyone wanted to see the conflict end, but \"end in a sustainable way\". He said Israel had faced attacks from Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north and it was right to back the country's right to self-defence. \"But it is not a blank cheque, it is not unconditional,\" he said. \"We do want to make sure aid gets through into Gaza, we do want to see the role of the UN in Lebanon to be respected.\"",

    "Woman who starved to death was unlawfully killed\n\nDebbie Leitch's deterioation was concealed by her mother a coroner says\n\nA woman who starved to death after being neglected by her mother was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded. Debbie Leitch, 24, who had Down's syndrome, was found dead at her home in South Shore, Blackpool, on 29 August 2019. Alan Wilson, senior coroner for Blackpool and Fylde, said Debbie died from \"the combined effects of her severely emaciated and neglected state, and debilitation caused by widespread Norwegian scabies mite infection\". Her mother and full-time paid carer Elaine Clarke, who was jailed in 2022 for gross negligence manslaughter, refused to give evidence at the inquest.\n\nElaine Clarke refused to give evidence at the inquest\n\nIn his ruling Mr Wilson stated: \"Debbie [...] had care and support needs, and a range of carers and social care professionals would attend the home regularly to provide that care. \"Unbeknown to them, the standard of care shown by Debbie's mother was at times inappropriate, and she would take steps to actively try to mask how she was treating Debbie.\" He added: \"At other times, she may use disguised compliance to give professionals the false impression that she was doing what she could to comply with any plans to safeguard or promote Debbie's welfare when this was not the case, such as by agreeing to medical appointments which would then be missed, often providing a seemingly plausible explanation.\" Mr Wilson said when Debbie's cousin raised concerns after visiting the family home on 26 July 2019 with social services and her GP practice but by the time the GP arrived, Clarke had \"taken steps to make both Debbie and the house more presentable, and she reassured the GP that Debbie was being appropriately cared for\".\n\nSix days later, a visiting social worker attending the home \"was similarly reassured\". The coroner said Debbie was significantly neglected over the following weeks, remaining largely in her room. On 29 August, emergency services were called to the house and found Debbie lying on her bedroom floor. She had been dead for a number of hours. Mr Wilson said: \"The conditions in which she had been living were described as uninhabitable. \"As a result of the way she had been neglected over the preceding four weeks, a subsequent post mortem examination revealed she died from the combined effects of her severely emaciated and neglected state, and debilitation caused by widespread Norwegian scabies mite infection, which is regarded as a treatable condition. \"Significantly, the fact that Debbie had Down's Syndrome, a learning disability, made it more likely that her mother would be able to persuade others she was providing an acceptable level of care for Debbie.\"",
    "Smart meters enable people to monitor their electricity and gas use\n\nThe way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told. The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers. The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills. The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC. In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers. But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies. It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d. The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan. By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed. As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.\n\nHartesh Battu says he has had six different smart meters and none of them have worked\n\nThe cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly. As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights. Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place. Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car. His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d\n\nWhen the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily. But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us. She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland. This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama. One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date. \u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.\n\nSmart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story? Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).\n\nEnergy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita. Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead. However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d. Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed. It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d. In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits. Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills. The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly. The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d. It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly in, the north. Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home.\n\nDo you use a smart energy meter?

    "Sir Keir Starmer has said he is \"very pleased\" MPs will get the chance to debate and vote on the issue of assisted dying. The prime minister confirmed his government would remain neutral on the subject and that his MPs would be given a free vote, rather than having to follow a party line. Asked how he would vote, Sir Keir said his views were \"pretty well known\" but that he would look at the details of the bill being proposed. In 2015, Sir Keir supported an assisted dying bill and last year told reporters: \"I personally do think there are grounds for changing the law\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, Labour MP Kim Leadbeater confirmed she would introduce a bill giving terminally ill people in England and Wales the right to choose to end their life. Leadbeater's bill has yet to be finalised but is likely to be similar to Lord Falconer's proposal which would give terminally ill adults with six months or fewer to get medical help to end their own lives. Assisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Assisted dying is generally used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves.\n\nBackbench MPs do not normally get time in Parliament for their bills to be debated, but the Spen Valley MP's proposal will be allotted space after she came first in a ballot. The bill is expected to be formally introduced in Parliament on 16 October, and a debate could take place within weeks. Even if it is approved at an initial vote, the bill would still be debated at further stages in the parliamentary process. It would also need to be agreed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, before becoming law. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former paralympian and crossbench peer in the House of Lords, said she had concerns \"about the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis\". However, broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has been calling for change, welcomed the bill, telling the BBC: \"All I\u2019m asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice. \"If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die. It\u2019s a choice.\" The Childline founder has lung cancer and last year said she had joined Dignitas, the assisted dying clinic in Switzerland.\n\nDame Esther Rantzen has called for the law to change\n\nAsked about the issue during a visit to Liverpool, Sir Keir said: \"I made a promise to Esther Rantzen before the election that we would provide time for a debate and vote, but that it will be a free vote, and obviously that opportunity has now arisen.\" He added: \"I'm very pleased... that I'm able to make good on that promise to Esther Rantzen.\" Asked by BBC North West Tonight if he would vote in favour of changing the law, Sir Keir said: \"I think my views are pretty well know. Obviously I\u2019ll look at the detail of whatever legislation is proposed. But the government will be neutral.\"\n\nIt is not easy to predict how MPs will vote on Leadbeater's bill. The last time MPs voted on the subject was nine years ago, and the make-up of the House of Commons has changed greatly since then. In 2015, MPs rejected a bill allowing some terminally ill adults to end their lives with medical supervision by 300 votes to 118. Sir Keir was among the MPs backing a change, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson all opposed the bill. Health Secretary Wes Streeting voted in favour in 2015 but is now understood to be \"conflicted\" on the subject. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Breakfast he would vote in favour of the assisted dying bill and described the current law as \"cruel\".",
    "Almost \u00a31bn in funding will go to delivering London-style buses across England as part of a massive Budget boost, the government has promised. The Department for Transport (DfT) has given more details on its plans for 2025 after announcing the funding last month. It has promised to deliver what it calls \"London-style\" services to every corner of the country, and said funding would be allocated based on levels of deprivation and population, instead of making areas compete for investment as it has in previous years. The DfT says Leicester, the Isle of Wight, Torbay, Southend, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough are set to receive \"unprecedented\" levels of funding.\n\nIn urban areas, some of the biggest allocations are being given to combined authorities representing South Yorkshire and the Liverpool City Region. In total, there will be \u00a3712m for local authorities to improve services, alongside a further \u00a3243m for bus operators. About 3.4 million people in England travel regularly by bus, making it the most commonly used mode of public transport. Local authorities in all English regions will be able to introduce new bus routes, make services more frequent and protect crucial routes, the DfT says. It added the money will allow more urban areas to maintain high levels of service. Meanwhile, rural communities and small towns will be able to offer more services. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the funding would \"vastly improve\" the reliability and frequency of services, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of the Buses Bill, which aims to give local transport authorities across England new powers to take control of bus services. Under the plans, local authorities would be allowed to introduce a London-style franchising system, meaning they can decide routes, timetables and fares, with operators bidding to run the services for a fixed fee. The government has also pledged to remove a ban on publicly owned bus companies. An extra \u00a3151m will also fund a cap in single bus fares outside London, which rose to \u00a33 last month, until the end of 2025. The Liberal Democrats have called for the government to U-turn on the decision to raise the cap, with the party saying it will hit both commuters and local businesses. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said on Friday: \"The fare cap increase is like a bus tax for people across the country, impacting bus users and commuters already struggling to make ends meet. \"MPs must be given a say on this bus fare hike on behalf of their constituents.\" Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Labour have chosen to increase bus fares by 50% in a further attack on rural communities, working people and pensioners. \"They didn\u2019t have the courage to tell people their plans in the election. This is another broken promise that raises costs on working people.\" But the DfT said the fare cap introduced by the previous Conservative government was due to expire at the end of 2024 and some fares would have soared unless it intervened. \u201cFares will only be allowed to increase with inflation in the normal way, and the \u00a33 bus fare cap will lead to savings of up to 80% on some routes, keeping bus tickets affordable across the country,\" it said.\n\u2022 None More bus services could come under control of councils",
    "Robert Jenrick has accepted the job of shadow justice secretary in Kemi Badenoch's senior team, the BBC understands. The new Tory leader is also expected to name Dame Priti Patel as her shadow foreign secretary and Mel Stride as her shadow chancellor. Dame Priti, Stride and Jenrick were all candidates against Badenoch in the Tory leadership race, with Badenoch beating Jenrick in the final round. By appointing not only former rivals but also figures from different wings of the party, Badenoch will be hoping to unite the Conservatives after a bruising election defeat.\n\nHowever, there was wrangling over which, if any, job Jenrick would take and during negotiations one Conservative source, not close to the leadership, told the BBC: \"Kemi just doesn\u2019t like Rob. She thinks his whole schtick about her and whether she has any policies has done her lasting damage with the right and with Reform voters. \"This is only likely to further unravel.\"\n\nThe pair clashed during the final weeks of the leadership campaign, with Jenrick accusing Badenoch of being \"disrespectful\" to Tory members by failing to set out policies. Badenoch said she would not have used that word and, defending her own approach, said she would not make a promise \"unless I know how I am going to deliver it\". However, following the conclusion of the contest the two candidates exchanged warm words. In her victory speech on Saturday, Badenoch praised Jenrick\u2019s \"energy and determination\", adding: \"You and I know that we don't actually disagree on very much, and I have no doubt that you have a key role to play in our party for many years to come.\" Jenrick in turn congratulated his opponent on her win and urged Conservatives to unite behind the new leader. On Monday, a friend of Jenrick's said: \"Rob thinks the party needs to come together and take the fight to Labour. \"Unity could not be more important. He\u2019s eager to expose Labour\u2019s dreadful record on law and order.\" A formal announcement of Badenoch's full shadow cabinet is expected before its first meeting on Tuesday. Former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott has been given the job of shadow education secretary, with Neil O'Brien appointed shadow education minister. Trott and O'Brien have already appeared in their new roles in the House of Commons at Education Questions. Nigel Huddleston and Lord Dominic Johnson have also been appointed as joint chairmen of the Conservative party, the BBC understands. It follows the appointment of Castle Point MP Dame Rebecca Harris as Tory chief whip on Sunday evening.\n\nThe new shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti, has represented the Essex constituency of Witham since 2010 and served in several government departments during the Conservatives\u2019 time in power. She was forced to resign as international development secretary in 2017 following unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials but was brought back into government by Boris Johnson, who gave her the senior role of home secretary. At the Home Office she started the Rwanda policy, which aimed to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats by deporting them to the East African country but was later scrapped by the new Labour government. A prominent Brexit supporter, she is seen as being on the right of the party. By contrast Stride comes more from the left. Like Dame Priti he joined Parliament in 2010, winning the constituency of Central Devon, and has served in several government departments. A close ally of Rishi Sunak, he was given the job of work and pensions secretary and during the general election was trusted to do frequent media appearances. On Sunday Badenoch told the BBC she thought taxes had been too high under Sunak but has now given one of his most prominent supporters the much sought-after role of shadow chancellor.\n\nLaura Trott served as chief secretary to the Treasury in the Sunak government\n\nNew shadow education secretary Laura Trott has been MP for Sevenoaks in Kent since 2019, and served as number two in the Treasury under Jeremy Hunt when he was chancellor. Neil O'Brien has been MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston since 2017 and was most recently a health minister. He resigned from Sunak's government in November 2023 and took a more critical stance on the then-prime minister from the backbenches. While Trott and Huddleston supported Badenoch in the leadership, O'Brien had supported her rival Jenrick. The current Labour government has 120 ministers, meaning the Tories may struggle to shadow all posts given they only have 121 MPs. Former Home Secretary and defeated leadership candidate James Cleverly last week ruled out serving in the shadow cabinet, telling the FT, external he had been \"liberated\" from 16 years on the political front line and was now \"not particularly in the mood to be boxed back into a narrow band again\". Former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, former Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, former Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell and former Environment Secretary Steve Barclay have also said they will return to the backbenches and not serve in the new shadow cabinet.",
    "Callum Tindal-Draper's family said they have been told their son died on 5 November\n\nA family has paid tribute to their son who has been killed in Ukraine, saying they \"begged him not to go\" but he wanted to help. Callum Tindal-Draper's family said they were informed by the 4th International Legion that the 22-year-old from Cornwall had been killed in action while the foreign volunteer platoon defended an observation point on 5 November. His father Steven Draper said the family were proud of their \"brave\" son, who had told them before going to Ukraine in June he knew the risks he would face and the chances of him coming home were slim. The Foreign Office said: \"We are aware that a British national has reportedly died in Ukraine and stand ready to assist the family in the UK.\"\n\nCallum Tindal-Draper's father Steven said his son wanted to 'stand up to bullies'\n\nForeign Office advice has urged people not to travel to Ukraine while the country is in conflict with Russia. Mr Draper said the family, who live in Gunnislake in Cornwall, had tried to convince his son not to travel out to Ukraine. However, he said once Mr Tindal-Draper had told them he was going out to help no matter what, the family fully supported him with the plan as they knew how passionate he was about it. \"We begged and begged and begged him not to go,\" Mr Draper said. \"But Callum said 'dad, I'm not frightened of bullies and what's going on in Ukraine is awful and someone needs to stand up for these people'.\"\n\nCallum Tindal-Draper's family said they were very proud of him\n\nHis mother Caroline Tindal said the family were all \"so proud\" of Mr Tindal-Draper, who had previously worked at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and as a carer in the community. She went out to visit her son in Ukraine in September and said she noticed he had matured as a person. \"It was such a transformation and he said to me 'mum, coming out here was the best thing that ever happened to me, I've found who I was meant to be',\" Ms Tindal said. \"He found who he was meant to be, he became that person and he lived it.\"\n\nShe added Mr Tindal-Draper's battalion had told the family in video messages and handwritten letters they held him in high-esteem and he was an inspiration to them in Ukraine. Ms Tindal said: \"When we found out he'd died, there was just this hole which I can't describe and it's always going to be there. \"But to know that they are saying he inspired them and they called him their little brother because he was the youngest one out there, they really were a family unit, and that is helping heal us and helping us get by. \"Already that hole I thought could not be mended is being filled with overwhelming love from his family out there and it means so much.\"\n\nSteven Draper and Caroline Tindal said Callum's comrades sent them handwritten notes to say what an inspiration their son was\n\nMr Draper said the hole left by his son's death was \"crushing\", but he was filling it with pride from listening to what his comrades had said to the family. He added: \"It's inspiring me to go out and think what can I do and how can I be as brave and courageous in the things that I do. \"I've got the bravest of the brave as a son as an inspiration and that's really powerful.\" Ms Tindal said the family have not had Mr Tindal-Draper's body back yet, but the family have plans to bury him in Ukraine. She said: \"He wanted to stay in Ukraine and live in Ukraine, so I think even if we had the body we would bury him in Ukraine - that's where he found his home.\"\n\nA tribute to Mr Tindal-Draper has also been paid by Duchy College, where he had been part of its Military and Protective Services Academy. In a Facebook post, external from the academy, Mr Tindal-Draper was described as a \"passionate, articulate and bright student\" who had a strong moral compass. \"He was well liked and respected by his peers, and was not one to shy away from causes he believed in and was instrumental in collecting the three minibus loads of equipment that the learners gathered when the war in Ukraine initially kicked off,\" the post said. \"Callum truly believed in his sense of duty and after working for the NHS after the course, decided it was his duty to help Ukraine and joined the International Legion of Ukraine in the summer.\" It added Mr Tindal-Draper would be commemorated during services being held on Sunday and Monday to mark Remembrance Day.",
    "Why are we building homes when so many are standing empty?\n\nIn an average working day, Claudia Bowring has to play the role of detective, estate agent, family mediator and, occasionally, grief counsellor. She\u2019s an empty homes officer for a borough council in the suburbs of Nottingham. There are just short of 700,000 empty and unfurnished homes in England, according to the most recent government figures, external. Of those, 261,471 are classed as \u201clong-term empty,\u201d meaning no-one has lived there for six months or more. If all empty homes were brought back into use, the housing crisis would be solved at a stroke and, arguably, the government would not have to build 1.5m new homes. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not as simple as that. Bringing derelict and abandoned properties back to life can be a long and complex process. Even finding out who owns properties that have been standing empty for years, or in some cases decades, can be a challenge. Ms Bowring regularly uses a genealogist to track down the owners of long-abandoned houses on her patch in Rushcliffe. They are not always happy to be reminded of their responsibilities. \u201cIn some cases, people don\u2019t really understand the seriousness of their property being empty,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think \u2018well, it\u2019s my house, there is nothing the council can say or do to make me change my mind.\u2019\u201d Often homes become empty when the owners pass away, leading to a long administrative process known as probate, when their assets are divided up. Once that has been settled, families can still be reluctant to part with a property. Claudia Bowring is facing this problem with one of the houses on her patch. \u201cThe children have grown up there, their mum\u2019s died and left them the house, and emotionally they feel quite attached to the property, and me suggesting they should get rid of it or have it for rental is quite difficult to hear. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see someone else living in the property. They\u2019ve got trees that they planted in the garden when they were children, and they don\u2019t want someone coming in and ripping those up.\u201d When persuasion fails, the gloves come off.\n\nLike many local authorities, Conservative-controlled Rushcliffe charges extra council tax on homes that have been unoccupied for more than a year, under the Empty Homes Premium brought in by the previous government. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, the council can take enforcement action. It treats abandoned properties as an environmental health issue - derelict properties can be a magnet for vandalism and vermin, harming the quality of life for people living next to them. In some cases, the council is able to carry out emergency repair work on abandoned homes, and then force a sale at auction to recover its costs. This sometimes results in a windfall for the owners who were so reluctant to sell up in the first place. Another tool at the council\u2019s disposal are Empty Dwelling Management Orders, which give councils the right to take over and make repairs to run-down private properties that have been vacant for at least two years. They can rent the property out for up to seven years to recover costs.\n\nClaudia Bowring keeps an eye out for homes that can be brought back to life\n\nRushcliffe has used these tools and others to bring a modest but steady flow of properties back into use since it started taking the issue seriously in 2019. But it does not have to do this. There is no legal requirement for local authorities to bring empty homes back into use \u2013 and some councils choose not to. Rushcliffe is motivated by a desire to improve the quality of life for its residents and ease the housing shortage. But unlike many councils around the country, it is not in financial trouble \u2013 and does not have a serious homelessness problem. For some hard-pressed authorities \u201cempty homes work is a luxury,\u201d says housing expert Adam Cliff. \u201cIt is not against the law to own an empty property,\u201d he adds, and \u201cdifferent councils have different priorities\u201d. As secretary of professional support group the Empty Homes Network, he wants to raise the profile of empty homes among the public and politicians, as an alternative to building on the green belt land. He argues that there needs to be a central government programme, with a \u201cpot of money for councils to dip into as and when they need money to carry out enforcement,\u201d along the lines of a scheme operated by the Welsh government.\n\nAbandoned homes can be a blight on the neighbourhood\n\nProbate law needs to be reformed to prevent properties \u201csitting empty in perpetuity,\u201d he adds, but above all he believes empty homes need to be put back in the spotlight as a national issue. Campaign group Shelter is also concerned about the growing number of privately-owned empty properties, even if its main focus is on getting more social-rented homes built. Chief executive Polly Neate said: \u201cWe desperately need more genuinely affordable social homes and if the government is serious about its commitment to deliver them, it must do more to bring long-term empty homes back into use. \u201cConverting empty homes is not the silver bullet to ending the housing emergency, but it offers a cost-effective and green way to get more social rent homes built.\u201d Last year, Shelter produced a 10-city plan to rapidly convert 10,500 empty homes, external in the first three years of a new government. But the issue was rarely mentioned during the general election campaign, with only the Green Party putting it in their manifesto. And so far, there are few signs the Labour government regards it as a priority. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"Councils have a range of tools at their disposal to bring empty homes back into use, including charging additional council tax on vacant properties. \u201cWe are committed to building 1.5 million homes and delivering the biggest increase in social and affordable housing in a generation. This will unlock thousands of homes and make the dream of homeownership a reality for more people across the country.\u201d People working with empty homes all seem to have a strong sense of vocation. Adam Cliff said he first got interested in the issue as a teenager, and wrote his university dissertation on it. Claudia Bowring talks about the satisfaction she gets from putting life back into \u201cdead properties\u201d. But with little apparent interest from central government, and council budgets being squeezed, they are unlikely to be joined by new colleagues in the field any time soon.",
    "The Roman archaeological site of Pompeii will limit the number of daily visitors to the site to 20,000 a day after a steep rise in visitors. A record high 36,000 tourists visited the site on the first Sunday of October, when entry was free, local media reported. The park\u2019s management said on Friday that the site would cap its daily visitor number from 15 November. Pompeii, the ancient city buried in an eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in AD79, is one of the best-preserved Roman sites anywhere in the world.\n\nPompeii and its Roman inhabitants were buried in a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius\n\nNearly four million people, external visited the main Pompeii site in 2023, a third more than the previous year. Visitor counts had been climbing in the run up to the pandemic and in 2023 were above pre-Covid levels. In October 2024, there were more than 480,000 visitors, putting the average at about 15,500 a day. The busiest month so far this year was May, when about 517,000 people visited, or some 16,700 a day. The 20,000 cap is likely to only lead to tourists being turned away on a handful of occasions. A spokesperson for the park told Reuters that it had only exceeded 20,000 visitors when entry is free on the first Sunday of the month, as well as three or four fee-paying days.\n\nNearly 4 million people visited the main Pompeii site in 2023, a third more than the previous year\n\nGabriel Zuchtriegel, the park's director, said that reducing the effects of human visitors at Pompeii was important for conservation and safety reasons. The city was devastated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which preserved swathes of it almost intact under a layer of ash for over 1,000 years. About a third of the site has yet to be excavated. It continues to be of huge interest to archaeologists, providing the most complete picture of daily Roman life anywhere in the world. Earlier this year, archaeologists revealed frescos of mythical Greek figures including Helen of Troy and Apollo. The artworks were found in a banqueting hall with dramatic black walls and a mosaic floor made of more than 1 million white tiles.",
    "Workers have been warned their pay will be hit by Budget tax rises aimed at employers. Firms will bear the brunt of the Budget's \u00a340bn total tax rise due to an increase in the National Insurance rate for employers as well as a reduction in the threshold at which they start paying it. Businesses are likely to respond by holding back on pay rises, influential think tanks, the government's independent forecaster and the chancellor herself have all said. \"It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been,\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC.\n\nJames Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank which aims to improve living standards for low-to-middle income families, agreed. \"Even if it doesn't show up in pay packets from day one, it will eventually feed through to lower wages,\" he said. \"This is definitely a tax on working people, let's be very clear about that.\"\n\nOther Budget measures, including a big boost to spending on public services are expected to raise inflation in the short term, which could prevent interest rates falling more quickly. That will also have a knock-on effect on people's spending power. The government has pledged to make economic growth its priority and said people would have more \"pounds in their pockets\" by the end of the parliament. In its general election manifesto, Labour promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\" - explicitly ruling out a rise in VAT, National Insurance or income tax. The pledge has come under scrutiny, with some claiming that Labour have broken it with the rise in employer's National Insurance Contributions (NICs), something the government has denied. The Budget has sparked a debate over how much of the tax rise firms can absorb. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that by 2026-27, some 76% of the total cost of the NICs increase will be passed on through a squeeze on workers' pay rises and increased prices. The OBR expects that as a result of the Budget, average household income - which includes the impact of tax changes directly and indirectly, and benefits - will increase only slowly over the parliament.\n\nHowever, projected income growth is slightly faster than the 0.3% annual average between 2019 and 2024, a period which saw a series of economic blows including Brexit, the pandemic and energy price rises following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The effect of an ageing population is also putting more stress on public finances, especially through higher demand for health services. By 2028 real weekly wages - with price rises taken into account - will have grown by just \u00a313 over the past two decades, according to the Resolution Foundation.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the rise in employer NICs will affect larger firms hiring people on low wages the most, and could lead to fewer minimum wage jobs being available in future. It also warned that lower pay rises could mean the measure raises significantly less than a forecast \u00a325bn. It highlighted a forecast by the OBR that it could end up raising \"just\" \u00a316bn if, for example, businesses award smaller wage rises. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, also warned of likely further spending and tax increases part way through the parliament. He accused the chancellor of playing the \"same silly games\" as previous governments by \"pencilling in implausibly low spending increases for the future in order to make the fiscal arithmetic balance\". \"I suspect we\u2019ll end up with even more spending, possibly considerably more spending than is currently planned,\" he said. \"That will probably mean, unless she gets lucky with growth, more tax rises to come next year or the year after.\" Economic forecasts published by the OBR alongside the Budget suggest UK growth will pick up over the next two years, but then fall back to a more moderate pace, in large part due to Budget measures that are likely to push up prices and interest rates. Mr Johnson described the forecasts as \"pretty awful\".\n\nThe Resolution Foundation also warned that the decision to frontload increases to spending on public services into this year and next means the Spending Review in the Spring will be tough. Reeves has also left herself with a \"relatively slim margin of headroom\", it said. The chancellor's new debt rule allows more room for manoeuvre but most of that money has already been used up, which means that even a small economic downturn could force the government to increase taxes further in the future, the think tank said. Opposition parties were quick to criticise Reeves, with shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying she had taken the \u201ceasy route\u201d by \u201cpicking the pockets of businesses\u201d to fund public spending. He said the strategy would lead to \u201clower growth, lower living standards, lower wages, businesses employing fewer people. \u201cIt\u2019s businesses paying their taxes that pay for our public services and what we did not hear yesterday is a plan to grow the economy and that is what we need,\u201d he said. Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey said the chancellor was repeating the mistakes of her Conservative predecessors. \u201cRaising employer\u2019s National Insurance is a tax on jobs and High Streets, and it will make the health and care crisis worse by hitting thousands of small care providers,\u201d he said. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, said his government had taken a \"responsible\" approach in order to \"fix the foundations\" of the economy.",
    "Kat Booker said she felt told what to do, instead of being given neutral information during her pregnancy with Nancy\n\nA mum whose daughter has Down's syndrome said she felt \"pushed towards termination\" during her pregnancy. Kat Booker, 42, said information about her daughter Nancy's condition was \"very negative\" and made her feel \"horrendous\". Charity group Seren Dwt said language used in pregnancy could have a \"massive impact\" on experience. Antenatal Screening Wales said it was important information was offered in an \"unbiased and non-judgemental way\".\n\nMs Booker, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she felt she was being told what to do throughout her pregnancy, rather than being given information neutrally. \"I felt like I was being pushed towards termination, because it was the easier thing to do,\" she said. \"I was just being told how difficult everything was going to be and all the things that Nancy quite possibly wouldn\u2019t do, but not being given any other information as in there are children living quite happily with Down's syndrome.\"\n\nKat Booker said she had no doubts about her decision to carry on with her pregnancy\n\nShe said Nancy, four, was a \"dream\" who \"wears her out in the most fun way possible\". Born during the Covid-19 pandemic, she remembered being alone at appointments, needing more support. \"I couldn\u2019t really compute what was going on,\" she said. \"It was only after I left, and I was thinking about it, I got really quite angry about the way that I\u2019d been spoken to.\"\n\nOther mums of children with Down's syndrome said they had similar experiences. Laura Howard, mum to \"cheeky and feisty\" Tomos, four, said receiving his diagnosis after he was born felt \"very much like a bereavement situation\". \"We had a nurse coming in and being quite upset, saying 'oh, you\u2019re too nice a people to have this happen to you',\" she said. \"It\u2019s from good intentions that they\u2019re trying to say that, but it is still creating this whole negative situation around what is just a baby first and foremost.\"\n\nLaura Howard, Laura Thomas and Lou Kennedy (far right) set up a charity after their experiences of having babies with Down's syndrome\n\nAlong with two other mums - Lou Kennedy and Laura Thomas - she set up Seren Dwt, a charitable organisation gifting Welcome Boxes to babies with Down's syndrome across Wales. \"Having these boxes is saying there is a support group for you,\" Ms Howard said. \"You are not alone, and your child will be alright, there\u2019s lovely, positive things that they can achieve and there is a community ready and waiting with open arms for you.\" All three agreed language was incredibly important. \u201cI wish I could go back and tell myself two hours after she was born, when we realised, that you\u2019re going to be OK and she\u2019s going to be OK and life is not going to be doom and gloom,\u201d said Ms Kennedy.\n\nThe welcome boxes, which include knitted hats, cuddly toys and biscuits, are given as gifts to celebrate babies with Down's syndrome\n\nThe organisation provides the policies, standards, and framework to enable maternity services across Wales to provide screening tests, usually ultrasounds or blood tests, for those who choose to have them. She said their role was to ensure information was \"robust\" and \"evidence-based\", offered in an unbiased and non-judgmental way. \"For example, we would use language like 'probability' or 'chance'. We would not use the term 'risk'.\n\nSarah Fox says unbiased information should be given to expectant parents\n\n\"We would talk about 'conditions' not 'diseases',\" she explained. Ms Fox said they trained all student midwives around how to verbally offer screening tests, as well as providing written information in different formats. It is just one part of the entire maternity care system, but she said she understood the need to listen to feedback. \"We are up for the challenge. \"We want to consistently improve and make better training and collaborate more closely with maternity services and with families to make sure that the training is fit for purpose, and the information is fit for purpose to enable that unbiased, informed choice.\"\n\nGareth Thomas, a sociologist at Cardiff University University, has done extensive research with healthcare professionals, and written a book about the language around disability in pregnancy and antenatal care. He said he wanted to see \"why we're so invested in screening and how it affects healthcare professionals, as well as expectant parents\". He said it was simplistic and offensive to blame staff, when so many are \"conscientious\" and the \"victims of various pressures, not least time\". His research from 2017 found the term \"risk\" was being used in clinics, which might suggest how deeply ingrained that discourse around disability is, in systems and society.",
    "Bradley Nelson was left with disabilities, after being shaken by his dad as a baby\n\nA boy left blind and brain-damaged after being attacked as a baby by his father has died in hospital, prompting a fresh police investigation. Bradley Nelson, nine, was left severely disabled and unable to walk after being assaulted by Darren Spreadbury in April 2016, when he was seven months old. Despite being born \"fit and well\" Bradley was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Nearly nine years later, Bradley, from Whitby, died at Scarborough General Hospital last month after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn May 2018, Spreadbury was sentenced to four years in prison, after scans found Bradley\u2019s brain injuries had been caused by shaken baby syndrome. \"Bradley was blind because he shook him that hard, he snapped his optic nerve and he had a can of Coke\u2019s worth of blood between his brain and his skull,\" Bradley's mum, Sharon Boocock, said. Doctors later determined he had suffered a brain injury that was \"unexplained and non-accidental\", leading to the arrest of Spreadbury. He pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was handed a 10-year restraining order, as well as being sent to prison.\n\nBradley underwent several operations in the years following the attack\n\nIn the years following the attack, Bradley needed \"24-hour care\" and was unable to walk, talk or feed himself, according to his mum. He underwent several operations and suffered complications and infections. Ms Boocock said her life at the time was devoted to staying in to look after Bradley. \"I couldn\u2019t go anywhere after 17:00 because Bradley would come home from school and that was me housebound,\" she said. She explained how she had juggled her job as a bartender to earn \"whatever money she could\" and said she was \"learning to live again\". Last month, Bradley was sent home from school after complaining about feeling sleepy. He was taken in to hospital and Ms Boocock and her partner, Jonny Nelson, were told he had suffered a seizure after falling unconscious. Bradley died on 22 October after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nBradley was described by his mum as \"always smiling and happy\"\n\nSharon said, despite everything, Bradley had been \"always smiling and happy\". Last week, police informed her they were investigating the cause of his death. A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: \"We have been made aware of the death of a nine-year-old boy from the Whitby area, who sadly passed away in hospital on October 22. \"The child had complex medical needs and an investigation into the cause of his death is currently under way, reflecting due process in such circumstances.\" A fundraiser has been launched on GoFundMe by Sharon\u2019s friends to help cover Bradley\u2019s funeral costs.

    "Janette Ward consults a paper timetable at her bus stop - she says the tracking app can be unreliable\n\nThe 12:40 bus has just driven past Janette Ward\u2019s stop seven minutes early as she watches from the other side of the road, waiting to cross. There won\u2019t be another for two hours. \u201cIt makes it very difficult when you\u2019re going for an appointment or you\u2019re connecting to a rail service or other bus service,\u201d says Ms Ward, 74. There\u2019s also been further changes to make her journey more complicated, she says. Janette now has to take four buses to see her daughter in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Before, she only needed to change buses once. Her situation is by no means unique. The frequency of rural bus services in England has reached a historic low, according to a report by the County Councils Network. They found more than a quarter of rural routes had been lost over the decade to 2023.\n\nAnd last week's UK Budget revealed that the \u00a32 cap on bus fares in much of England will increase by \u00a31. It could mean an extra \u00a340 a month for someone who gets a return five days a week. Since then dozens of people have got in touch with BBC News, many saying that buses remain fundamentally unreliable. Some passengers say there's a lack of digital screens at bus stops and live app updates for some routes outside of cities, unlike trains and Ubers where many are used to tracking journeys in real time.\n\u2022 None What issues really matter to you? Let us know\n\nAnd even where tracking exists, it can sometimes be out of date. Take Leeds, for example, where some locals claim they've had to endure \u201cghost buses\u201d - they\u2019re advertised as coming on live displays at bus stops, but never do. \u201cFor people who rely on the bus as their only means of getting to work it\u2019s impossibly frustrating,\u201d says Cllr Eleanor Thomson, who runs a Facebook group for bus passengers in the Yorkshire city. \u201cSome people in the area have moved because they\u2019re that fed up of it, or they\u2019ve bought a car, which is costing them a lot of money.\u201d Bus operators told the local authority in January they\u2019re installing 4G technology to improve tracking, but Cllr Thomson says it \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be getting any better\u201d.\n\nJanette Ward relies on her local bus to see her daughter and go to appointments\n\nJanette has similar experiences of unreliable service updates in Hereford. \u201cOn bank holidays, sometimes the tracking service doesn\u2019t know if a bus is coming at all,\u201d she says. Campaigners think bringing the entire bus network into the 21st Century would give people more confidence in the service and make them more likely to use it. \u201cIf you know that your bus is coming in five minutes, then you know you have that certainty,\u201d says Silviya Barrett, director of policy and research from the Campaign for Better Transport. \u201cWhereas in some bus stops there isn't even the basic timetable, let alone the live arrival updates.\u201d\n\nDoreen Gower, who doesn\u2019t drive, uses the bus regularly to attend hospital appointments in Hereford. Now that her service only runs once every two hours, she feels she sometimes has to find alternatives because of the inconvenience. \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling very well, you don\u2019t particularly want to have to wait for another two hours for a bus. It means that I maybe have to pay \u00a325 for a taxi to get me home,\u201d she tells us. She also relies on volunteers, who provide a ring-and-ride service, to bring her to and from her local GP surgery in a neighbouring village around 20 minutes away.\n\nAs well as passengers, poor rural bus services are costing employers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty grim, some businesses are completely cut off from public transport,\u201d says Natalie Fryer, who has been appointed by Cumbria\u2019s tourism board to improve the situation. \u201cEmployees are walking down dark roads from their closest bus stops or train stations, with employers concerned for their safety. Some businesses say they put up staff in their own homes just so they can stay open.\u201d In an attempt to work around the problem, Gilpin Hotel, which lies in the heart of the Lake District, spends \u00a38,000 per month on taxis bringing some of its 137 staff to and from work. Many don't drive, a common occurrence in the hospitality sector. Helen Tappenden, who oversees personnel at the hotel, says the business has to \"put our hand in our pocket\" to avoid recruitment and retention problems. \u201cFor our staff it can feel very isolating because, while they might love working here, without a bus route they struggle to have some normality - like popping to a coffee shop or a cinema,\" she tells the BBC. And 40 miles away at Muncaster Castle - which is popular with visitors and wedding guests - Ewan Frost-Pennington lets some staff stay in a house on the grounds because of the lack of transport connections. \"That's got six young people living in it, of which I think two can drive,\" says Ewan, whose family have lived in the castle for 800 years.\n\nEwan Frost-Pennington provides staff housing to help keep Muncaster Castle running\n\nThe UK Government insists it recognises the current service offered by bus operators is unsatisfactory for many passengers - particularly in rural areas and it will introduce a new law to address that. Officials say the forthcoming buses bill will allow councils in England to deliver better services as they could choose to take control of them. Under this franchising system, councils could be able to decide routes, timetables and fares - with operators bidding to run services for a fixed fee. In London and Greater Manchester, where this system is active, bus fares will remain capped at \u00a31.75 and \u00a32 respectively after the new England-wide cap rise - and some passengers told the BBC they felt this risked widening regional inequality. But experts warn this kind of system is not suitable for all communities and that it works best when a council area includes both urban and rural parts.\n\nCampaign for Better Transport Silviya Barrett says some councils may choose not to run bus services as they don't have the expertise\n\n\u201cThe benefit is that if you have both of these, the more profitable ones in urban areas can pay for the services in rural areas,\u201d says Silviya. She adds that another reason why some councils may choose not to operate a franchised bus system is that they no longer have the expertise. \u201dThey haven't managed buses to this extent since privatisation,\u201d she says. In 1986, services outside of London were deregulated and privatised. Before then most bus services were operated by publicly owned companies, which were often run by councils. Some experts say bus services would also be made better if the way they are funded was made simpler - as currently there are six separate pots councils can apply to for money. \u201cStreamlining bus funding into a single, long-term pot would give councils greater control over services and spending and residents more long-term certainty over future services,\" says Cllr Adam Hug, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association.\n\nA bus belonging to DRM who operate the service in Herefordshire used by Janette and Doreen\n\nGraham Vidler, from the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus operators, tells us: \"We accept that passengers face a mixed picture depending on where they live.\" He said better technology at bus stops was the responsibility of local councils but that many would struggle to find the money to upgrade them given their tight budgets and the fact there are so many. \"In contrast to the rail network, where there is a manageable number of stations, there are tens and tens of thousands of bus stops across the country.\" Louis Dyson, managing director of DRM Buses, which operates the route in Herefordshire that Janette and Doreen use, says the company had cut the route from hourly to two-hourly because of a drop in passenger numbers. \u201cIf as much funding was given to support rural services, rather than making city buses run every 15 minutes, then perhaps there would be more options for the public,\u201d he says. Dyson says that when buses were running late it was usually caused by bad traffic, roadworks, bad weather and a lack of bus lanes - factors outside of drivers\u2019 control. And in response to claims that passengers can\u2019t always view accurate information about when DRM\u2019s buses are arriving, he says vehicles have ticket machine tracking software but that the rural location of services interfered with their connectivity. Dyson says the service that Janette and Doreen regularly take would be changing to hourly \u201cin the next month or two\u201d if it gets approval from officials. For people like Janette and Doreen, that can\u2019t come soon enough. For them buses are what give them their independence and a chance to see family and friends. \u201cWe\u2019re only asking for the service we had before to be reinstated,\u201d says Janette. \u201cNothing more.\u201d",
    "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s return to the White House is set to reshape US foreign policy, promising potentially radical shifts on multiple fronts as war and uncertainty grip parts of the world. During his campaign, Trump made broad policy pledges, often lacking specific details, based on principles of non-interventionism and trade protectionism - or as he puts it \u201cAmerica First\u201d. His victory signals one of the most significant potential disruptions in many years in Washington\u2019s approach to foreign affairs in the midst of parallel crises. We can piece together some of his likely approach to different areas from both his comments on the campaign trail and his track record in office from 2017 to 2021.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d. When asked how, he suggested overseeing a deal, but has declined to give specifics. A research paper written by two of Trump\u2019s former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s much-wanted entry into Nato. The former advisers said Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, who accuse him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, say his approach amounts to surrender for Ukraine and will endanger all of Europe. He has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far the former advisers\u2019 paper represents Trump\u2019s own thinking, but it\u2019s likely to give us a guide to the kind of advice he\u2019ll get. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to ending the war also extends to the strategic issue of the future of Nato, the transatlantic all-for-one and one-for-all military alliance set up after the World War Two, originally as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.\n\nNato now counts 32 countries and Trump has long been a sceptic of the alliance, accusing Europe of free-riding on America\u2019s promise of protection. Whether he would actually withdraw the US from Nato, which would signal the most significant shift in transatlantic defence relations in nearly a century, remains a matter of debate. Some of his allies suggest his hard line is just a negotiating tactic to get members to meet the alliance\u2019s defence spending guidelines. But the reality is Nato leaders will be seriously worried about what his victory means for the alliance\u2019s future and how its deterrent effect is perceived by hostile leaders.\n\nAs with Ukraine, Trump has promised to bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East - implying he would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon - but has not said how. He has repeatedly said that, if he had been in power rather than Joe Biden, Hamas would not have attacked Israel because of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran, which funds the group. Broadly, it\u2019s likely Trump would attempt to return to the policy, which saw his administration pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, apply greater sanctions against Iran and kill Gen Qasem Soleimani - Iran\u2019s most powerful military commander. In the White House, Trump enacted strongly pro-Israel policies, naming Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv - a move which energised Trump\u2019s Christian evangelical base, a core Republican voter group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \u201cbest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. But critics argue his policy had a destabilising effect on the region. The Palestinians boycotted the Trump administration, because of Washington\u2019s abandonment of their claim to Jerusalem - the city that forms the historical centre of national and religious life for Palestinians. They were further isolated when Trump brokered the so-called \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d, which saw a historic deal to normalise diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries. They did so without Israel having to accept a future independent Palestinian state alongside it - the so-called two-state solution - previously a condition of Arab countries for such a regional deal. The countries involved were instead given access to advanced US weapons in return for recognising Israel. The Palestinians were left at one of the most isolated points in their history by the only power that can really apply leverage to both sides in the conflict - further eroding their ability as they saw it to protect themselves on the ground. Trump made several statements during the campaign saying he wants the Gaza war to end. He has had a complex, at times dysfunctional relationship with Netanyahu, but certainly has the ability to apply pressure on him. He also has a history of strong relations with leaders in the key Arab countries that have contacts with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear how he would navigate between his desire to show strong support for the Israeli leadership while also trying to bring the war to a close. Trump\u2019s allies have often portrayed his unpredictability as a diplomatic asset, but in the highly contested and volatile Middle East in the midst of a crisis already of historical proportions, it\u2019s far from clear how this would play out. Trump will have to decide how - or whether - to take forward the stalled diplomatic process launched by the Biden administration to get a Gaza ceasefire in return for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAmerica\u2019s approach to China is its most strategically important area of foreign policy - and one which has the biggest implications for global security and trade. When he was in office, Trump labelled China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and imposed tariffs on some Chinese imports to the US. This sparked tit-for-tat tariffs by Beijing on American imports. There were efforts to de-escalate the trade dispute, but the Covid pandemic wiped out this possibility, and relations got worse as the former president labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. While the Biden administration claimed to take a more responsible approach to China policy, it did, in fact, keep in place many of the Trump-era tariffs on imports.\n\u2022 None What Chinese people want from the US The trade policy has become closely linked to domestic voter perceptions in the US about protecting American manufacturing jobs - even though much of the long-term jobs decline in traditional US industries like steel has been as much about factory automation and production changes as global competition and offshoring. Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as both \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d and a highly effective leader who controls 1.4 billion people with an \u201ciron fist\u201d- part of what opponents characterised as Trump\u2019s admiration for \u201cdictators\u201d. The former president seems likely to shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s approach of building stronger US security partnerships with other regional countries in a bid to contain China. The US has maintained military assistance for self-ruled Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing\u2019s control. Trump said in October that if he returned to the White House, he would not have to use military force to prevent a Chinese blockade of Taiwan because President Xi knew he was \u201c[expletive] crazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",

    "Badgers are mainly nocturnal animals and dig setts underground that can extend some distance\n\nBadgers tunnelling under a road in Lincolnshire have caused \u00a3100,000 worth of damage, a council has said. The mammals had dug a sett under the A52 at Seaholme Road, in the middle of Mablethorpe, according to Lincolnshire County Council. Emergency repairs to the road would have to be carried out to stop it falling apart, a spokesperson for the authority said. However, the council had had to wait for a licence from Natural England before the work could be carried out because badgers were a protected species, they added.\n\nThe authority had wanted to carry out the repairs earlier, but now the licence had been granted, it was running out of time to do the emergency work, according to the spokesperson. All work on badger setts must be completed between July and the end of November so the repairs did not interfere with the badgers' mating season, they explained.\n\nSeaholme Road joins the A52 which runs along the seafront at Mablethorpe\n\nCouncillor Richard Davies said: \u201cIn total, these works are going to cost us an additional \u00a3100,000 to complete.\u201d The Mablethorpe area already has road closures on the A1104 for resurfacing work, and Davies said the authority was aware of traffic flow issues in the town. The A1104 scheme could not be paused as it was at a critical point, he said. \u201cOur hands are tied about scheduling these conflicting works,\" Davies explained. \"We have no option but to get this additional programme up and running straight away. \"If there was any other option available to us, we\u2019d take it.\" Davies added that it was \"extremely frustrating we have not been given this licence until now\". The council spokesperson said the work would be carried out between 09:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT from Saturday 8 November and Wednesday 20 November. A three-way traffic light system would operate outside those hours so the road could be used. Natural England has been approached for a comment.

    "Primark owner Associated British Foods (ABF) has said the recent Budget may lead it to invest more outside the UK over fears the High Street will bear the \"weight of tax rises\". George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: \"We\u2019re an international business as well, we have choices about where we will invest.\" It comes as the owner of the fast fashion brand reported a 43% rise in profits before tax, reaching \u00a31.9bn over the year to 14 September. It said \"challenging weather\" had hit the number of people visiting its shops between April and June, but expects a strong performance over Christmas.\n\nFollowing its latest update to investors on Tuesday, the boss of ABF said it is preparing for a rise in costs after new measures were introduced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. During Labour's first Budget in 14 years, the chancellor set out changes including an increase in employers' national insurance (NI) contributions. Mr Weston said they would see ABF's wage bill \"go up by tens of millions\". \"It's quite clear to me that this a Budget where the weight of the tax rises are falling on business - within that, it's fallen particularly on the high street,\" he added. During an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Ms Reeves said that she was not \"immune\" to the criticism her plans have received. She suggested that the money raised would help put public finances on a \"firm footing\". The decision to increase NI contributions made by employers has come under fire from many businesses. Despite the prospect of rising costs, Mr Weston said in an interview with the PA News agency that there was \"no intention\" for Primark to raise its prices for the rest of year. Overall, Primark sales across the UK and Ireland grew by 0.7% in the year to 14 September, stripping out the effect of new shops opening. It said that sportswear, jumpers and pyjamas had done particularly well among its womenswear ranges.\n\nThe fashion giant said that it had seen a strong start to the sales of its autumn and winter ranges, despite wetter weather washing out those of summer shoes and beachwear. Primark saw a 6% growth in sales in the year overall and saw shirts and leisurewear items do well among men. It comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned of a \"disappointing\" October. The BRC suggested that shoppers were holding back on spending on bigger-ticket items until the \"Black Friday\" sales. Its latest figures suggest that total retail sales across the UK increased by 0.6% year-on-year in October, a drop against 2.6% seen in October 2023. \"This was part driven by half-term falling a week later this year, depressing the October figures, and November sales will likely see more of a boost,\" its chief executive Helen Dickinson OBE said. Ms Dickinson suggested that the Budget and rising energy bills might have \"spooked some consumers\" and blamed more mild weather recently for delaying winter purchases of items like coats and jackets. Elsewhere on Tuesday, online retail giant Asos reported mounting losses, reaching \u00a3393m in the year to 1 September. The group's turnaround plan has seen it reduce stock and launch clearance sales to shift old ranges. Chloe Collins, head of apparel at research firm GlobalData, suggested that the retailer has failed to \"combat the enormous threat\" from other companies include the likes of Shein, as well as the rise of second-hand clothing markets like Vinted. But Asos boss Jose Antonio Ramos Calamonte said there were some \"green shoots\" in the performance of its new clothes ranges in recent months. \"We will do things in the right way and we're going to be patient,\" he said.",
    "Seven new lawsuits filed against Sean 'Diddy' Combs\n\nSeven new civil lawsuits have been filed against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in a federal court in New York. Four men and three women accuse the hip-hop mogul of sexually assaulting them at various parties in Los Angeles, New York and Las Vegas. The youngest plaintiff was 13 at the time of the alleged incident. Mr Combs remains in custody at a Brooklyn jail. He is separately facing federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, which he denies. The BBC has approached his legal team for comment on the new cases.\n\nHis lawyers recently dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity\", stressing that \"Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman.\u201d All seven of the new civil cases allege that Mr Combs - or by proxy through his associates - drugged alcoholic beverages at the events that made the plaintiffs dizzy, nauseous and feel outside their bodies. In several of the suits, plaintiffs allege that Mr Combs raped them, forced oral sex on them, or aggressively groped them. Mr Combs is currently awaiting trial in May of next year for the federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. The hip-hop icon has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has been denied bail multiple times. The indictment, along with several lawsuits, implicates his various business enterprises, alleging they played a role in facilitating and funding his abusive actions both inside and outside the music industry. The lawsuits further accuse Mr Combs of leveraging his power and influence in entertainment to manipulate, intimidate, and silence those around him.\n\nOne new case alleges Mr Combs and another male celebrity raped a 13-year-old girl at an after-party for the 2000 VMAs. The second male celebrity is not named in the lawsuit. Another alleges Mr Combs drugged an independent musical artist at a party and raped her. She says she woke up in pain and with imprints on her arms suggesting she had been tied with ropes while she was unconscious. In a third case, Mr Combs allegedly exposed himself to a man, and then grabbed the man's genitals in a \"rough\" and \"sexual\" manner. A fourth involves a celebrity personal trainer, who Mr Combs allegedly assaulted at a party at his Hollywood Hills home in 2022. The trainer says he saw many high-profile celebrities engaging in group sexual activities at the party, where he was later brought into a small room with Mr Combs, who removed the personal trainer's pants and performed \"non-consensual oral sex onto him\". The fifth new filing concerns a woman who alleges she was drugged at a party at Mr Combs' hotel room and woke up naked in bed with the rap musician talking on the phone in the corner of the room. The sixth case involves a man who ran a security firm. He alleges that he was invited into a private room by Mr Combs at a party, and he was then given a drink that made him feel dizzy and nauseous. He claims that Mr Combs then stuck his hands in his pants and grabbed his genitals. The seventh case, as reported by US media, was a 17-year-old aspiring musician who alleges he was assaulted at a party by Mr Combs. Mr Combs has faced almost a year of allegations, ranging from rape and sexual assault to grooming and domestic violence. One lawyer recently said more than 100 clients plan to sue the musician for sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. He is currently in jail while he awaits his trial in New York. Prosecutors alleged that he also engaged in kidnapping, forced labour, bribery and other crimes. They described him as the head of a criminal enterprise that abused women, using threats of violence to force them into participating in drug-fuelled orgies with male prostitutes. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was denied bail. His trial is due to take place in May 2025.",
    "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, external and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US. Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad. Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\" But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy. Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering. Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.\n\nMr Adani, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire, is a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n\nIndia\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share), seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market). With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide. His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa. Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.) \u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.\n\nAdani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday\n\nThis crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI. \u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC. For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects. \"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"\n\nMr Adani has faced challenges in Kenya over a planned takeover of an international airport\n\nThe latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal. \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC. What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes. Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.\n\nOpposition leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded the arrest of Mr Adani\n\nWhile the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong. \u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says. Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says. \"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d",

    "Disability Wales chief executive Rhian Davies has also added her concerns about the cut in the winter fuel payments\n\nMore pensioners will die because of the decision to withdraw the winter fuel payment, Wales' older people's commissioner has said. Rhian Bowen-Davies said UK ministers needed to reverse the decision that will see 90% of pensioners between 66 and 79 lose the payment. The Labour-run UK government said cuts were necessary to address what it called the financial \"black hole\" it inherited from the Conservatives. \"People will feel the impact of this,\" said Ms Bowen-Davies. \"We know that this could impact on 4,000 additional deaths this winter.\"\n\nShelia Burgess from Magor, Monmouthshire, began working at 15 and thought she would be able to claim her state pension at 60, but was then caught out by government changes to the rules. She is one of the so-called Waspi women who were born in the 1950s and say they didn't have enough time to prepare for the fact that they would have to work years longer before being able to claim their state pension.\n\nMs Burgess is now expecting to lose the winter fuel payment, external which had been \"something that made us not have to worry if the weather got very cold\". \"I appreciate it's not a huge amount of money but that \u00a3300 during the winter months is a big help,\" she said. The UK government's own figures showed 83% of people over 80 would lose the payment, rising to 90% of those aged 66 to 79. Other groups will lose out too, with 71% of pensioners with disabilities having the payment taken away.\n\nRhian Bowen-Davies, the older people\u2019s commissioner for Wales, is warning that more people will die as a result of the winter fuel payment cut\n\nDisability Wales chief executive Rhian Davies said some people needed every penny. \"They need to have warm homes [and] perhaps because of vision impairment they'll need to have good lighting. They need to be running equipment,\" she said. \"Many disabled people of whatever age often have higher fuel costs and need to have greater use of electricity, heating, directly related to their impairment.\"\n\nCaerfyrddin MP Ann Davies highlighted concerns about one of her constituent losing the winter fuel payment during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions\n\nThe plight of Welsh pensioners was raised by Plaid Cymru's Caerfyrddin MP, Ann Davies, during Prime Minister's Questions, external when she highlighted the case of constituent, Janette Crawford, whom she said suffered with ME and chronic pain. \"The cold, damp conditions of a Welsh winter are going to mean a lot more muscle soreness and fatigue for her,\" she said. \"She has lost her winter fuel payments due to having a very small savings pot. \"With 86% of pensioners in poverty, or just above that line, to miss out in Wales, will the prime minister establish a social energy tariff to help people like Janette?\" Sir Keir Starmer said his government had \"inherited a \u00a322bn black hole\" and Conservative MPs \"should be apologising... for leaving the country in such a state\". He said government was committed to the pension \"triple lock\" which would increase by \u00a3460 next year. \"That means pensioners under Labour will be better off because we are going to stabilise the economy after that lot lost control of it,\" he said.\n\nPension expert Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said people who have lost the payment had options such as applying for pension credit. \"You can look to see if you can qualify for the warm home discount, external, which is a rebate of \u00a3150 off your fuel bills\u2026 if you are genuinely really struggling with these energy bills this winter, speak to your supplier and see if they can help you,\" she said. She does not think Chancellor Rachel Reeves will change course during this month's Budget but \"one thing that could perhaps happen is to maybe soften it around the edges a bit\". She said that could include some kind of support for people who \"don't quite qualify for pension credit\".\n\nConservative social justice spokesman Joel James said Labour ministers \"must listen to the stark warning\" by the commissioner. \"Tens of thousands of people from Wales alone have signed petitions calling on Labour to reverse this nonsensical decision,\" he said. \"There is still time to change course before the winter and give pensioners the reprieve they deserve - before it's too late.\"",
    "The government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since Labour won the general election. It is the week where farmers are heading for Westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them. Among those expected outside Parliament on Tuesday is the country\u2019s most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, Jeremy Clarkson. Guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.\n\nNearly three weeks on from the Budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing. There is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected. BBC Verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers. But beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors. Indeed, speaking on The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and the president of the Countryside Alliance, said the government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax relief \u201csmell of incompetence\u201d and that a \"large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community\". Two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from Sir Keir Starmer down that they are not going to change their minds. And secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows Labour had with many in rural Britain the last time it was in power. Twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central London to highlight the needs of rural communities. The initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting. As farmers head for Westminster, the prime minister has been heading for South America - he is at the G20 Summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies in Brazil for the next few days. But the issue followed him into the skies of the south Atlantic, where he said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the \u201cvast majority of farms and farmers\u201d would not be affected by the changes. \u201cIt's important for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d he said. The truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the Budget. I asked Sir Keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.\n\nSir Keir Starmer says supporting farmers is \"very important\"\n\nAsked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, Sir Keir said \u201cit's very important that we support farmers.\u201d He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside. \"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming. \"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union. Incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in England as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas. It shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don\u2019t handle this well. So why has this row become so noisy so quickly? From the conversations I have had, I think there are three main reasons.\n\nFirstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it. The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21. Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed. For others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone. Secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by The Economist magazine: \u201cNever pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children\u2019s book.\u201d Trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes. Think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food. Thirdly, I am told it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context. \u201cIt is the straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back,\u201d is how one farming source put it to me. There was the new trade deal with Australia, which many farmers think undermines them. There are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after Brexit. And there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. There have been five farming ministers in the last five years. Put them all together and there is a disillusion and a widespread sense among farmers of not being listened to. Westminster is certain to hear them this week.\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Cowboys, murderous revenge plots and family secrets have kept Yellowstone fans hooked since 2018. It is one of the most watched shows in the US and turned creator Taylor Sheridan into the king of prime time television. But last year, Paramount announced that the fifth season, which is due to end next month, would be the last. Its star, Kelly Reilly, tells me it will be \"an ending to the Yellowstone world we have known\". \"Does it mean it's the end of me playing her? Maybe, maybe not,\" she says. \"We don't know yet is the honest answer.\" There have already been two Yellowstone spin-offs, with more in the works. Reilly, who plays the troubled and volatile Beth Dutton, says she would \"love\" to keep playing her character, but any spin-off \"would be a new beginning somewhere\". It sounds like something is possibly in the works, though, with Reilly saying she \"can't talk about the future because there are so many conversations happening\".\n\nYellowstone's drama on screen has been mirrored off screen, with the departure of its leading man, Kevin Costner. He only filmed half of season five because of what he says were contract and scheduling issues, external. Sheridan has said, external it was down to Costner's wish to focus on his Horizon film series, which the star is directing, co-writing, producing and starring in. Either way, it leaves British-born Reilly as arguably the star of the show. The daughter of a police officer and a hospital receptionist, the actress was born and brought up in Chessington, Greater London. A far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nShe has previously starred in True Detective, Prime Suspect and Above Suspicion. But Yellowstone has introduced her to a huge international audience. I ask how it feels to be an in-demand leading lady. \"Well, I'm 47 years old, it hasn't happened overnight, you know. So it's not like I'm getting whiplash,\" she laughs. \"I have been a working actor for 30 years. It's not lost on me that there's a unicorn of shows that have such success worldwide and a character that has had this amount of attention or appeal. \"But I treat it at arm's length. I don't spend too much time thinking about it. I have a very normal life. It's very important to me that my life is normal. Nothing has changed, other than I'm really busy. \"I don't get to sleep at home very often, which is annoying because I love home!\"\n\nKelly Reilly with her on screen husband Cole Hauser\n\nMost fans assume Reilly is herself an American, not the softly spoken Brit she is in reality. She tells me that when Yellowstone started, she \"didn't do any press\" because she wanted people to believe in her character. \"People talk to me as if Beth is real,\" she says. \"We all talk about Beth like she's a real-life person. \"I'm always going to be a bit of a let down when people meet me. I go into the local bakery and the lady is like, 'I'd love to drink with you.' \"I know what she means - she wants to drink with Beth. People want to feel part of that energy... someone so connected with their primal self. \"And we're so disconnected. We're all on our phones, on social media. It is like it doesn't happen if someone doesn't take a picture of it. Beth is the opposite of that. She is just so alive.\" To say Reilly's character has been put through the wringer would be an understatement. Beth has survived attempted rape, attempted murder, crushing heartbreak and being betrayed by family members. She even exclaims: \"I am the rock therapists break themselves against.\" Reilly describes Beth as a \"powerhouse\", telling me it's been \"such a fun adventure to put her on\". \"I'm very introverted,\" she adds. \"I don't have any dreams of vengeance in my life. \"There\u2019s something really exciting about playing her. I feel like I\u2019m on an adrenaline rush for four months while I play her, and when I\u2019m finished I\u2019m like, I now have to go back to my quiet, boring life. And I'm very grateful for my quiet, boring life after I've played her. \"But by the time every summer comes around where I'm sort of gearing up again and the scripts start coming in, I get excited again to meet her. \"I'm very aware of the gift of her as a character, but I lock her up in a padlocked box for six months of the year.\"\n\nKelly Reilly on set on Yellowstone with Luke Grimes\n\nThe character of Beth quickly became a fan favourite, with articles devoted to getting her character's look, and thousands of social media posts about her. One of Beth's most memorable lines of dialogues, \"You are the trailer park, I am the tornado\", is even printed on T-shirts. What does Reilly put that popularity down to? \"She\u2019s unequivocally herself and unapologetic about that,\" she says. \"And as a woman, it is so refreshing and so much fun to play.\" The actress believes Beth \"has penetrated a zeitgeist in women specifically\". \"I think it is that unencumbered kind of freedom that she moves through the world with. She is not afraid of dying, she is not afraid of losing. \"There is a scene in season two where she is being attacked by a man who is in the process of raping her and is about to kill her and she is covered in blood. \"She will not be a victim to him. And I think for women and for me, I love that. She is fierce.\" After all the trauma her character has experienced, Reilly says she \"goes through different phases\" of considering what a happy ending would be for Beth. \"I trust Taylor and his vision for her. He loves her so much,\" she says. \"I would like something cathartic, potentially. I would hate to leave her out in the wilderness. But I don't know if happiness is something any of these characters strive for. \"They strive to protect, they strive to kill, they strive to be killed. These are not looking for peaceful lives.\" Yellowstone season five part two is on Paramount from Sunday, 10 November.",

    "There were more than 440,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March\n\nShoplifting is at \"unacceptable\" levels and not being tackled properly, a Lords inquiry has found. The crime is seriously under-reported and the problem is so urgent police forces need to take \"immediate action\", according to the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee. It says retailers need to be able to report crimes more easily, more funding is needed for offender rehabilitation, and regulations should be introduced to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods online anonymously. The Home Office said it was making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence and deploying \"thousands\" of police officers dedicated to tackling shoplifting.\n\nThe Lords committee held an inquiry into tackling shoplifting in which it heard evidence from police chiefs, retailers and industry experts in May and September. In a letter published today, it said there were more than 443,000 incidents of shop theft recorded by police in the year to March 2024 \u2013 the highest ever since records began 20 years ago. But they were \"a drop in the ocean\" when compared with likely real figures estimated at 17 million annually \u2013 which has \"devastating consequences for businesses and families\". Shop theft has evolved from \"individualised offending to relentless, large-scale, organised operations accompanied by unprecedented levels of violence\", it added. Tracey Robertson, co-owner of Paw Prints \u2013 a small chain of pet shops across Yorkshire \u2013 says shoplifting costs her business around \u00a38,000 a year. \"It\u2019s a financial impact on a family business. It\u2019s bad in the fact that it affects the staff that work for us because sometimes it\u2019s aggressive and violent,\" she said.\n\nTracey Robertson, who owns a small chain of pet shops in Yorkshire, says shoplifting costs her around \u00a38,000 a year\n\nThe committee supported schemes like Project Pegasus - a partnership between retailers and police to tackle organised shoplifting gangs - but said there needs to be a strategy to deal with local prolific offenders too. \"The scale of the shop theft problem within England and Wales is totally unacceptable and action, like that under way in the Pegasus scheme, is vital and urgent,\" said Lord Foster of Bath, chair of the committee. The committee found there is a widespread perception that shop theft is not treated seriously by the police which \"risks undermining confidence in the police and wider criminal justice system\". It said shoplifting cost the retail sector nearly \u00a32bn last year \u2013 which resulted in price rises impacting individuals, families and communities. \"We acknowledge the pressures on police resources, but we believe that the urgency of the situation relating to shop theft requires immediate action within existing police staffing levels,\" the letter said. It has made a series of recommendations to the government which it says would \"help tackle the problem and keep the public and our economy safer\".\n\u2022 None Phasing out the use of the outdated term \"shoplifting\" which serves to trivialise the severity of the offence\n\u2022 None Developing improved reporting systems to enable retailers to report crime to the police quickly and easily\n\u2022 None Introducing regulations to make it more difficult to sell stolen goods on online marketplaces anonymously\n\u2022 None Introducing regulations and best practice guidance for the use of facial recognition technology by private companies Shop owner Tracey Robertson believes the recommendations do not go far enough and wants to see much tougher sentences for repeat offenders. Professor of criminology Emmeline Taylor, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said the committee recommendations are \"far-reaching\" and understand the multiple root causes of shop theft. \"If adopted by the police, the industry and the government it will certainly do a huge amount to begin to turn the tide on the tsunami of shop theft that has impacted the retail sector across the UK.\"\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said it welcomed the report which further highlights the significant impact retail crime has on its victims. \"We are doing all we can to reduce thefts and pursue offenders, especially those prolific and habitual offenders, who cause misery within the community,\" said Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman, the NPCC\u2019s lead for acquisitive crime. The Home Office said it understands the \"devastating impact\" of shop theft has on communities. A spokesperson added: \"We are taking immediate action through our commitment to scrap the \u00a3200 shop theft threshold, and making assaults on shop workers a criminal offence. \"We will also put thousands more dedicated police officers on our streets, and establish a Retail Crime Forum for retailers to confidently implement tactics against shop theft.\"",
    "Trump ally says Ukraine focus must be peace, not territory\n\nTrump has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem the drain on US resources\n\nA former adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming administration will focus on achieving peace in Ukraine rather than enabling the country to gain back territory occupied by Russia. Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a \"realistic vision for peace\". \"And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious,\" he said. \"Crimea is gone.\" A spokesperson for Trump distanced the incoming president from the remarks, saying Mr Lanza \"does not speak for him\".\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Eight years later, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has occupied territory in the country's east. The president-elect has consistently said his priority is to end the war and stem what he characterises as a drain on US resources, in the form of military aid to Ukraine. But he has yet to divulge how he intends to do so - and will likely be hearing competing visions for Ukraine's future from his various advisers. Mr Lanza, a Trump political adviser during his 2016 and 2024 campaigns, did not mention areas of eastern Ukraine, but he said regaining Crimea from Russia was unrealistic and \"not the goal of the United States\". \"When Zelensky says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace once Crimea is returned, we've got news for President Zelensky: Crimea is gone,\" he told the BBC World Service\u2019s Weekend programme. \"And if that is your priority of getting Crimea back and having American soldiers fight to get Crimea back, you're on your own.\" The US has never deployed American soldiers to fight in Ukraine, nor has Kyiv requested American troops fight on its behalf. Ukraine has only requested American military aid to arm its own soldiers. Mr Lanza said he had tremendous respect for the Ukrainian people, whose \"hearts are made of lions\". But he said the US priority was \"peace and to stop the killing\". \"What we're going to say to Ukraine is, you know what you see? What do you see as a realistic vision for peace. It's not a vision for winning, but it's a vision for peace. And let's start having the honest conversation,\" he said. In response, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn characterised Mr Lanza's remarks as placing the pressure for peace on Ukraine when it was \"Putin who wants more war\". \"Putin loses most of his people in assaults at the front. What does this indicate? It is obvious that he wants to fight on,\" he said. \"Ukraine has been offering peace since 2022 - there are quite realistic proposals. And it is Russia that must be made to hear that peace is needed and that peace must be reliable, so that there is simply no repetition of Russian strikes.\" A spokesperson for Trump's transition team - which prepares the incoming administration for office - said Mr Lanza was \"a contractor for the campaign\", but \"does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him\". Trump is expected to handle peace talks with a close circle of aides once in office. An unnamed National Security Council aide who previously served under Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday: \"Anyone - no matter how senior in Trump\u2019s circle - who claims to have a different view or more detailed window into his plans on Ukraine simply doesn\u2019t know what he or she is talking about.\" They said that the former president \"makes his own calls on national security issues\" and had done so \"many times in the moment\". Trump spoke to Zelensky after his election win, with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part in the call.\n\nZelensky and Trump after a meeting in the US earlier this year - they spoke on the phone on Wednesday\n\nA source in Ukraine's presidential office told the BBC that the \"good lengthy conversation\" between Zelensky and Trump lasted \"about half an hour\". \u201cIt was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things, but overall it was very warm and pleasant.\u201d Trump's Democratic opponents have accused him of cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and say his approach to the war amounts to surrender for Ukraine that will endanger all of Europe. The prime minister of Estonia told the BBC that if Ukraine backs down from the conflict, \"Russia\u2019s appetite will only grow\". Kristen Michal told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"The question probably is that if you start giving up, then you should be prepared to give more. \"For Russia it\u2019s quite understandable that if you draw a line somewhere and use the force to back it up, they will back up too, but not by politeness, that\u2019s not the plan.\"\n\nLast month, Zelensky presented a \"victory plan\" to the Ukrainian parliament that included a refusal to cede Ukraine\u2019s territories and sovereignty. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \u201cin a day\u201d, but never gave further details. A paper written by two of his former national security chiefs in May said the US should continue supplying weapons, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia. Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting all of its territory back from Russian occupation, the paper said, but it should negotiate based on current front lines. Earlier this week, Putin congratulated Trump on his election victory and said Trump's claim that he can help end the war in Ukraine \"deserves attention at least\". Mr Lanza also criticised the support the Biden-Harris administration and European countries have given to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. \"The reality on the ground is [that] the European nation states and President Biden did not give Ukraine the ability and the arms to win this war at the very beginning and failed to lift the restrictions for Ukraine to win,\" he said. Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives approved a $61bn (\u00a349bn) package in military aid for Ukraine to help combat Russia's invasion. The US has been the biggest arms supplier to Ukraine - between February 2022 and the end of June 2024, it delivered or committed weapons and equipment worth $55.5bn (\u00a341.5bn), according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation. Clarification: This article has been amended to reflect that Bryan Lanza stopped working as an adviser to the Trump campaign after the election.",
    "Ben Earl scored his first try of England's Autumn Nation Series campaign\n\nEngland ended their five-match losing run with a nine-try hammering of Eddie Jones' Japan at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium. The victory marked a first and only win of a difficult Autumn Nation Series campaign for Steve Borthwick's side after close defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Captain Jamie George scored twice in a clinical opening period, which saw Ben Earl, Sam Underhill and Ollie Sleightholme also grab tries. The Brave Blossoms managed one eye-catching score in the first half through captain Naoto Saito. Full-back George Furbank gathered Tommy Freeman's sublime behind-the-back pass to score England's sixth try in the second half, before replacement hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie burrowed over the line for the first of his two tries. Flanker Kazuki Himeno's try gave Jones' side a deserved second-half score, but the hosts finished the strongest with Tom Roebuck adding to Cowan-Dickie's score for his first international try. It was Borthwick's side's first win since June when they comfortably beat Japan 52-17 in Tokyo. Former England head coach Jones, who was sacked by the Rugby Football Union in 2022 and later replaced by Borthwick, kept a low profile in the build-up to his return, having been in charge during England's joint-worst run since 2018 of five straight defeats. His successor ends the year with five wins from 12 games as Borthwick continues to navigate a tough transition period following a third-placed finish at last year's Rugby World Cup. At least one statement scalp would have been expected after signs of progress in this year's Six Nations and during the summer Tests against New Zealand, meaning a sole win over Japan to end a dreadful run will instead go down as an autumn to forget.\n\nDespite three intense fixtures on the bounce, Borthwick opted against wholesale changes as he offered his regulars a chance to finish the autumn on a high. The final quarter of matches has proved to be England's sticking point in recent games, with late leads blown against New Zealand and Australia. What has remained a strength is their ability to start fast and that continued when Marcus Smith sent Ollie Lawrence through a hole and the Bath centre found Earl who ran under the posts for the opening score. Flanker Underhill then showed his power for the second week in a row close to the try-line to extend the lead, before captain George dotted down twice from rampaging mauls. That ability to close out a tight Test match was never likely to be challenged by the Brave Blossoms, who despite improvement under Jones, were heavily defeated by New Zealand and France this autumn. However, Japan's high-paced attacking style finally clicked as Saito got on the end of Dylan Riley's break after some slick handling from inside their own half. But the hosts were able to respond through an equally impressive flowing move when Will Stuart's initial break led to Sleightholme's sharp finish in the corner, as the Northampton Saints wing showed his instinctive finishing ability by regathering his own grubber kick for a fourth autumn try.\n\nTommy Freeman set up George Furbank's try with a sublime behind-the-back pass\n\nAn outrageous piece of skill from Freeman, who flung the ball behind his back to set up club team-mate Furbank, then raised the volume in an Allianz Stadium. In their games against the All Blacks and world champions South Africa, England had failed to score after the 60th minute. Following Himeno's try, any concern over whether they could finish strongly was quickly answered by Cowan-Dickie's second try from close range. Replacement Roebuck, who impressed off the bench, showed his lethal finishing skills from Fin Smith's crossfield kick, fending off one defender before a sharp step sent him over. For England, a full house of victories over rugby's big three southern hemisphere sides was always a big ask. Small margins prevented them from picking up at least one other victory than this, but ending their miserable run was at least a step forward for Borthwick after a challenging month.",
    "Pubs face widespread closures unless the chancellor announces an extension to business rates relief in next week's Budget, the UK's biggest pub company has warned. David McDowall, boss of Stonegate Group, whose pubs include Slug & Lettuce, Yates's and Walkabout, said thousands of landlords currently make just 12p of profit for every pint of beer they sell. Help on business rates for the hospitality sector in England and Wales is set to run out in April. Mr McDowall said that if it is removed, small publicans will see their business rates bill quadruple from April.\n\nAlong with other costs the businesses are facing, he feared \"they don\u2019t have any more to give\". Rates relief was introduced for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes in 2020 in response to the Covid pandemic when businesses were forced to close. In the Budget in November last year, the then Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced it had been extended until April next year. The measure means that companies in England can claim 75% relief on business rates up to \u00a3110,000, or 40% for firms in Wales. Mr McDowall told the BBC's Today programme that the hospitality industry has faced a \"barrage\" of challenges in recent years. These include recovering from Covid as well as high inflation, energy costs in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the effect of the cost of living on customers. \"The complete removal of that rate relief would prove very, very costly for pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes up and down the length and breath of the UK\", he said. The British Beer and Pub Association recently revealed that landlords make 12p profit per pint. The average price of a pint of draught lager was \u00a34.79 in September, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile, a freeze on alcohol duty is scheduled to end on 1 February next year. Mr McDowall is one of a number of representatives from the hospitality industry who this week signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves asking for relief to be extended. It warned about \"the onrushing business rates cliff edge\" facing firms 153 days after she delivers the Budget.\n\nOn Thursday, UKHospitality and the British Retail Consortium, whose members also benefit from relief, said that in the year to March, businesses in these sectors paid nearly \u00a39bn in business rates. This is nearly a third of the total amount of revenue the government raises from business rates. They said that if relief is removed, it would cost hospitality and retail an additional \u00a32.5bn. Earlier this week, UKHospitality also called on the chancellor to stick to Labour's manifesto pledge to reform business rates. The amount businesses pay is based on how much annual rent could be charged on the premises - which is known as the rateable value. UKHospitality argued that, because its businesses can usually be found in central locations such as High Streets, the cost to companies is high. Without reform \"investment in our high streets will be curtailed, employment opportunities will be squandered and ultimately, we will see higher levels of business failure,\" it said. A spokesperson for the Treasury, said: \u201cWe\u2019re supporting businesses like our well-loved pubs through pledges to make the business rates system fairer, cap corporation tax at 25% and to publish a corporate tax roadmap so that they have some welcome certainty to plan for the future.\u201d\n\nWhat do you want to see in the Budget, how do you think it will affect you personally and what would you like us to explain?",
    "Comedian Godley to go on 'final tour' before funeral\n\nGodley died on 2 November while receiving palliative care for terminal cancer\n\nThe funeral of comedian Janey Godley will take place over two days across two cities as part of a \u201cfinal tour\u201d of Scotland. A hearse will travel through Edinburgh on 29 November in tribute to her \u201cbeloved festival home\u201d before returning to Glasgow on 30 November for the ceremony. The funeral for the comic, who died on 2 November aged 63 after receiving palliative care for terminal cancer, will take place at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral in the city\u2019s west end. Her daughter, Ashley Storrie, confirmed the arrangements on social media.\n\nGodley, who found viral fame with her dubbed parodies of then Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon's coronavirus news briefings during the pandemic, revealed she had ovarian cancer in November 2021. She had been due to embark on a tour entitled \u201cNot Dead Yet,\u201d but was forced to cancel it after her condition worsened. Godley was given the all-clear in 2022 but later that year announced another scan had shown signs of the disease in her abdomen. In the social media post her daughter said: \"Here's the details of Janey's final tour, thank you for all the love and kindness in this past week. \"For the past few years of Ma's life, it was important to her that she shared her journey with everyone, to offer support for others on the same path and to highlight the symptoms of Ovarian Cancer - all of course in her very singular Janey style, with laughter and candour. \"So many of you who have travelled with us on this journey wish to bid her a final farewell, so here's the details of my mum's final tour, in the two cities she loved with all her heart.\"\n\nThe hearse will travel along the Royal Mile and Lawnmarket in Edinburgh with a \"pause for reflection\" at St Giles' Cathedral before travelling along Cockburn Street, Market Street and on to Glasgow. After the funeral on Saturday there will be a private service at a crematorium. Ms Storrie said her mother asked that instead of traditional funeral attire, those who wish to do so should wear bright colours to celebrate her life. She also asked that no flowers be sent but said people were invited to contribute to the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice or any charity of their choice. Godley won the inaugural Sir Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow Award at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival. She died peacefully in the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow, surrounded by her loved ones, her management company said last weekend.",

Aftermath of deadly Israeli strike on press building in Lebanon\n\nThree Lebanese journalists have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a building known to be housing reporters in south-eastern Lebanon, witnesses have told the BBC. The attack was carried out on a guesthouse in a compound in Hasbaya being used by more than a dozen journalists from at least seven media organisations - with a courtyard containing cars clearly marked with \"press\". The men worked for broadcasters Al-Manar TV and Al Mayadeen TV, which issued statements paying tribute to their killed employees. Lebanon's information minister said the attack was deliberate and described it as a \"war crime\". The Israeli military says it targeted a Hezbollah structure, but is reviewing the incident.\n\nThose killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and engineer Mohamed Reda from pro-Iranian news channel Al Mayadeen, as well as camera operator Wissam Qassem from the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar. The Lebanese ministry of health said three others were injured in the blast. Five reporters had been killed in prior Israeli strikes in Lebanon, including Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah. Footage broadcast by Al-Jadeed TV - whose journalists were also sharing the house - showed a bombed-out building with a collapsed roof and floors covered in rubble. A vehicle used for TV broadcasts was overturned on its side, its satellite dish mangled with cabling nearby. \"All official parties were told that this house was being used as a stay-house for journalists. We coordinated with them all,\" an Al-Jadeed journalist, caked in concrete dust, said in a live broadcast while panting and coughing. Lebanese journalists covering the conflict in the south of the country had to relocate from nearby Marj'youn to Hasbaya, as the former became too dangerous. In a statement hours after the incident, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had struck a Hezbollah military structure in Hasbaya from where \u201cterrorists were operating\u201d. The incident showed that proximity to \"terrorist infrastructure poses a danger\u201d, the force said. It added: \u201cSeveral hours after the strike, reports were received that journalists had been hit during the strike. The incident is under review.\u201d\n\nYoumna Fawwaz, a reporter for broadcaster MTV Lebanon, told the BBC that journalists in the compound were awoken at around 03:00 local time (01:00 BST) by the strike. She said ceilings had fallen in on them, and they were surrounded by rubble and dust, with the sound of fighter jets overhead. Each news organisation had their own building in the compound, she said, and the building housing the Al Mayadeen reporters was \"obliterated\" while Al-Manar employees were inside. Ms Fawwaz said it was a media compound known as such to both Israel and Hezbollah. \"The airstrike was carried out on purpose. Everyone knew we were there. All the cars were labelled as press and TV. There wasn't even a warning given to us.\" She added: \"They are trying to terrorise us just like they do in Gaza. Israelis are trying to prevent us from covering the story.\" Lebanon's information minister accused Israel of intentionally targeting journalists, in contravention of international law. \"The Israeli enemy waited for the journalists' nighttime break to betray them in their sleep,\" Ziad Makary wrote in a post on X. \"This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with prior planning and design, as there were 18 journalists there representing seven media institutions.\"\n\nHasbaya, about five miles (eight kilometres) from the Israeli border, is inhabited by Muslims, Christians, as well as people from the Druze ethnic and religious minority. It has seen attacks on its peripheries in recent weeks, but this was the first strike on the settlement itself. The attack comes as part of an expanding conflict in Lebanon, where Israel has been intensifying air strikes for weeks - as well as launching a ground invasion on border towns and villages in the south. On Friday UN peacekeepers said they were forced to withdraw from an observation post in Zahajra, in the south-west, after it was fired on by Israeli forces earlier this week. Unifil has accused Israel of targeting its bases several times in recent weeks, causing injuries to peacekeepers. Israel denies this and has blamed previous incidents on clashes with nearby Hezbollah fighters. In the northern Bekaa area, the Israeli military has confirmed it attacked the Jousieh border crossing between Syria and Lebanon overnight - which it said was being used by Hezbollah and Syrian security forces to smuggle weapons. Lebanese authorities have recorded over 1,700 air strikes across the country in the past three weeks. Hostilities broke out between Israel and Hezbollah on 8 October last year, the day after Hamas's attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people. The Iran-backed armed group has since been firing rockets and drones into Israel in what it described as \"solidarity\" with Palestinians in Gaza. Nearly 2,600 people in Lebanon have been killed in the current conflict, according to the country's health ministry - many of the deaths occurring since Israel began escalating its attacks on 23 September. Around 60,000 people in northern Israel have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire, and the Israeli government has declared returning them to their homes to be a key objective. Two people were killed on Friday in a Hezbollah rocket attack on Majd al-Krum, a town near Karmiel in Israel's north, according to a statement, external from the country's foreign ministry. In southern Lebanon, satellite imagery examined by the BBC shows Israel's intensified bombing campaign has caused more damage to buildings in two weeks than occurred during a year of cross-border fighting. Data shows that more than 3,600 buildings in Lebanon appear to have been damaged or destroyed between 2 and 14 October - about 54% of the total damage. The attack on journalists in Lebanon comes days after the Israeli military accused six Al Jazeera journalists working in northern Gaza of being affiliated with Hamas or other armed Palestinian groups. The Qatari broadcaster said it denies and \"vehemently condemns\" the allegations. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 123 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a war in the territory last year. Gaza's Hamas-run health authority has reported more than 42,000 people killed since. Two Israeli journalists have also been killed in the conflict.",
    "Lucy Letby discussed the death of a baby in a \"gossipy way\", the inquiry has heard\n\nLucy Letby emailed her colleagues at the Countess of Chester Hospital claiming she had been \"exonerated\" and asking them to be \"sensitive and supportive\". The Thirlwall Inquiry into Letby's crimes heard the former nurse wrote the email in January 2017, six months after she had been removed from frontline clinical duties. She claimed that \"a thorough investigation\" had established that \"all allegations were unfounded and untrue\u201d and that she had \"received a full apology\" from the hospital trust. Letby had been moved into an administrative role after a group of consultant paediatricians persistently raised concerns about the deaths and collapses of babies on the neonatal ward.\n\nSix months later the consultants were told to apologise to Letby after two independent reviews reported there was no evidence of deliberate harm. A grievance procedure against her removal from the ward had also been upheld. The email said: \"As you can imagine this whole episode has been distressing for me and my family. \"I will begin my return to the unit in the coming weeks. I will need colleagues to be sensitive and supportive at this time.\" Letby never returned to the unit, which the inquiry previously heard was down to the \"persistence\" of consultants who suspected her of being a murderer. The inquiry also heard from a nurse who recalled Letby telling her about the death of a child in an \"excited\" and \"gossipy\" way. Melanie Taylor said she could not remember which baby's death Letby was referring to, but recalled how she spoke about it. She said: \"It was almost in a way that she was excited to tell me, almost in a gossipy manner.\" The inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall is examining how the killer nurse was able to murder and attack babies at the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2015 and 2016.\n\nLady Justice Thirlwall is chairing the inquiry, which is being held at Liverpool Town Hall\n\nRachel Langdale KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Ms Taylor if the way Letby spoke about the baby's death struck her as unusual or disrespectful. Ms Taylor said: \"Yes, it did. There were parts of [Letby's] personality that were a little strange to me, so I took that as a personality difference between me and her.\" The inquiry also heard about text messages Letby had written about the death of a baby who was later found to be one of her victims. Ms Taylor said the message showed a \"lack of compassion\". In the messages, Letby said she wanted to get back to the nursery where the boy died to get over the death. Her colleague replied Letby needed to \"let it go or it'll eat you up\". Letby said: \"I need to go back and have a sick baby [to take care of], otherwise the image of the one you've lost never leaves you.\"\n\nMs Taylor told the inquiry she had never heard of going back to the unit where a death occurred as a way of dealing with or getting over trauma. When asked what she thought about Letby wanting to go back to the nursery where the baby had died, Ms Taylor said it was \"highly inappropriate\", adding: \"The text messages I've seen show a lack of compassion.\" Ms Taylor told the inquiry she did not have any suspicions at the time that Letby could be harming babies. \"That's an unthinkable thing in a way. \"Nursing is a profession where you put your trust in each other, and I mean this is not an event that happens in anybody's lifetime.\" Another nurse told the inquiry Letby had shouted at her for suggesting she should take a break from working on the intensive care unit after a baby died. Nurse Kathryn Percival Calderbank said she had made the suggestion for Letby to spend time on the special care unit - where babies were not as poorly - so she could do nice things like feed and cuddle babies. \"She was really angry with me. She felt it was boring looking after special care babies,\" she said. Letby, 34, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after being convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016. The inquiry is expected to sit until early next year, with findings published by late autumn 2025.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Man who got on 'wrong plane' arrested\n\nEasyJet said a passenger had \"incorrectly\" boarded the plane\n\nA flight was delayed at Manchester Airport after a man \"incorrectly\" boarded the plane, EasyJet has said. The BBC understands an airport passenger had been due to fly on another EasyJet flight but gained entry to the Milan-bound flight on Friday evening in error. All passengers had to disembark the plane as extra security checks were carried out in line with standard procedure. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said a man had \"embarked on a flight without the correct documentation\".\n\nNothing suspicious was found on board and there was no suggestion that it was terror-related. An EasyJet spokesman said that the flight was \"subject to additional security checks, in line with procedures, due to a passenger incorrectly boarding the flight\". \"Safety and security is our highest priority and so we will now work with our ground partner at Manchester Airport to understand how he was able to board the flight.\" On Saturday, a GMP spokesman said a man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of hiding himself with the purpose of \"being carried in an aircraft without consent and intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\". An EasyJet spokesman said the company was \"not able to provide further details while [the investigation] is ongoing\"."
